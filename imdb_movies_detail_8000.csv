The Mosasaurus is seen pulling a fishing boat down after grabbing its cage of fish with its jaws. Many people have died from dino-related incidents, and while many think the prehistoric animals should be all killed off, others have found a way in the black market to illegally sell and distribute captured all of Prehistoric Animals. The government hands the reins to BioSyn Genetics, a company led by Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) with the promise to keep the dinosaurs held at a sanctuary in Italy's Dolemite Mountains to further research them for pharmaceutical purposes. News coverage also notes that Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) has disappeared after her true nature as a clone was made public.At a facility in Nevada, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda) save a baby dinosaur from an illegal breeding site. They join Franklin Webb (Justice Smith) as they escape in a van, but security guards chase after them until the three manage to lose them. Franklin and Zia tell Claire they can no longer keep this type of work up, and while they support Claire and her endeavors, they are moving onto jobs that are safer for them.Somewhere near the snowy mountains in Nevada, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is riding a horse to wrangle a large dinosaurs. After he's done, he goes back to the cabin that he shares with Claire and Maisie, as he and Claire are now her adoptive parents. Although Maisie likes to stray from home and witness the dinosaurs on land, Claire and Owen try to keep her hidden for fear that someone is after her. This causes her to get annoyed with them, and she has also become curious about Charlotte Lockwood, whom she was cloned from. Sure enough, mercenaries led by Rainn Delacourt (Scott Haze) are spying on them in the woods, Maisie being their target.Not far from the cabin, Blue the raptor has asexually reproduced a child (who Maisie later names Beta). They go hunting together.In Texas, two children are chased by an enormous swarm of locusts. This is brought to the attention of paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). She investigates the farm where the locusts attacked and ate up all the crops. Ellie is told by the children's mother that the neighboring crops, which were untouched by the locusts, are planted by BioSyn.Ellie reunites with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), who is working with other aspiring paleontologists. She brings a captured locust to him and explains the situation, fearing that if they spread, they may wreck the food chain. Alan and Ellie figure that BioSyn must have made them so that their crops are all that remains. Ellie wants to get DNA from another locust at the BioSyn sanctuary and asks for Alan's help. She was already invited by their old friend, Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). Despite showing some hesitance, Alan ultimately agrees to join.Back at the cabin, Blue and Beta come upon Owen, Claire, and Maisie. They are all surprised to see Blue has become a mother. The mercenaries soon make their move and capture Beta. Maisie rides her bike across the bridge and is also taken by the villains. Owen sees this and gets Claire to go after them. Claire says she knows who can help them.Claire contacts Franklin, who now works for the CIA. He helps them get info on Delacourt and points them to Owen's former coworker at Jurassic World, Barry Sembene (Omar Sy), who can help take them to wherever the mercenaries are taking Maisie and Beta.Alan and Ellie arrive at the sanctuary and meet Ramsay Cole (Mamoudou Athie), BioSyn's Head of Communications. He introduces them to Dodgson, who promises they are working on something revolutionary and groundbreaking. Alan and Ellie are escorted to find Ian giving a lecture. Afterwards, he joins them and discreetly tells Ellie that the locusts are indeed part of a sinister scheme by BioSyn. Meanwhile, Dodgson meets with Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong), who has since become remorseful of his actions in helping keep these experiments going, as he notes that the locusts have grown at an alarming rate.In Malta, an associate of Dodgson's, Sonoya Santos (Dichen Lachman), calls him to say that Maisie and Beta have been transported separately to BioSyn HQ. Owen and Claire also arrive and reunite with Barry. He brings them to a black market dinosaur ring, where animals are being sold, eaten, or forced to fight. Claire meets Kayla Watts (DeWanda Wise), a pilot who flies for the vendors. She warns Claire about messing with anyone there, but eventually agrees to help Claire find Maisie. As this happens, Owen and Barry stay hidden and witness Delacourt meeting with Santos to smuggle Atrociraptors. The two confront and fight Delacourt and his men. Owen orders him to say where Maisie and Beta are, and he just gives him Santos' name before he gets eaten by dinosaurs in the fighting ring. Claire fights Santos and learns that Maisie is headed for BioSyn, and she outruns a loose dinosaur before joining Kayla. Barry arrests Santos, but not before she sics one of her dinosaurs on Owen, who is riding a motorcycle to catch up with Claire and Kayla. He manages to board Kayla's plane just as she is getting ready to take off with Claire, and Owen uses the motorcycle to knock the dino off the ramp and into the ocean.Maisie arrives at HQ and meets Wu. He explains to her that while she is a clone of Charlotte's, she is also her actual daughter because she gave birth to her. Maisie watches video footage of Charlotte (Elva Trill), and sees when she was pregnant with Maisie. Charlotte suffered from a genetic disease, but she managed to alter Maisie's DNA to remove all traces of the disease. Wu hopes that by studying Maisie's DNA, he can reverse the locust outbreak by altering their DNA.Alan and Ellie sneak into the containment room for the locusts to get a DNA sample, just as Maisie tries to escape with Beta. Dodgson sounds the alarm, which causes the locusts to swarm around Alan and Ellie, but they manage to get out safely. They meet Maisie, who knows who they are. She joins them as they run. They are found by Ramsay, who agrees to help them because he finds BioSyn's work to be unethical. He sends them away in a monorail to safety. Ellie tells Maisie that she knew Charlotte as a student, and says she was a brilliant and kind person.In the air, Kayla's plane is attacked by a real Quetzalcoatlus, forcing Claire to eject and fall into the trees after they rip her parachute. Owen and Kayla crash into a nearby ice lake. They attempt to safely make their way across it but are chased by another dinosaur. The two make it across just in time and head off to relocate Claire. She gets down from the tree but has to quietly evade a Pyroraptor that has been stalking her in the forest. Owen and Kayla hide as the T-Rex makes her appearance to eat, but she is held off by a Smurfette's DNA called Giganotosaurus, a much larger predator. They manage to get to Claire.Alan, Ellie, and Maisie are making their way through caverns and find dinosaurs attacking, prompting them to run until they make it outside. Meanwhile, Ian tears Dodgson a new one for his actions, and Dodgson fires him. Ian works with Ramsay to get back to Ian's friends. He helps them escape the dinosaurs by freeing them from the enclosure. Dodgson then sets fire to the locust lab to destroy evidence. The flaming locusts break free and begin flying out into the open. Alan, Ellie, Ian, and Maisie attempt to outrun a large dinosaur in a van but are knocked down a hill. Luckily, they land near Owen, Claire, and Kayla, reuniting the former two with Maisie. Claire also gets to meet Ellie while Owen meets Alan. The group is then stalked by the Giganotosaurus, who almost gets Maisie, but she escapes. Ian fends it off by throwing a burning cloth into its mouth.While the heroes work on an escape plan, BioSyn starts to burn to the ground, forcing the employees to flee. Dodgson attempts to make off with his work, and Ramsay tells him off one last time before leaving. Dodgson attempts to get away in the monorail, but is cornered by a trio of Dilophosaurus, who make a meal out of him. Beta comes upon the heroes and is sedated so they can safely bring her along. They are also found by Wu, who has found a way to alter the locusts' DNA to stop the spread. Just as the group prepares their leave, the Giganotosaurus reappears, but is then caught between the T-Rex and a Therizinosaurus. The humans flee to avoid the dino fight, and it ends when the T-Rex pushes the Giganotosaurus into the Therizinosaurus's claws.Upon returning to safety, Alan and Ellie rekindle their romance and later head to Washington DC to testify against BioSyn. Wu's work is a success and stops the locust spread. Owen, Claire, and Maisie return home and reunite Beta with Blue. Before retreating back into the forest, Blue shares one last look with Owen.One final voiceover proclaims that dinosaurs and humans must adapt in order to co-exist.","Four years after the destruction of Isla Nublar, Biosyn operatives attempt to track down Maisie Lockwood, while Dr Ellie Sattler investigates a genetically engineered swarm of giant insects."

Caruso'],"Sarah ""Angel"", who was sold into prostitution at the age of eight, survives through hatred and self-loathing in 1850s California. When God orders Michael Hosea to marry her, he obeys him, but this command proves to be more of a challenge to him than he anticipated. Before being sold into prostitution, Sarah knows only rejection from men. As a child, she overhears her father, Alex Stanford, say that she should never have been born. Sarah learns that her father is married and her mother, Mae, is both his mistress and the victim of an abusive relationship. Sarah watches her mother grieve and eventually die, rejected by the man she loves. Now eighteen and going by the name Angel, she believes that she knows everything about men and how to give them what they want. One night, one of her customers is her father, and she knowingly has sex with him to punish him for how he treated her mother. He does not recognize her, but when he finds out the next morning, he commits suicide. When Michael enters her room and tells her he wants to marry her, she is thrown off guard, but remains aloof toward him. After she is nearly beaten to death, she agrees to marry Michael and leave with him as he nurses her back to health. Michael continues to surprise her as he claims to love her as his wife, and refuses to have sex with her. Michael is different from any man Angel has ever known, which leaves her confused and afraid to trust him. She runs away at her first opportunity, but Michael finds her and convinces her to come home. The next time Angel runs away, she gets a ride with Michael's brother-in-law, Paul, who hates her because of her past. When he demands payment for the ride, she pays by allowing Paul to have sex with her. Back in the city, Angel is forced back into prostitution, but finds it more difficult now to remain distant. When an angry Michael arrives at the brothel and takes her home again, the relief on her face when she sees him gives him hope and allows him to forgive her. For the first time, Angel is truly honest with Michael about her past, and their relationship begins to grow based on honesty and affection. Angel does not run away from Michael again for a long time. But when she is terrified to find herself falling in love with him, she remembers what love did to her mother, and forces herself to leave. This time, however, she stays away from her old life, and is able to make an honest living for the first time in her life. When Michael finds her yet again, she confesses that she ran away because she was scared to love him, and he assures her that she can trust him. She agrees to go home with him again. The final time Angel runs away, it is not because she does not love Michael, or because she is scared of her love, but out of a desire to sacrifice for him. She knows that what Michael wants most in the world is children and she is unable to bear children herself. She believes that by leaving, Michael will find someone else to marry and be happier without her. When she leaves this time, she intends to stay away forever, but Michael does not go after her, deciding that she needs to come back on her own. Angel is gone for three years, and has started a successful mission to help other young prostitutes, when Paul finally comes to find her. Paul realizes that he has been wrong all this time and tells Angel that Michael still loves her. Angel returns home to Michael, offering her love and her life. He is overjoyed when she gives him the only gift she has left to give, that being her real name, Sarah. God shows his faithfulness to Michael and Sarah throughout their lives, miraculously blessing them with children and success in all their endeavors, and they are happily married for the rest of their lives.","Sold into prostitution as a child, Angel knows nothing but betrayal. Can her heart ever be mended? Based upon the novel by Francine Rivers."

Nursing a gambling addiction that has left him destitute, he recounts how he first met the future King of Rock and Roll.
In 1973 Parker was exposed as a fraud, who took 50% of Elvis's income, worked him like a mule to support his own gambling addiction. He was thought to be responsible for Elvis's death.Raised mostly by his doting mother Gladys (Helen Thomson), Presley spends his childhood in the poorest parts of Mississippi (after his father was jailed for check fraud, he and his mother had to take up accommodation in the black part of town), finding an escape in the comic book adventures of Captain Marvel Jr. and especially in song. However, upon moving with his parents to Memphis, he is ridiculed by his peers due to his fascination with the African American music of Memphis's Beale Street. At this time, Parker is a carnival ""huckster"" who fancies himself a modern-day P. T. Barnum. Although partnered with country singer Hank Snow (David Wenham), Parker immediately realizes Presley's crossover potential when he hears the white artist ""sounding black"" on the groundbreaking single, ""That's All Right."" Presley uses African American rhythms in his songs. That night, he sees Presley at a ""Louisiana Hayride"" performance, discovering a talented musician with strong sex appeal among the females (with the way he moves & shakes his legs). Even now Presley hung around the African American parts of town and adapted their clothing and music styles in his performances.
Presley was contracted with Sam Phillips of Sun Records, who wanted to record black music, only it wasn't selling like it should. Parker takes Presley on tour with Hank Snow and soon Presley is the major attraction. Women start throwing themselves at Presley and he starts having sex with them at his hotel room. He starts doing drugs as well to keep up with the schedule.At a Ferris Wheel, Parker meets with Presley and persuades him to let him take exclusive control of his career. He says that Parker would have to give up Hank and represent Presley exclusively and thus argues for a higher share of earnings. he says they need a record company of national distribution and tells Presley to convince Sun Records to sell their contract to RCA. Rock stars need to have an ""available"" status and hence Presley has to give up his girlfriend. Presley is made into a family business, with dad Vernon (Richard Roxburgh) as its business manager. The entire family enters into a legally binding contract with Parker.This is the beginning a meteoric ascent that sees the Presley family lifted out of poverty. Parker lands him a 7-movie deal and merchandise deals. The regional public is divided in their view of the singer. Feeling that Presley's music will corrupt white children of and stoke racial hostility, segregationist Southern Democrat Mississippi Senator James Eastland (Nicholas Bell) calls Parker to an informal hearing, during which he questions Parker about his mysterious past.
Presley agrees to do one family show without his trademark moves, but it is a disaster. Presley gets a lot of flak for it and is furious at Parker for making him change. Gladys blames Parker for their woes. B.B. King (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) is Presley's mentor and runs a African American club downtown. He advises Presley to start his own label. He also says that there is no way Presley, a famous white boy, will ever go to jail for dancing like an African American. He says there must be another reason why Parker guided him the way he did.After Presley's charged dance moves at a concert, the singer faces potential legal trouble. Parker persuades the government to draft Presley into the US Army instead to avoid legal entanglements. During his military service in West Germany (In 1958 for 2 years), Presley is devastated by his mother's alcoholism-induced death. Parker replaces Gladys and handholds Presley out of depression.
Presley finds some solace when he meets Priscilla Beaulieu (Olivia DeJonge), the adopted teenage daughter of an United States Air Force pilot. After his discharge, he resumes his movie career, and years later, he marries Priscilla in 1966 (honeymoon on Frank Sinatra's jet). Presley gets movie work for Priscilla and his entire Memphis mafia. Lisa Marie was born shortly thereafter.As the popular culture of the 1960s passes Presley by (The Beatles were on the ascendancy), the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy devastate him. Although he wants to become more politically outspoken in his music, Parker only allows him to release frivolous feel-good songs for a Christmas special television. However, this does not dissuade him. He meets Steve Binder (Dacre Montgomery), who put Steve and the Rolling Stones together. Presley's performance choices in the special, including the closing number, ""If I Can Dream"", are presented and perceived as acts of not only his past songs, but also political commentary. Infuriated corporate sponsors threaten litigation, while a disgusted Parker believes Presley has been ""brainwashed by hippies."" Nevertheless, the show is massively successful.Parker is infuriated that Binder is guiding Presley that he no longer needs Parker. Binder gets more involved with Presley and books him on overseas tours paying $ 1 MM per night. He says that Parker refused 2 such offers in the previous year, although he can't figure out why.
It is revealed that Parker is under gambling debts. Plus, there was no colonel Parker to begin with and Parker is actually Andreas Van Kuijk, an illegal immigrant from Netherlands.After the special, Presley headlines at the largest showroom in Las Vegas, the International Hotel, and then resumes concert tours. Parker's control of Presley's life tightens further as he refuses Presley's request for a world tour despite initially promising him and manipulates him (by making it look like there are death threats against Presley and by staging attacks on stage on him at the International Hotel, to make the threats looks real and credible) into signing a contract for a lengthy Las Vegas casino residency at the International Hotel ($1 MM per year for 5 years in exchange for Parker's debt being canceled).Parker goads Presley into doing US tours instead. 15 cities in 15 days, which they do in 1969, 70, 71 and 72. Presley's behavioral issues and prescription drug addiction overtake him, and a despondent Priscilla divorces him on January 8, 1973, taking their daughter Lisa Marie with her. Presley discovers that Parker cannot leave the country, because he is a stateless illegal immigrant named Andreas (Dries) van Kuijk and fires him on September 3, 1973.Parker and Presley argue over Presley's $8 million debt to Parker and the record label for his numerous lavish expenses, straining Presley's relationship with his father. Parker is able to convince Presley of their symbiotic relationship and, while they rarely see each other afterward, Parker continues as his manager.Presley continues a rigorous schedule of shows that leaves him increasingly exhausted. In 1974, before his death on August 16, 1977, Presley expresses his greatest fear to Priscilla of being forgotten after he dies. At one of his final shows on June 21, 1977, in Rapid City, South Dakota, Presley, now bloated and pale, sings ""Unchained Melody"" and ends the performance to thunderous applause. As he finishes his recollection, Parker dies on January 21, 1997, impoverished and alone, while Presley is beloved worldwide and is the best-selling solo artist in history, with his influence and legacy on music continuing to this day.
Parker's financial abuse of Elvis was exposed after Elvis's death in a series of lawsuits. He settled out of court.","The life of American music icon Elvis Presley, from his childhood to becoming a rock and movie star in the 1950s while maintaining a complex relationship with his manager, Colonel Tom Parker."

Pearl's father is infirm and paralyzed, and her domineering mother emphasizes the importance that Pearl care for him and help maintain their farm. Pearl, lonely, prone to whimsy and longing for a more exciting life, is captivated by the films she sees at the local cinema and aspires to become a chorus girl, much to her mother's disapproval. Pearl indulges in abusing the liquid morphine provided to her father to manage his pain.At the cinema, Pearl meets a young projectionist who takes a liking to her. While riding her bicycle home, Pearl stops along a cornfield and begins dancing with a scarecrow, fantasizing about the projectionist, and sits on top of it. She later sneaks out of the house at night and visits the projectionist, who shows her A Free Ride, an illicit stag film he acquired in Europe. He encourages Pearl to pursue her dreams while she is still young, and suggests she seek a career in Europe. Pearl comments that she cannot abandon her family, and that she wishes they were dead.Pearl's younger and wealthier sister-in-law, Mitzy, tells her of an audition being held to acquire new dancers for a traveling troupe, which Pearl envisions as a way out of her circumstance. When her mother finds a pamphlet Pearl took from the cinema, she confronts her at dinner. The two get into a fierce argument, during which Pearl's mother chastises her for only focusing on her wants and aspirations, before cruelly telling Pearl that she considers her a ""failure"", and that she has seen a malevolence in Pearl that terrifies her. A physical altercation erupts, during which Pearl shoves her mother against the kitchen hearth, igniting her dress and resulting in her mother suffering life-threatening burns. Pearl looks in shock at her mother's dress burning and quickly douses the flames, which leaves her mother unconscious. Pearl drags her mother, still alive, into the basement, and leaves her father seated in the kitchen. She flees to the cinema, where she has sex with the projectionist.In the morning, the projectionist drives Pearl back to the farm so she can prepare for the audition. He becomes unnerved when he notices a maggot-infested roasted pig on the porch, which Mitzy's mother left for them the day prior. He is further perturbed by inconsistencies Pearl has told him. When he attempts to leave, Pearl flies into a fit of rage, feeling she is again being abandoned. As he tries to drive away, she stabs him to death with a pitchfork before pushing his car-with his corpse in it-into a pond, where an alligator she has nicknamed Theda eats his remains. Pearl checks on her mother, who lay semi-conscious on the basement stairs and appears to either die or pass out a few seconds later, and chides her before kicking her down the staircase. Pearl dresses herself in one of her mother's lavish gowns, and bathes and dresses her father in a suit before smothering him to death, justifying it as a mercy killing.Pearl arrives at the church where the audition is being held, and is met by a nervous Mitzy, who insists she go before her. Pearl gives a dance performance she feels will win the talent scouts over, but is profoundly distraught when they deny her for being ""not blonde"" or what they're looking for. Mitzy accompanies Pearl home and attempts to calm her. In the kitchen, Pearl makes a lengthy confession to Mitzy about her resentment toward Howard, who came to work at her family home as a farmhand; Pearl saw her marriage to Howard, the son of an upper-class family, as a way to escape her parents, but was crestfallen when he insisted the two remain on her family's farm. She further confesses her feelings of alienation and insecurity, and admits to having begun murdering farm animals before taking the lives of her parents and the projectionist, which she regrets especially in the case of her father. She finishes by saying that she really loves Howard, that being loved is all she really wants and that she'll try to make the farm a home if that's what he wants. A stunned Mitzy attempts to leave, nervously assuring Pearl she will not divulge their conversation. Pearl calmly pushes Mitzy to confess that she was chosen for the troupe by the talent scouts, then quietly watches her leave. A few seconds later, she slowly follows Mitzy onto the porch and grabs an axe. Mitzy attempts to flee. Pearl chases her down the driveway and brutally kills her with an axe.Pearl dismembers Mitzy's body and feeds her corpse to Theda, before going into the basement and lying with her dead mother, whom she tells she loves. Having reached the conclusion that her mother is correct, and that Pearl should ""make the best of what she has"", Pearl decides to remediate her wrongdoings by creating a comfortable home for Howard when he returns from combat. The next morning, Howard arrives unexpectedly. In the kitchen, he is horrified to find the dead bodies of Pearl's parents seated at the dining table around the rotting pig. Pearl greets him with a protracted, pained expression of joy.","In 1918, a young woman on the brink of madness pursues stardom in a desperate attempt to escape the drudgery, isolation, and lovelessness of life on her parents' farm."

Andi had committed suicide just 2 days ago and the news of her death has not been announced just yet. On the day of her suicide, she had sent an email to Miles & his entourage, threatening to have a piece of evidence that she can use to bring his entire empire down. Helen is sure that Andi was murdered. Helen could not find the ""evidence"", supposedly in a red envelope, anywhere in her apartment. While she was there, she receives an invitation from Miles (for Andi), to attend a murder mystery at his private Island.Andi was the CEO of Alpha, a technology company she co-founded with Miles Bron (Edward Norton). After refusing to consent to Miles releasing Klear, a potentially dangerous hydrogen-based alternative fuel, Miles ousted Andi from the company, winning a lawsuit she filed against him. Andi was left broke and penniless.Andi's case failed when she was unable to prove that Alpha's founding ideas were hers, in part due to the perjured testimonies of her and Miles' old friends: Alpha head scientist Lionel Toussaint (Leslie Odom Jr.), Connecticut governor Claire Debella (Kathryn Hahn), fashion designer Birdie Jay (Kate Hudson) (former supermodel), and men's rights streamer Duke Cody (Dave Bautista) (a Twitch streamer). Claire's campaign for the senate is funded by Miles. Also, Miles is pressuring Lionel to clear Klear for testing on a manned spaceflight.Miles decides to host a murder mystery weekend at his mansion, the Glass Onion, on his private island in Greece. As Andi was invited and news of her death has not been released, Blanc instructs Helen to pose as Andi for the weekend to help him investigate. Blanc knows that Andi's killer will know the truth about Helen and won't hesitate to kill again to cover their tracks.Reading through Andi's journal, they both figure out that 10 years ago, Andi was the leader of the pack. She introduced Miles to the group. Miles helped make the careers of Birdie, Lionel, Duke and Claire. Andi had the idea of Alpha on a cocktail napkin. 2 years ago, Miles met a scientist in Peru who sold him on this new Hydrogen fuel. Miles is willing to bet Alpha on it. Andi stops him, but Miles worked the lawyers to cut Andi out of Alpha completely. Andi sues, but she didn't have the cocktail napkin to prove that Alpha was her idea. The entourage testifies for Miles and against Andi. Helen suspects that one of the five killed Andi after she found the cocktail napkin (hidden inside one of the books in her apartment) where she had written down the idea for Alpha, which would discredit Miles and prove that all five committed perjury during the lawsuit.They join Lionel, Claire, Birdie, and Duke in traveling to the island. Birdie's assistant Peg (Jessica Henwick) and Duke's girlfriend Whiskey (Madelyn Cline) (Twitch channel assistant) also accompany the group. Upon their arrival, Miles questions Blanc's presence (coz he never sent the invitation box to Blanc), but allows him to stay, assuming that he was invited as a joke arranged by one of the other guests (who reset the invitation puzzles box and sent it to Blanc as a prank). The group doesn't know that Blanc was hired by Helen, and that ""Andi"" is actually Helen. Miles has sent all of his staff home to spend a normal weekend with his friends.Birdie was a big star back when Miles was just starting out. Now the situation is reversed, and Birdie needs Miles's support to even survive. Duke carries a gun at all times. Miles calls all his friends disrupting people. Birdie was a top fashion designer, who had a bad run of a Halloween costume, before coming back strongly with a designer sweatpants, just before Covid hit. Duke is the first influential person with a million followers on twitch. Claire is leading the female charge on capitol hill. Lionel didn't wait to finish his education before he started disrupting science. Miles believes that with Alpha he is also disrupting the world. He is breaking the system itself.Andi says that Miles invested in Birdie sweatpants business, when no one was touching her with a 10-foot pole. He also set up Duke on YouTube and his media empire, after he was banned from twitch for selling rhino bones infused boner pills to teenage boys. Lionel works for Miles and Claire's campaign is funded by him.
Birdie is being forced by Miles to take responsibility for hiring a sweatshop in Bangladesh to manufacture her clothing line, and Duke is attempting to coerce Miles into giving him a position at Alpha News by using Whiskey to seduce him. Blanc sees all this.In a week Miles plans to announce Klear to the world. Klear is a solid hydrogen fuel, derived from seawater. Lionel objects and says he needs 2 years to test and ensure its stability and safety. Miles says his entire island is being run on Klear.Helen searches for clues that could lead to Andi's killer, but only discovers motives for Lionel (he will destroy Lionel if he does not approve of the manned space rocket run on Klear), Claire (he can easily withdraw funding if she does not approve his Klear power plant), Birdie (Birdie is being made to take the fall for the Bangladesh sweatshop to cover his role as the main investor.. He will buy Birdie's shares for $30 million if she takes the fall), and Duke (while having sex with Miles, Whiskey gets him to confess that he has no plans to put Duke in Alpha News, something that he had been dangling in front of Duke for a while) to kill Miles instead. Lionel and Claire have staked their professional reputations to support Klear, only to discover its potentially dangerous qualities afterwards.Helen figures out that after Andi sent the email, Duke, Claire, Birdie, and Lionel came to Andi's house to stop her from using the envelope. But Duke was there first, before anyone else got there. Helen believes each one of them had the opportunity to kill Andi.Blanc deliberately ruins Miles's planned murder mystery by solving it immediately (even before the murder has taken place) in order to allow Helen more time to focus on the guests. Miles shows Blanc the cocktail napkin on which he claims he drew the idea of Alpha and showed it to Andi. While this was going on, Helen searched the rooms of Mile's entourage to find the envelope they stole from Andi. She can't find anything. Just then, media announces the news of Andi's death, but only Helen sees it on her phone.Later that night, as the group parties, Duke suddenly collapses and dies after drinking from Miles's glass, apparently by accident. Blanc wants the police and medical services to be called to the island, but they cannot come till low tide, not before 6 am the following morning. The group panics and suspects ""Andi"" to be the killer before discovering that Duke's pistol is missing. In the ensuing chaos, the group splits up. Blanc finds Helen, who has been searching for Andi's cocktail napkin, and instructs her to search Miles's office (where Miles had shown Blanc the cocktail napkin that he had supposedly used to draw his idea for Alpha). An unknown assailant shoots Helen in the chest, but the bullet is blocked by Andi's journal in her jacket pocket.After helping fake Helen's death, Blanc gathers the rest of the group in Miles' art room (while Helen searches for the napkin in Miles's office) and concludes that Miles committed both murders. After Miles learned of the napkin's existence from Lionel, he killed Andi to prevent her from revealing it to the public. Immediately after the murder, he was seen leaving the house by Duke (who came to Andi's house first and alone), who deduced Miles' involvement with Andi's death once news of it was released on the internet during the party. Duke attempted to blackmail Miles, prompting Miles to poison Duke with pineapple juice, which Duke was allergic to, before using Duke's pistol to shoot Helen.Helen locates the napkin in Miles's office and reveals her true identity to the group. However, Miles burns the napkin and brags that there is no evidence against him. With Blanc unable to help and the group unwilling to side with her, with Blanc's encouragement, Helen destroys Miles' glass sculptures, which motivates the others to do the same, before triggering the Klear-powered mansion to explode by lighting a bonfire and throwing a sample of the fuel into it. This destroys the Glass Onion and the Mona Lisa, which Miles had on loan from the Louvre.With Miles' reputation ruined due to the painting's destruction and Klear being proven dangerous, the group decides they will testify against him. Helen and Blanc sit on the beach as they watch the police arrive.","Tech billionaire Miles Bron invites his friends for a getaway on his private Greek island.

His fiance, nurse Katherine (Susannah Fielding), does not recoil, but tells him he will grow a mustache to hide his scars. In 1937, at a London club, Poirot watches blues singer Salome Otterbourne (Sophie Okonedo) perform and sees Jacqueline ""Jackie"" De Bellefort (Emma Mackey) dancing passionately with her fiance Simon Doyle (Armie Hammer). Jackie's childhood friend, heiress Linnet Ridgeway (Gal Gadot), enters, and is introduced to Simon. Jackie asks Linnet to hire Simon as her estate manager.Six weeks later, in Egypt, Poirot encounters his friend Bouc (Tom Bateman) and Bouc's mother, Euphemia (Annette Bening), a painter. Bouc invites Poirot to join them at the hotel to celebrate the wedding of a surprising couple - Linnet and Simon. Others join their honeymoon trip: Linnet's maid Louise Bourget (Rose Leslie); Salome and her niece/manager Rosalie (Letitia Wright), & Linnet's school-friend; Linnet's godmother Marie Van Schuyler (Jennifer Saunders) with her nurse Mrs. Bowers (Dawn French); Linnet's cousin Andrew Katchadourian (Ali Fazal), who manages her accounts; and doctor Linus Windlesham (Russell Brand). Linnet asks Poirot for protection from the obsessive Jackie, who has stalked them to Egypt; he cannot dissuade Jackie, who shows him she carries a gun.To escape Jackie, the group boards the cruise ship S.S. Karnak. Linnet tells Poirot she does not trust her guests. During an excursion to Abu Simbel, Bouc confesses that he is dating Rosalie, despite his mother's disapproval; Poirot is interested in Salome. After a boulder nearly crushes Linnet and Simon, the guests return to the Karnak to discover Jackie has boarded. Poirot, overcome by champagne, confides to Jackie that he renounced romance after Katherine died in a mortar explosion. Linnet goes to bed and Simon confronts Jackie, who shoots him in the leg and attempts to shoot herself. Rosalie and Bouc intervene. They bring Jackie to Mrs. Bowers, while Windlesham treats Simon. The following morning, Louise discovers Linnet has been shot in the head, and her valuable necklace has been stolen.
Poirot has the captain dredge the areas around the boat to find the murder weapon.Poirot, assisted by Simon and Bouc, interrogates the guests, who each bear a grudge against Linnet:Louise was to leave Linnet's employment to be married, but Linnet ended the engagement by paying off the debt of her fiance. Linnet wanted Louise at all costs.
Windlesham was engaged to Linnet until she left him for Simon. He was along with Simon all night and after sedating him had a clear window of opportunity to attack Linnet.
Andrew was embezzling from Linnet.
Bowers' formerly wealthy family was ruined by Linnet's father, during the Great Depression.
Van Schuyler is a beneficiary of Linnet's will. She and Bowers are lovers.
Salome was the target of Linnet's racist remarks, years ago.
Euphemia finds Linnet's necklace. Poirot suspects she resented Linnet for introducing Bouc to Rosalie.
Jackie was monitored by Bowers all night.

He concludes that she is more than worthy of her son's affection. Rosalie, angry at being investigated, storms off and discovers Louise's body. Her throat has been slit. She has money, so Poirot suspects that she witnessed Linnet's murder and blackmailed the killer.
He sees a possible witness' outline in the blood spatter from Louise on the walls of the ship.
Interrogating Bouc with Simon, Poirot deduces that Bouc found Linnet dead and stole her necklace to gain financial freedom from his mother. He was going to return the necklace, but then saw Louise being killed and panicked and put it in Euphemia's belongings. Bouc witnessed Louise's murder and got blood on his coat, which he threw over the railing, but before he can reveal the killer, he is shot dead; Poirot chases the killer, but only finds the abandoned gun.Locking the surviving guests in the boat's bar, Poirot reveals that Simon killed Linnet, with Jackie acting as mastermind. They are still lovers, and arranged Simon's romance with Linnet to inherit her wealth. Jackie drugged Poirot's champagne and pretended to shoot Simon with a blank. Simon faked his injury with paint stolen from Euphemia. While Jackie distracted Bouc and Rosalie, Simon killed Linnet and then shot his own leg, muffled by Van Schuyler's scarf.
Jackie killed Louise with Windlesham's scalpel (Louise had seen Simon entering Linnet's cabin and was later told by Simon that he would take care of her financially), and Bouc with Andrew's gun.

A convicted murderer, Court Gentry, (Ryan Gosling) is visited by Donald Fitzroy (Billy Bob Thornton), a CIA recruiter. After going over Gentry's files and background, Fitzroy offers him a job working for the Sierra Program.18 years later in Bangkok, Gentry is now employed by the CIA as an assassin under the code-name ""Sierra Six"". He is tasked with taking out a target referred to as ""Dining Cart"" (Callan Mulvey). Aiding him is fellow assassin Dani Miranda (Ana De Armas), while superiors Denny Carmichael (Rege-Jean Page) and Suzanne Brewer (Jessica Henwick) keep eyes on him. Before Six can take out the target, he holds back when a child shows up. Six goes off the plan and goes after Dining Cart when the fireworks outside go off. He and Miranda take out Dining Cart's goons before Six goes after the man himself. After a fight, Six fatally stabs him, but Dining Cart reveals in his dying breaths that he is Sierra Four, and Carmichael sent Six to kill one of his own guys. Four gives Six a necklace with a chip containing information that can bring Carmichael and his cronies down.Carmichael contacts Six after, and he denies recovering anything off of Four. Six then switches clothes with a civilian before logging onto a computer to try and see what is on the chip, but he is lacking a code to log in. Six then contacts Fitzroy, who is in Baku, to inform him that he thinks Carmichael is a bad guy. Fitzroy says he will do what he can to look into it.Carmichael suspects Six knows the truth about him, so he employs the help of a former CIA agent, Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans), to get to Six first before his deeds are exposed, even though Brewer is against it because Hansen is a known sociopath. Carmichael calls Hansen, who is in Monaco torturing a man with electric cables. Hansen is more than happy to go after Six. He finds Fitzroy at a funeral and questions him about Six, but gets no answers. Hansen resorts to having Fitzroy's niece Claire (Julia Butters) be kidnapped as leverage.Six is being escorted by an extraction team in Chiang Mai, when Fitzroy contacts the leader and tells him to quietly take Six out. However, Six is one step ahead of them and begins to fight and kill off the team before causing the plane to blow up and crash. He contacts Fitzroy, who tells him that Hansen has Claire.A flashback shows two years earlier in London, where Six and Fitzroy met with Sierra handler Margaret Cahill (Alfre Woodard). Fitzroy has to take on a mission after his address was leaked, so Six is tasked with babysitting Claire, who has a heart condition. Six bonds with Claire and takes a liking to her, even getting her medical attention when she faints. Some assassins break into Fitzroy's house at night, and Six kills them all before Claire gets out of bed to see what is going on.Back in the present, Six goes to Vienna to meet with his contact, Laszlo Sosa (Wagner Moura). While Six wants his help in getting him a new alias so he can go rescue Claire, Sosa betrays Six and drops him through a trap door so that he can collect the bounty on Six. Hansen and his goons arrive to get Six, but when Sosa demands his money, Hansen shoots him dead. Six sets up a trap as he fills the hole with water, setting off an explosion that takes Hansen's guys out. Six breaks out and kills the other goons before a brief fight with Hansen. Before Hansen can kill him, Six is saved by Miranda after she tranquilizes Hansen in the butt. Miranda is mad at Six as she is already being questioned by Carmichael after the Bangkok mission. She trans him too and puts him in a trunk.Hansen returns to Croatia where Claire is being kept in a mansion, and Fitzroy is brought back to her. Hansen also has his team there, along with Brewer, who chews him out for his actions. After his goons take Claire away, Hansen tortures Fitzroy by ripping off his fingernails for info on Six, but Fitzroy never budges.Six and Miranda go to Cahill's home in Prague now that she is retired. Six sent her the info on the chip, and she reveals to them that it contains all of Carmichael's shady deals and abuse of power. Hansen's guys manage to track them there and sends more assassins. After some gunfire, Cahill gives Six and Miranda a chance to escape. Once the assassins reach her, Cahill blows up her apartment with herself and the bad guys in there. Six and Miranda are chased through the city, leading to more gunfire, stabbings, and explosions as they kill off their pursuers. With all his teams dead, Hansen resorts to sending his own assassin, Lone Wolf (Dhanush).Six and Miranda go to a hospital where Six tracks Claire down using a signal from her pacemaker. Lone Wolf attacks them, leading to a 2-on-1 fight. Wolf tries to turn the police against Six before attacking the police himself. Six and Miranda manage to get away while Six tends to his wounds. There, he tells Miranda about how he killed his father for abusing him and his brother.The two make it to Croatia and initiate a full-on assault against Hansen and his goons. More assassins are taken out, and Six manages to save Fitzroy and Claire. As they make their way out, Fitzroy opts to stay behind to give Six and Claire more of a chance to escape. He uses a grenade to blow himself up along with more assassins, and Claire mourns her uncle. Meanwhile, Miranda fights Wolf, where they nearly kill each other until Wolf just gives her the chip, saying that he no longer wishes to work for dishonorable people like Hansen.Hansen catches up to Six and Claire, and he takes Claire hostage. Six chases him through a hedge maze before they end up at a fountain. Six drops his gun so Hansen will let Claire go. Despite her protests, Six tells her to run so she can be safe.

This will make sense later.Otis Haywood Sr. and his son, Otis Jr. (referred to as OJ), begin their day by taking care of the horses at their Hollywood ranch, Haywood's Hollywood Horses. In the background, a radio mentions the mysterious disappearance of two hikers. Soon, the electricity goes out and, after screams are heard from the sky, debris falls from the sky. A coin falls through Otis Sr.'s eye, killing him. OJ tries to get him to the hospital to no avail. Later, after arriving back at the ranch, OJ notices a key impaled into one of the horses.The opening credits are shown along with a green square, later zooming in to the first motion picture of a black man riding a horse.6 months after the event, OJ waits for his sister Emerald (referred to as Em) on a movie set where one of their horses, Lucky, is to be used for a commercial filmed by cinematographer Antlers Holst. Emerald soon arrives and helps explains the safety precautions of filming with Lucky, also mentioning that the black man on the horse in the first motion picture is her and OJ's great-great-great grandfather. However, the staff ignores them and disrespects the horse's boundaries, causing it to react violently. The Haywoods are fired from the project, with a VFX horse replacing Lucky instead.With the ranch struggling financially, the Haywoods go to meet Ricky ""Jupe"" Park, a former child actor who owns a Western-themed amusement park titled Jupiter's Claim, to sell Lucky to him - the 11th horse to be sold. During the meeting, Jupe recounts an SNL sketch based on a traumatizing event during his child acting career, when a chimp actor went berserk on the set of the sitcom Gordy's Home. Jupe offers to buy the Haywood ranch, and Em later encourages OJ to accept the deal.That night, Em recounts to OJ about how Otis Sr. promised Em that she would train her first horse named Jean Jacket, although the horse would later end up being used for a film, which ended up using another animal anyway. Em notices that Ghost, another horse of theirs, mysteriously ended up in the arena.Starting from this point, the film is divided into chapters, each title referring to the animals in the film. This chapter is titled GHOST.OJ goes to the arena and finds Ghost there. Suddenly, he notices something from far away - several lights and a voice playing on the speakers. The lights and the voice slowly turn off, and Ghost flees the arena. OJ finds Ghost fleeing from the ranch and disappearing while the other horses act violently in the ranch. As the electricity of the Haywood home turns off for a few seconds, OJ sees a flying saucer in the sky.OJ describes it as big and fast to Em. The two buy several cameras the next day at Fry's Electronics, seeking to be famous from the footage, where staff member Angel Torres explains to them that he'll help set up the cameras, theorizing that the Haywoods might be in a UFO hotspot. Later on, he visits the ranch to do so, describing his perspective on aliens in the process. Em leaves momentarily and returns with a stolen display horse from Jupiter's Claim, intending to use it as bait. Jupe later arrives at the ranch to question Em about the display horse, but she bluffs her way out of it. Jupe attempts to invite the Haywoods to an event, but his flyer is taken away by the wind. He then leaves.This chapter is titled CLOVER.That night, the cameras and the decoy horse are set up. OJ notices that someone let another horse, Clover, out. He then encounters what seems to be multiple aliens. When one of them sneaks behind OJ, he punches it in the face - only to find out it's a child. The aliens are revealed to be Jupe's children, taunting him for stealing their decoy horse.Later, OJ goes to find Clover, but the UFO arrives and sucks up the decoy horse, which gets stuck, causing Clover to run away. Angel, secretly watching their cameras at Fry's, tells Em that the UFO is in the clouds, and Em shouts at OJ to run. OJ manages to hide safely, but witnesses Clover getting sucked up too. They fail to get the footage they need, as a praying mantis had blocked the view of a camera that stayed online, not affected by the UFO. Em tells OJ that they need to leave, but he tells her that there's more to this than they think and persuades her to stay and go on with the plan.The next day, Angel arrives at the ranch again, explaining that he rewinded through their footage and found a cloud that never moves, which might be the UFO's hiding place. Em contacts Antlers and tries to get him to join them, but he declines, claiming that they'd never wake up from this dream of being famous. OJ wonders if the UFO isn't a ship.This chapter is titled GORDY.The year is 1998. Young Jupe and his fellow actors act in an episode for the sitcom Gordy's Home titled Gordy's Birthday. During a scene where balloons are released in the room, the balloons start popping, shocking the chimp playing Gordy, who starts to go wild and attacks the human stars. Jupe hides under a table, sees a shoe standing up on its own (which he would later put on display in the future), and watches as fellow co-stars Mary Jo Elliot and Tom Bogan get attacked by the chimp, who calms down after finishing the attacks. The chimp notices Jupe and approaches him, using sign language to ask what happened to the family. The chimp reaches out his fist for the duo's iconic fist bump, but before their fists can touch, the chimp is shot dead.Back in the present, Jupe thinks about the massacre. His wife, Amber, motivates him to prepare for an upcoming event, and helps him recite his lines.This chapter is titled LUCKY.While Angel sets up tarps for a coming storm, OJ finds Jupe's flyer promoting the Star Lasso Experience. Deducing that this might involve Lucky, he heads to Jupiter's Claim to get Lucky back.Meanwhile, the Star Lasso Experience is starting. Jupe tells the audience about a night where he witnessed the UFO, and promises that they will leave different after witnessing a spectacle. The UFO arrives early. Jupe reveals a glass box that contains Lucky, meant to be sucked up for the show. Lucky refuses to walk out of the box, and the UFO appears above the audience, which include Mary Jo Elliot, whose face has been disfigured from the Gordy incident. The camera focuses on Jupe's shocked expression as the shadows behind him depict the audience being sucked up by the UFO.The inside of the UFO is shown, and it is revealed to be an alien itself, with the green square from the opening credits being its eye. Thus, Jupe, his family, and the audience are digested by the alien, while screams and the crunching of bones are heard in the background.OJ arrives at the empty Jupiter's Claim and finds Lucky, before the alien returns to try to suck him up and he gets knocked out by the bleachers of the arena. He wakes up at night and finds Lucky intact, before loading the horse into his truck and driving towards the ranch. He calls Em and warns her that the UFO is actually a predatory alien who sees the ranch and the area surrounding it as its territory, while Angel, about to leave the ranch, is forced to seek refuge in the house. The alien arrives above the Haywood house and vomits blood and debris, to Em and Angel's horror. OJ arrives at the house but his truck is shut down before he can reach it, and the alien goes above the truck and spits out the decoy horse.The next morning, OJ gets Em and Angel to flee in Angel's truck, and the alien arrives again. Recalling the earlier incident with Lucky on the commercial set, OJ doesn't look at the alien and manages to survive the encounter. The group gets away successfully and goes to Angel's apartment. That night, while eating dinner, OJ explains that the alien feels challenged when people look at it and then eats them. Meanwhile, Antlers listens to a news report about the disappearance of the Star Lasso Experience's audience and decides to join OJ, Em, and Angel.The next day, he visits their house and the group begins to plan. Antlers will bring a hand-cranked camera that won't be deactivated by the alien, now called Jean Jacket, the group will use tube man props to deduce where the alien is, Em will watch the area using cameras, and OJ will bait Jean Jacket.This chapter is titled JEAN JACKET.The next day comes and the plan is set into motion. However, Ryder Muybridge, a TMZ reporter, trespasses on the area and falls off his motorbike when Jean Jacket deactivates it. OJ attempts to save Ryder but is forced to leave him to die when Jean Jacket arrives. OJ successfully baits the alien, helping Antlers to capture footage. However, Antlers decides that the world doesn't deserve the footage, and lets himself get killed by Jean Jacket, destroying the footage in the process.After Em and Angel survive their encounters with Jean Jacket, it starts to unfold into a huge jellyfish-like form. After Em and OJ salute each other, the former uses Ryder's motorbike to drive towards Jupiter's Claim while the latter baits Jean Jacket away. Once reaching Jupiter's Claim, Em untethers the park's giant balloon mascot and uses the Winkin' Well, an attraction that uses an analog camera, to capture a photo of Jean Jacket as it eats the balloon mascot. The balloon and Jean Jacket explode, and after screaming in triumph, Em rests near the Winkin' Well.As reporters arrive, Em stands up, closes her eyes, and opens them again to see OJ riding Lucky, appearing from the fog. The film ends with a shot of the photograph of Jean Jacket.",The residents of a lonely gulch in inland California bear witness to an uncanny and chilling discovery.

While tracking deer she witnesses strange lights in the sky, which she believes to be a Thunderbird and a sign she is ready to become a hunter, but is actually a Predator dropship. Later, a member of the tribe is taken by a lion. Naru accompanies the search party, which retrieves the wounded man while Taabe stays behind to hunt the prey. Finding large, unusual tracks and a skinned rattlesnake, Naru circles back with Paake and reunites with Taabe. The three set a trap for the lion but it kills Paake.Naru faces off with the lion but is knocked unconscious when she is distracted by strange sounds and lights in the distance. She awakens at home, having been carried back by Taabe. He later returns to the village carrying the animal, earning him the title of War Chief. Convinced of a greater threat in the woods, Naru departs with her dog Sarii. She stumbles into a bog pit but narrowly escapes before being attacked by a grizzly bear. The bear corners her but is then killed by the Predator, giving Naru time to escape before running into a group of Comanche sent to find her. The Predator, which Naru calls a ""Mupitsi"" after Pia Mupitsi ('Mother owl') a monster in Comanche folklore,[4][5] ambushes and kills the men in combat, while Naru is caught in a foothold trap.French voyageurs find and cage Naru and Sarii. Their interpreter, Raphael Adolini, questions Naru about the Predator, whom the Frenchmen have encountered before. When she refuses to talk, the lead voyageur reveals that he has Taabe captive and tortures him before using both siblings as bait for the Predator, which the French are intent on capturing. The Predator kills most of the Frenchmen while Taabe and Naru escape. Naru rescues Sarii from the camp and stumbles across a dying Raphael, who teaches her how to use his flintlock pistol[a] in exchange for treatment for his severed leg. Naru gives him herbs that reduce his body heat to stanch the bleeding. When the Predator arrives, Raphael plays dead. Naru realizes that, due to his reduced heat, the Predator cannot see him. After it accidentally steps on Raphael, he screams and is killed.Taabe arrives on horseback to rescue Naru. Together they weaken the Predator, but it kills Taabe. Naru flees and finds the surviving lead Frenchman. She captures him and uses him as bait. Consuming the herbs to hide her body heat, she uses Raphael's pistol to ambush the Predator after it has killed the voyageur, knocking off its mask, which she knows is used to direct its spear gun. She steals the device and lures the Predator into the bog, where she positions the mask to face the pit. She battles the Predator, which becomes mired in the bog. It fires the spear gun at Naru and misses; the mask guides the projectile back to the Predator, killing it. Naru severs its head and paints her face with its glowing green blood. She returns with its head to her village, where she is declared the new War Chief. Naru informs her tribe that it is time for them to move.During the beginning of the closing credits, the narrative is summarized in a series of ledger art paintings that ends with a depiction of three Predator vessels descending towards the tribe.","Naru, a skilled warrior of the Comanche Nation, fights to protect her tribe against one of the first highly-evolved Predators to land on Earth."

A year later, Becky has given up climbing and become an alcoholic shut-in. She has estranged herself from her father, James, because he suggested that Dan was not the right man for her. Just before the anniversary of Dan's death, Hunter invites her to climb the decommissioned 2,000 foot (600 m) B-67 TV Tower in the desert, where she can scatter Dan's ashes as a form of healing. Becky refuses initially, then changes her mind and agrees to go, so that she can finally move on from Dan's death.The next day, Hunter and Becky arrive and successfully climb a severely corroded ladder to a tiny platform at the top of the tower, where Becky scatters the ashes, finally letting Dan go. As they begin their descent, however, the ladder breaks, stranding them several hundred feet above the next intact section and almost 2,000 feet above the ground. Moreover, the backpack with their water and a small Quadcopter drone has fallen onto a communications dish, just beyond the reach of their rope.Despite the remote location, Hunter is confident at first that emergency services will notice the crash of the ladder, but help never arrives. They try to use their cellphones but suspect that radio interference from the communications dish is blocking the signal. Hunter tries sending a message for help by packing her phone in one of her shoes and dropping it out of range of the interference, but the phone is destroyed upon impact with the ground before the message transmits.The pair later notice two men camping in an RV nearby and try to get their attention, but to no avail. They wait until dark and fire a flare gun they found in an emergency box on the pole. The men see it, but instead of helping them, they steal Hunter's vehicle and drive off.As the night falls, Becky notices a tattoo on Hunter's ankle: ""1-4-3,"" a numeric code Dan used to tell Becky that he loved her. Hunter tearfully admits to a four-month affair that ended shortly before Becky and Dan's wedding, but Becky is unmoved by her apologies. The next day, in penance, Hunter climbs to retrieve the backpack but nearly falls to her death. She injures her hand in the process, but successfully ties the rope to the bag, and Becky is forced to use all her remaining strength to pull both Hunter and the backpack up. Becky uses the tower's aviation obstruction lighting warning light to charge the drone and sends it to a nearby diner a few miles away with a written message for help, but it is struck by a truck and destroyed.At night, Becky is delirious from the lack of food and water, but in a brief lucid moment, when she asks Hunter for her shoe to pad it with her phone inside, Becky realizes Hunter had actually fallen onto one of the communication dishes and was killed; Becky has been hallucinating her presence since then. The next day, Becky is awakened by a vulture gnawing at her wounded leg and kills it to eat. Her strength partially restored, Becky climbs down to the dish where Hunter's body lies and types a text message to her father. She then puts the phone into Hunter's shoe for protection, shoves it into a hole in the corpse's abdomen, and pushes it off the tower. Hunter's body cushions the impact and the message transmits. Becky's father alerts emergency services, who then rush to the tower. She is rescued and reunited with her father.

This conflict is known as the Lapland War, and the German forces retaliate against the Finns. Retired commando and prospector Aatami Korpi lives alone with only his horse and his faithful dog in the remote wilderness of Lapland. Aatami spends his days panning and mining in search of gold. He sees battles taking place in the distance, but takes little interest in them. After uncovering a rich gold deposit, he collects a hefty amount of nuggets and mounts his horse, heading for the nearest town with his dog in tow. Along the way, Aatami encounters a 30-man Wehrmacht platoon led by ruthless SS Obersturmführer Bruno Helldorf and his subordinate Wolf, who are destroying settlements in their retreat and have taken several Finnish women captive. Helldorf takes little interest in Aatami, letting him pass. Aatami is soon accosted by a second group of soldiers who discover his saddlebags full of gold and prepare to execute him and his dog, but he swiftly kills them all. Alerted by the gunfire, Bruno investigates and discovers the carnage. He finds one of Aatami's gold nuggets, taken by one of the dying soldiers. Bruno and his tank pursue Aatami to the edge of a minefield, where Aatami's horse is killed by a landmine. Gathering up his gold, Aatami intentionally detonates another mine to make his escape. The soldiers sent after him are quickly claimed by the minefield. Two of the captive women are ordered ahead to ensure a clear path. One of the captives, Aino, volunteers to take the place of one of the women and leads the way. Retrieving Aatami's dog tag, Bruno learns that he was once a Finnish commando who lost his family and home fighting against the Red Army during the Winter War. Left with nothing, the vengeful Aatami became a legendary ""one-man death squad"" nicknamed Koschei, the ""Immortal"", who has killed hundreds of Communist troops. Bruno ignores the warning, defying orders to turn around and cease following Aatami. Wounded and exhausted, Aatami is awakened by the platoon's approach. With the soldiers' dogs on his trail, he hangs underneath one of the German vehicles and punctures the fuel tank, dousing himself in gasoline to hide his scent. When the platoon halts to inspect the leak, Aatami flees, holding the dogs at bay by lighting himself on fire before diving into a nearby lake. Waiting for him to surface, Bruno sends soldiers into the lake, but Aatami slits their throats underwater and breathes in the escaping air from their necks. Aatami reaches the other side of the lake, but Bruno finds his dog. Aatami discovers the town has been left in burning ruins by the Germans, and takes shelter in a petrol station. Bruno sends Aatami's dog to find his master, with a lit dynamite stick attached to his collar. Aatami saves the dog but is subdued by the explosion. Bruno, Wolf, and tank driver Schütze hang Aatami from the petrol station's sign, taking the gold and leaving him for dead, but Aatami hooks his wounds onto a protruding reinforcement bar, saving him from the noose but rendering him unconscious and still hanging from the rope. A pair of German pilots land in search of fuel and the wind from the plane loosens the petrol station's sign and cause Aatami to fall to the ground. The engineer in the plane notices Aatami is alive and the pilot orders him to kill Aatami and the dog. Aatami manages to kill the engineer and knocks the pilot unconscious. Unwilling to face the consequences of Germany's impending defeat, Bruno intends to use the gold to escape with Wolf and Schütze, arranging for a pilot to fly them to safety while the rest of the platoon makes their way to Norway. Meanwhile, Aatami forces the surviving pilot to fly him towards the platoon. Soon, the soldiers discover the airplane crashed in their path, with the pilot hanged by the same noose Wolf used on Aatami. As the convoy continues, Aatami climbs onto the truck holding the captured women, kills their guards, and arms the women. He and Aino commandeer one of the trucks, allowing him to leap onto Bruno's tank while the women gun down the rest of the soldiers in the other truck. Pulling Wolf out of the tank and beating him badly, Aatami leaves him at the mercy of the women and follows Bruno, who callously kills Schütze before taking off with the pilot. Aatami fires on the plane, mortally wounding the pilot, and uses his pickax to hack his way on-board in midair. After engaging in hand-to-hand combat, Bruno beats Aatami with a static line, subduing him. As Bruno is about to hit him again, Aatami swiftly hooks the static line to a bomb and releases the bomb through the bomb-bay door, dropping Bruno to his death. Finding the pilot also dead, Aatami straps himself in as the plane crashes into a large swamp. Led by Aino, the women deliver Wolf and the German tank to an incredulous Finnish unit. Remarkably still alive, Aatami crawls out of the swamp, reunites with his dog, and makes his way to war-ravaged Helsinki. Bloody and battered, Aatami enters a bank where he dumps his gold nuggets on the counter. The other customers are smartly dressed and look at him in wonderment. He finally speaks for the first time in the movie, asking the teller to exchange them for large bank notes, explaining they will not be as heavy to carry as the nuggets have been.","When an ex-soldier who discovers gold in the Lapland wilderness tries to take the loot into the city, German soldiers led by a brutal SS officer battle him."

It gave new life to the forest. The star has the legend of a single wish locked away in it, waiting to be granted.
While hosting a party in the town of Del Mar, legendary hero and outlaw Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) accidentally awakens a sleeping giant. He subdues the creature but is crushed by a bell. Waking up in a hospital, the town doctor (Anthony Mendez) informs him that he has lost eight of his nine lives and suggests Puss should retire. That night in a bar, Puss meets a black-hooded wolf (Wagner Moura), who disarms and wounds him in a sword-fight. Puss is not able to mount any resistance to the Wolf and is scared for the first time in his lifeTraumatized, Puss flees to the house of cat lady Mama Luna (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), where he buries his clothes and meets an optimistic Chihuahua disguised as a cat whom he calls Perrito (Harvey Guillén) (a friendly and naive therapy dog who started out as one of Mama Luna's pet cats). Puss is bored by the sedated lifestyle at Mama Luna's. He shares the place with many many other cats and has no identity left what-so-ever.Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her Three Bears Crime Family (Mama Bear (Olivia Colman), Papa Bear (Ray Winstone) & baby bear (Samson Kayo)) soon arrive at Luna's home. They plan to hire Puss to steal a map bearing the Wishing Star's location from pastry chef and crime boss ""Big"" Jack Horner (John Mulaney), but fail to recognize Puss in Boots and leave after finding his ""grave"" (where Puss had buried his clothes and sword). Puus overhears Goldi talking about the map to the Wishing Star and that the map will be with Big Jack Horner.
Horner, a feared pastry chef and crime lord who plans to use the Wishing Star to gain control of all magicPuss decides to use the Star to restore his lost lives. Accompanied by Perrito, he breaks into Horner's bakery to steal the map, but is interrupted by his resentful ex-fiance Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) (a street-savvy Tuxedo cat who is Puss' ex-fiance, and seeks the Wishing Star to find somebody she can trust), Horner, and Goldi and the bears. Puss manages to escape with the map alongside Kitty and Perrito, though he sees the wolf threaten him while fleeing.The map leads the trio to the Dark Forest, a pocket dimension that changes its landscape depending on the map's holder. Puss and Kitty get the path with the most deadly obstacles, but Perrito's path is littered with rainbows and rivers of relaxation. Puss and Kitty hand the map to Perrito.
Meanwhile the bears, Goldi and Horner are in pursuit of the trio.
At the Pocket Full of Posies, giant roses block their path. Perrito gets them through by simply smelling the roses. Horner follows and uses his Phoenix to burn the entire rose meadow down.During another clash with Horner, his henchmen, and Goldi and the bears, Puss sees the wolf again and runs off, distracting Kitty and allowing Goldi to obtain the map. After Perrito calms Puss' panic attack, Puss confesses to being on his last life, and his remorse for leaving Kitty on their wedding day. Kitty overhears them and reveals that she never attended the wedding either, believing Puss could not love anyone more than himself.Puss and Kitty steal back the map while Goldi and the bears are distracted by a manifestation of their woodland cottage where Goldi and the bears first met (Goldi's path went through Nostalgic Pines). As the dimension shifts, Puss accidentally traps himself in a crystalline cave (In the Caves of Lost Souls), where he encounters his arrogant past lives, and the wolf, who reveals himself as Death. The black hooded wolf is initially presumed to be a bounty hunter. He wants to personally kill Puss as punishment for Puss wasting eight of his nine lives. He wields twin sickles that combine into a double-bladed weapon.Feeling disrespected by Puss not valuing his extra lives, Death wants to take Puss' final life prematurely. Horrified, Puss runs out of the cave towards the Star alone, ignoring Kitty and Perrito's pleas for him to stop. Kitty feels that Puss has again betrayed her.
Meanwhile, Goldi reveals to the bears that her wish is to be reunited with her biological family; although they are devastated, the bears agree to help her.Puss arrives at the Star and begins to make his wish using the map, but is confronted by Kitty, who berates him for his selfishness and confesses that her wish was to find someone she could trust. Goldi, the bears, and Horner arrive, and a fight ensues for the map; Goldi briefly obtains the map, but abandons it to save Baby Bear, while Kitty traps Horner inside his magical bottomless bag.
Death mounts the Star and challenges Puss. Having learned the value of life from his time with his companions, Puss forgoes wishing for more lives and accepts Death's duel. Puss disarms the wolf, and declares that while he knows he can never defeat Death, he will never stop fighting for his last life. Seeing that Puss has lost his arrogance, Death begrudgingly spares him. Before leaving, Death and Puss agree they will meet again one day.Horner eats a magic snack inside the bag, which makes him gigantic and allows him to escape. He attempts to make his wish to control all of the world's magic for himself, but Perrito distracts him long enough for Puss, Kitty, and Goldi to destroy the map, causing the Star to collapse and consume Horner. In the aftermath, Goldi affirms to the bears that they are her true family, and they leave to take over Horner's bakery.

After enslaving his people and forcing them to dig for ""Eternium"" - the magical crystal needed to create the crown - a young boy leads the slaves to revolt against him. When the boy is given the power of Shazam, transforming him into Kahndaq's heroic champion Teth-Adam, he kills Anh-Kot and ends his reign.In the present day, Khandaq is oppressed by the Intergang. Archaeologist Adrianna Tomaz tries to locate the Crown of Sabbac, with the help of her brother Karim, and colleagues, Samir and Ishmael. As Adrianna obtains the crown, they are ambushed by the Intergang, killing Samir in the process. Adrianna accidentally reads an incantation which awakens Adam from his slumber, who subsequently slaughters most of the Intergang troops. After an Intergang soldier shoots an Eternium rocket at Adam which renders him comatose, it is revealed that Ishmael is an Intergang member who intends to take the crown for himself.Government official Amanda Waller learns of the incident and contacts Carter Hall / Hawkman to assist in taking Adam into custody. Hawkman is accompanied by his fellow members of the Justice Society of America (consisting of Kent Nelson / Doctor Fate, Maxine Hunkel / Cyclone, and Albert ""Al"" Rothstein / Atom Smasher) to stop Adam.Adrianna sees an inscription on an inner part of the Crown which states ""Life is the only way to Death"". Adrianna's son Amon sees Adam as Khandaq's hero, but Adam denies it and departs. Wanting to prove to Kahndaq that their champion has reawakened, Amon makes a ruckus with the Intergang, successfully leading Adam to intervene and overpower them. The JSA arrive in time to stop Adam from doing further destruction. As they fight, Fate senses that Adrianna has the Crown of Sabbac. They manage to stop Adam for a while before he flees to the ruins of Anh-Kot's palace. The JSA ask Adrianna to give them the crown, but she declines until they tell her the truth that Adam was the one who lost control of his power five thousand years ago and destroyed most of Khandaq.The crown is given to Amon, who takes it back home. Ishmael is there with Karim, and reveals his true colors. Amon runs away from Ishmael, who shoots and wounds Karim, and chases Amon. Meanwhile, Adrianna and the JSA meet Adam, and attempt to convince him that he can be a hero to Khandaq, before Amon calls Adrianna, who pleads to Adam to save him. Adam immediately comes to the rescue, but Ishmael manages to abduct Amon and flees on an Eternium bike. Adam tries to rescue Amon by dealing with the Intergang on bikes to no avail. As Adam goes back to Adrianna's home, Hawkman manages to capture two Intergang members and interrogate them about their hideout. Adam uses brute force to interrogate both of them and learns where the Intergang's hideout is, but his way of interrogation enrages Hawkman. As Adam and Hawkman fight, they find that Amon hid the Crown of Sabbac in plain sight. They intend to use the Crown to trade with Amon and must fight side by side to save him. On their way, Fate reveals to Hawkman of his premonition about Hawkman's death.They reach Ishmael, who reveals that he is the last descendant of King Anh-Kot and, wanting his rightful place in the throne, demands the crown, which Adrianna willingly gives to save Amon's life. Unfortunately, Ishmael betrays his part of the deal by shooting Amon and putting the crown on himself. As Adam tries to save Amon, he loses control again and destroys the hideout with his power, until the JSA protects Amon and Adrianna as Ishmael dies in the process.Guilt-ridden, Adam flees to the ruins again. There, he reveals to Hawkman that it was actually Hurut, his son, who was Khandaq's champion; knowing that Hurut was invincible, the king's men executed Hurut's family instead, killing Isis and mortally wounding Adam in the process. Hurut gave his power to Adam to save him, but Anh-Kot's archer managed to kill the now-powerless Hurut. Enraged, Adam slaughtered all of the king's men, before he was summoned by the wizards of Shazam, who imprisoned him after deeming him unworthy. Feeling incapable of becoming Khandaq's champion and protecting it, Adam then surrenders to the JSA, who take him to Waller's underwater prison. Soon after, Fate continues to see the ominous premonition. It is later revealed that Ishmael intentionally made Adam kill him so that he can be reborn as Sabbac, which he succeeds in doing so, and arises from the underworld to Khandaq to claim his throne.The JSA arrive in time trying to stop Sabbac, who summons the undead to Khandaq. Adrianna and Amon fight them, with Karim joining them. Amon asks for the people of Khandaq to fight together against the undead for Kahndaq's freedom.The JSA prepare to face Sabbac in Anh-Kot's ruins. However, Fate creates a magical force field which forbids Hawkman, Cyclone and Atom Smasher from coming into the ruins, and reveals that Hawkman's death can be avoided, with Fate's sacrifice. Fate then fights Sabbac alone, and at the same time uses astral projection to release Adam from his suspended animation so Adam can help them. Adam manages to escape the prison, but Sabbac kills Fate. Fate's death causes the force field to disappear, allowing Hawkman, Cyclone and Atom Smasher try to fight Sabbac, who overpowers them. Just as he is about to kill the JSA, Adam arrives, and engages Sabbac, but is slowly losing as Sabbac's power can harm him. Hawkman uses Fate's helmet to create magical duplicates and spells, having learned from Fate, to help Adam kill Sabbac, ultimately stopping the undead.The JSA depart on good terms with Adam, who accepts his new role as protector of Khandaq rather than its ruler.

Marisol is constantly in Otto's life. A few days later she finds a frozen cat in her driveway and brings it to Otto's home to revive it.Otto has a flashback to his graduation when he asked Sonya to marry him. During a suicide attempt by train, an old man faints and falls forward onto the railroad tracks. Otto saves the man and the incident goes viral and he is saved from an oncoming train by someone taking his hand from the platform and pulling him out of the tracks.
Marisol wants Otto to give her driving lessons, but he refuses. Marisol gets the lessons from another neighbors who teaches her all wrong, prompting Otto to take charge of her driving instructions. Marisol has only ever driven automatic, but Otto insists that she learns to drive stick.Marisol asks Otto if he'd take her for a driving lesson and later they visit Sonya's favorite bakery, which the couple formerly frequented every weekend. Otto adopts a cat that keeps hanging about outside. At the bakery, he tells her about his friendship with a man named Reuben (Peter Lawson Jones), the two having worked together to establish rules and order, with Otto as chairman of the neighborhood association board. The two grew apart after Reuben's preference for Fords and Toyotas over Otto's Chevrolets and the ""coup"" of replacing Otto as chairman. Reuben, who had a stroke, now uses a wheelchair and is cared for by his wife Anita (Juanita Jennings) and neighbor Jimmy (Cameron Britton).A local transgender teen, Malcolm (Mack Bayda), recognizes Otto as Sonya's husband while delivering newspapers and circulars in the neighborhood. Malcolm cuts through Otto's disgruntlement at receipt of the newspapers and recounts that Sonya was his teacher, and one of the few people who accepted him as he was. A friendship forms between the pair and Otto fixes Malcolm's bicycle. After dodging a social media journalist named Shari Kenzie (Kelly Lamor Wilson) who is attempting to interview him in relation to the earlier viral video, Otto gets angry at both Marisol and a Dye & Merika real estate agent (Mike Birbiglia) (who always leaves the gates open and doesn't follow the rules of the society), not wanting to come to terms with Sonya's death. While chasing the agent away, Otto gets agitated and out of breath, but wont tell Marisol anything and shuts her out. He attempts to commit suicide by shotgun, but is interrupted by Malcolm, who asks to spend the night after his father kicked him out.Otto learns that Dye & Merika is planning to force Reuben into a nursing home and take their house, after illegally finding out (By calling their son Chris who had the power of attorney) that Anita was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. So, Reuben has to move into a special needs place and ANita into a retirement home. This way the real estate company gets the house if Chris agrees to sell to them, which he does.
Otto agrees to help Anita and Reuben. Marisol refuses to assist Otto (she is angry with him about shutting her out) until he tells her that he and Sonya went to Niagara Falls to celebrate Sonya's pregnancy. On the bus back home, they were involved in a crash, and Sonya became paralyzed and had a miscarriage. The neighborhood was not accessible to Sonya and Otto was voted out of the chairmanship after a heated confrontation with a Dye & Merika representative (David Magee) (who were building condos all around the society and none of it was wheelchair friendly). Otto wanted to put all of the real estate companies out of business (and wanted to sue the bus company who had a recall on the brakes of the bus, but never got it fixed) but decided against it to care for Sonya. With the help of the neighborhood and Shari Kenzie (Who questions the rep on how he has access to medical records of seniors), Reuben and Anita are able to keep their home.Otto collapses and is taken to the hospital, where he lists Marisol as his next of kin. After being told by a cardiologist that Otto's heart is too big, she laughs, before going into labor and gives birth to a son.
One day, Tommy notices that Otto did not shovel the snow on his walkway (which he did every single day of his life). Marisol and Tommy enter Otto's house to find him dead, having succumbed to his enlarged heart. A funeral is held, attended by his neighbors. In a letter to Marisol, Otto says that his lawyer will give her his bank accounts, providing them with enough money to take care of her family, along with his new car and house.","Otto is a grump who's given up on life following the loss of his wife and wants to end it all. When a young family moves in nearby, he meets his match in quick-witted Marisol, leading to a friendship that will turn his world around."

Danny need Will as a driver, since Will is an excellent driver and can drive anything.
Though initially hesitant, Will agrees after Danny reaffirms that he is doing this for Amy. The plan nearly succeeds until Officer Zach (Jackson White), who goes to the bank to ask out a bank teller, discovers the situation and is held hostage by Danny. The money is stuffed into 4 bags, which means $8 million per bag.
A shootout then occurs between one of the heist members and Zach's partner Officer Mark (Cedric Sanders).The Special Investigation Section (SIS) of the LAPD arrives and shoots down the whole crew except Will and Danny, who retreat towards the garage. The SIS was tracking Danny and his crew from the beginning but were late to the scene as Danny did not use the vehicle that the SIS had put a tracker on. Will and Danny escape with 1 bag each.
Zach attempts to escape and during a scuffle between him and Danny, he is accidentally shot by Will. Will wants to stop and help Zach, but Danny forces Will to leave Zach and run.
Mark finds Zach and calls in an Ambulance.Leaving Zach to die, the brothers attempt to exit through the back of the building but find it surrounded by police. They then hijack an ambulance with EMT Cam Thompson (Eiza González) on board, who is treating the injured Zach. Cam is known to be the best paramedic in town who can keep anyone alive for 20 minutes. But she has no friends.
Cam is held hostage by Danny. Danny forces Cam to convince the SIS team to let them through the barricade as she has a dying cop inside the ambulance. Meanwhile Mark finds the injured Ambulance driver and realizes that it has been hijacked.
After a chase that leads them into an alleyway, Cam makes a desperate attempt to escape using a fire extinguisher but is quickly recaptured by Danny.SIS Captain Monroe (Garret Dillahunt) arrives on the scene and deploys helicopters to chase after the ambulance. Danny tells Will to keep driving towards their back up car location. Cam gets Danny to help her use a defibrillator and Will to transfer some of his blood to Zach, much to his confusion and frustration. Danny wants to keep Zach alive, as he knows that killing a cop would lead to dire consequences for him.
Meanwhile Monroe orders using electronic sniping to figure out the communication units on board the ambulance. They find a satellite phone and police scanners on board.
Danny then calls Papi (A Martinez), one of his father's criminal friends, for help losing the police in exchange for $8 million. Papi and his son Roberto start to outfit a car with heavy ammunition.When Cam stops Danny from shooting Mark, who has been chasing them, Danny threatens to throw her off the ambulance.
The police are forced to retreat when it is discovered that Monroe's dog is inside Mark's police vehicle. FBI Agent Anson Clark (Keir O'Donnell), a past friend of Danny's, is put on the case. Clark says that Danny has been robbing banks since he was 17 years old. And his father is a known psychotic. Clark says that Danny is looking for a way out since he did not kill the cop.
Will tells Danny not to hurt Cam.Zach begins to bleed out; Cam, with Will's assistance, begins to perform surgery on Zach. Despite her inexperience and a ruptured spleen, Cam successfully performs the surgery with advise on phone from doctors who are specialists at this. Danny had taken over the driving as Will helped Cam. Cam tries to convince Will to stop Danny, to no avail. Will tells Cam that he will get her out alive. The phone line to the doctors got cut due to low battery as Zach's spleen burst while being taken out. In that scenario a patient has 60 seconds to live. Cam was able to block the artery with a clamp, but the doctors didn't know that.
Monroe, unaware of the surgery's success, moves forward with the operation and prepares to snipe Will and Danny without negotiating for Cam's life.Clark calls Cam, on Zach's phone which was still on his person inside the ambulance and tells her to get down. Cam, wanting to save Zach's life, alerts Will and Danny about the snipers. Danny, having had enough of Cam, decides to shoot her but Will intervenes, causing the brothers to fight about their predicament. They later partially reconcile and listen to music together to ease the tension.In the Los Angeles River, helicopters chase the ambulance as Danny shoots at them. Will and Danny then drive on the opposite lane of the interstate, creating multiple accidents. Danny hides his ambulance under a bridge, where it is painted blue by Papi's men. Danny says that this is Will's window to walk away, but Will refuses to go. He won't leave Danny. Cam learns that Will has a daughter and that his wife has cancer and needs the money for her surgery.
From under the bridge, many ambulances are driven away in different directions, to confuse Monroe's teams.On Papi's orders, his son, Roberto (Jesse Garcia), drives an empty ambulance towards the police after filling it with C-4 explosives and deploys machine guns on separate cars to cause additional damage, which ends up wounding Monroe in the crossfire. Mark had seen Roberto escape after jumping out of the loaded ambulance and gives chase.Mark chases down Roberto and fatally shoots him after a scuffle, leaving Papi angry and distraught. Will and Danny escape to Papi's hideout. Papi demands the brothers to leave Zach and Cam with them to deal with; Will refuses to cooperate and teams up with Danny to kill Papi and his crew. In the ambulance, Zach regains consciousness and gives his Partner's gun to Cam.In the chaos, Cam accidentally shoots Will using Zach's gun. Danny puts Will into the Ambulance. Will takes a bundle of cash and gives it to Cam, begging her to give it to his wife. Danny takes the ambulance to a hospital and discovers Zach's gun. He is enraged when Cam reveals that she was the one who shot Will. Danny says that Will was the one who saved Zach and Cam. Danny vows to kill Cam along with himself on live television, before confronting the police.Will, left with no other choice, shoots Danny in the back. Danny apologizes to Will before he dies from his injuries. The police arrest a heavily injured Will and take him inside for surgery after Cam says that he saved Zach's life.

When she wakes up in the middle of the night, she is shaken to find her bedroom door has been opened, but Keith is asleep and assures her he did not touch the door.Tess goes for her interview the next morning and is cautioned to stay on guard while in the neighbourhood around the house, which is suffering from heavy urban decay. Returning to the house, she is chased inside by a homeless man who yells at her to leave.

Tess and AJ then take shelter with Andre.Andre explains that the Mother is a product of Frank's multi-generational incest with his victims. The Mother bursts in, kills Andre by ripping his arm off and beating him to death with it and chases Tess and AJ up a water tower. AJ loses his gun and pushes Tess off the water tower to save himself. The Mother jumps after her and shields her from the fall.

They travel to Berlin, Germany where Yusuf is planted as a spy in Grindelwald's inner circle. Grindelwald has his convert, Queenie Goldstein, use legilimency to test Yusuf's trustworthiness. The International Confederation of Wizards (ICW) acquits Grindelwald of all previous criminal charges, allowing for his candidacy as Supreme Mugwump of the ICW, despite Dumbledore's attempts to otherwise persuade current Supreme Mugwump Anton Vogel.Meanwhile, Grindelwald's acolytes, who have undermined the German Ministry of Magic, arrest Theseus and plot to assassinate the Brazilian Supreme Mugwump candidate, Vicência Santos.

That Strange is killed and Chavez accidentally creates a portal that transports herself and Strange's corpse to Earth-616, where that universe's version of Strange rescues Chavez from another demon with help from the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong (Benedict Wong) (The Sorcerer Supreme of Earth-616 and Strange's mentor and friend). Chavez explains that the beings are hunting her because she has the power to travel through the multiverse. She cant control her powers and it manifests only when she is really frightened.
Chavez says that the other Strange reached the book of Vishanti (which would give him the powers to defeat the demon), but that's when the Demon caught up with them and killed Strange. Chavez shows them the dead Strange's corpse as proof.Recognizing witchcraft runes, Strange consults Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) (A former Avenger gone rogue who can harness chaos magic, engage in telepathy and telekinesis, and alter reality) for help but realizes that she is responsible for the attacks. After acquiring the Darkhold (the book of the damned that corrupts everyone) and becoming the Scarlet Witch, Maximoff believes that controlling Chavez's powers will allow her to reunite (by travelling to a different Universe, where they are still alive) with Billy (Julian Hilliard) and Tommy (Jett Klyne), the children she created during her time in Westview.Maximoff gives an ultimatum to surrender Chavez by sundown. When Strange refuses to surrender Chavez, Maximoff attacks Kamar-Taj, killing many sorcerers. Under stress, Chavez accidentally transports herself and Strange to Earth-838 (from where she cant go back as she cant control her powers. CHavez herself doesn't have a counterpart in any other universe) while Maximoff uses the Darkhold to ""dream-walk"" (Projecting her consciousness into her alternate from any other Universe), taking control of her Earth-838 counterpart, who lives a suburban life with her own Billy and Tommy. A surviving sorceress sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold and break the dream-walk. Enraged, Maximoff forces Wong to lead her to Mount Wundagore, the source of the Darkhold's power, to reestablish the dream-walk.
There Maximoff realizes that Wundagore is a throne that has been waiting for her arrival. She was meant to rule all the multiverses.While searching for help, Strange and Chavez are apprehended by Earth-838's Sorcerer Supreme, Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) (In this Universe Strange died trying to protect the Earth from Thanos), and brought before the Illuminati, a group consisting of Mordo, Peggy Carter / Captain Carter (Hayley Atwell), Blackagar Boltagon / Black Bolt (Anson Mount), Maria Rambeau / Captain Marvel (Lashana Lynch), Reed Richards (John Krasinski) (A member of the Fantastic 4), and Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart).
They explain that through reckless use of their universe's Darkhold in an attempt to defeat Thanos, Earth-838's Strange triggered a universe-destroying ""incursion"" (when boundaries between 2 universes are blurred, they collide, destroying one of both of the universes). After defeating Thanos (They found the book of Vishanti and used its powers to kill Thanos), the Illuminati executed their Strange to prevent him from causing more harm.Mordo believes that Earth-616's Strange is similarly dangerous, but Maximoff reestablishes her dream-walk at Mount Wundagore and arrives in her Earth-838 counterpart's body before they can pass judgment. She kills all of the Illuminati except Mordo, whom Strange subdues before fleeing with Chavez. The two escape with help from the Earth-838 counterpart of Strange's ex-fiance, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) (An emergency surgeon who was a colleague and lover of Strange), a scientist working with the Illuminati. Before dying Xavier had told Strange that 838 had the book of Vishanti. Strange convinces Palmer to take him to the way-point that leads to the book of Vishanti.Strange, Chavez and Palmer enter the space between universes to find the Book of Vishanti, which is the antithesis to the Darkhold, but Maximoff appears and destroys it. She then takes over Chavez's mind, using her powers to send the others to an incursion-destroyed universe. She also uses Chavez to send her back to Earth 616, where Maximoff disconnects the dream-walk with her 838 self.Strange defeats the destroyed universe's Strange, who has been corrupted by his universe's Darkhold, and uses it to dream-walk into the body of his deceased counterpart on Earth-616. With Wong's help, Strange saves Chavez from Maximoff as she tries to take Chavez's powers, and encourages Chavez to use her abilities. She transports Maximoff to Earth-838, where she sees Billy and Tommy recoil from her (the Wanda 616 who was in SCarlett witch headgear) in fear while crying for their real mother (whom Wanda 616 tossed aside when she entered the 616 universe). Realizing the error of her ways, Maximoff-616 relents and uses her powers to bring down Mount Wundagore, simultaneously destroying all copies of the Darkhold throughout the multiverse and apparently sacrificing herself in the process. Chavez returns Strange and Palmer to their respective universes.Sometime later, Kamar-Taj is repaired and the surviving sorcerers, joined by Chavez, continue training.

His relationship with his ex-wife Olivia (Sharon Horgan) and daughter Addy (Lily Sheen) is also marred by years of emotional neglect. Following an embarrassing and humiliating event (Cage gets drunk, sings a bad song to take out his own frustration at his own failures) at Addy's birthday party and losing a key film role, Cage plans to retire from acting. He decides to accept a vague offer of $1 million from his agent Richard Fink (Neil Patrick Harris) that involves going to Majorca to meet billionaire playboy Javi Gutierrez (Pedro Pascal) and to be the guest of honor at his birthday. Cage is forced to accept the offer as he has alimony and has substantial debts to pay off due to his lavish lifestyle.Upon meeting Javi, Cage is initially annoyed by his neediness and insistence that they create an improvisational movie based on a script he wrote, but is soon inspired by Javi's determination, and the two of them quickly bond over their surprisingly shared love of films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Paddington 2 (the latter of which Cage watches for the first time with Javi).
Soon after, Cage is confronted by CIA agents Vivian (Tiffany Haddish) and Martin (Ike Barinholtz). They suspect that Javi, who they claim made his fortune through arms dealing, is behind the kidnapping of Maria (Katrin Vankova), the daughter of a Catalan anti-crime politician, with the hope that he will drop out of an upcoming election. Despite his insistence otherwise, Cage decides to help the CIA with the mission. Although Cage insists that yrs of being an actor has given him an ability to read people and his guts tells him that Javi is not an arms dealer.After successfully rigging the cameras in Javi's compound, Cage attends a party where he announces his collaboration with Javi on a new movie, as an excuse to stay on the compound long enough to find Maria (Martin and Vivian tell Cage that they suspect Javi of having imprisoned Maria on his compound). After a misadventure involving LSD (Cage and Javi trip out and imagine that they both are being watched. They try to ""run away"" from the spies and share a moment when they help each other climb a wall), Cage discovers that Javi keeps a shrine room dedicated to all of his movies, including a wax figure of his character Castor Troy from the film Face/Off, complete with identical golden guns. Cage finds it difficult to betray Javi, but Vivian convinces him to work the kidnapping into their script so that he could potentially reveal where Maria is.Cage explains his new idea to Javi, who believes that Cage is creatively bankrupt, and possibly has issues he needs to work out. Javi brings Olivia and Addy to his villa from Los Angeles; they are frightened and angered over what is happening. Cage tries to make amends with them, but they reject his appeal and accuse him of prioritizing his film career over his family. Javi privately goes to meet with his cousin Lucas (Paco León), who is revealed to be the true arms dealer and the one who kidnapped Maria. Lucas warns him that Cage is working with the CIA and pressures him to kill Cage, or else Lucas will kill Javi. Cage begins to rethink his friendship since Javi flew in his wife and daughter. Meanwhile Lucas plays Cage's recordings to prove to Javi that Cage is working for the CIA. Lucas tells Javi to kill Cage.Cage and Javi have a stand-off with each other, but neither can bring themselves to kill the other. Lucas sends his men after both of them, and they race back to the house to discover that Addy has been kidnapped. Cage takes Javi, Olivia and Javi's assistant Gabriela (Alessandra Mastronardi) to the CIA safe house, only for the house to have been compromised; Martin has been killed, while Vivian sacrifices herself to kill Lucas's men before they can ambush the group. With Javi's help, Cage and Olivia pose as a reclusive criminal couple (The head of a rival crime family in Majorca, who have not been seen for 15 yrs.

However, Cage, Addy, Maria and Olivia escape while Javi and Gabriela stay behind to distract Lucas.Cage, Addy, Olivia and Maria race to the American embassy with Lucas still in pursuit. Upon arrival, Lucas holds Cage at gunpoint, but Addy tosses him a knife which Cage uses to kill him-transitioning into the movie that Cage and Javi completed, presumably based on their adventure. Cage is applauded for his new film and congratulates Javi before going home with his family to watch Paddington 2, now with a better relationship.",Moviestar Nick Cage is channeling his iconic characters as he's caught between a superfan and a CIA agent.

They listen to a patriotic speech by a school official and unknowingly receive uniforms from soldiers killed in a previous battle. After they are deployed in Northern France near La Malmaison, they are befriended by Stanislaus ""Kat"" Katczinsky, an older soldier. Their romantic view of the war is shattered by the realities of trench warfare on the Western Front, and Ludwig is killed by artillery on the first night.On November 7, 1918, German official Matthias Erzberger, weary of mounting losses, meets with German High Command to persuade them to begin armistice talks with the Allied powers. Meanwhile, Paul and Kat steal a goose from a farm to share with Albert, Franz, and another veteran, Tjaden Stackfleet, with whom they have grown close behind the front in Champagne. Kat, who is illiterate, gets Paul to read him a letter from his wife and worries that he cannot reintegrate into peacetime society. Franz spends the night with a French woman and brings back her scarf as a souvenir.On the morning of November 9, General Friedrichs drives Erzberger and the German delegation to a train bound for the Forest of Compiègne to negotiate a ceasefire. Paul and his friends go on a mission to find 60 missing recruits sent to reinforce their unit and discover that they were killed by gas after taking off their masks too soon. Friedrichs, who opposes the talks, orders an attack before French reinforcements arrive. That night, Erzberger's delegation reaches the Forest of Compiègne, and Paul's regiment is sent to the front to prepare to attack the French lines.On the morning of November 10, Ferdinand Foch, the Supreme Allied Commander, gives 72 hours for the Germans to accept the Allied terms, with no room for negotiation. Meanwhile, the German attack takes the French front line after hand-to-hand fighting but is routed by a combined arms counterattack with Saint-Chamond tanks, airplanes, and flamethrowers. Franz is separated from the group, and Albert is killed trying to surrender. Trapped in a crater in no man's land with a French soldier, Paul stabs him and watches him die slowly, becoming remorseful and asking forgiveness to his dead body. Erzberger learns of Kaiser Wilhelm II's abdication and receives instructions in the evening from field marshal Paul von Hindenburg to accept the Allied terms. Paul returns to his unit and sees them celebrating the imminent end of the war. He finds a wounded Tjaden, who gives him Franz's scarf. Paul and Kat bring him food but Tjaden, distraught at being crippled, kills himself.Around 5:00 AM on November 11, Erzberger's delegation signs the armistice set to take effect at 11 AM. After learning of the ceasefire, Paul and Kat steal from the farm one last time, but Kat is shot by the farmer's young son and dies as Paul carries him to the hospital. Friedrichs wants to end the war with a German victory and orders an attack to start at 10:45. A despondent, battle-hardened Paul kills many French soldiers before being speared through the chest by a bayonet seconds before 11:00 when the fighting stops, and the front falls silent. A short time later, a newly arrived German recruit that Paul had saved in the combat finds Paul's mud-caked body and retrieves Franz's scarf that was passed on to Paul from Tjaden.",A young German soldier's terrifying experiences and distress on the western front during World War I.

Roy's son and second-in-command, Richie (Dylan O'Brien), and his chief enforcer, Francis (Johnny Flynn), use Leonard's shop as a stash house for dirty money; Leonard tolerates this arrangement as the Boyles and their men are his best customers. Leonard also shares a complicated relationship with shop receptionist Mable (Zoey Deutch), who is also Richie's girlfriend.
Mable yearns to get out of this life in Chicago, which is controlled by the mob. Mable wants to travel the world. Mable is clear that she will never train to become a tailor like Leonard or take over the shop like he wants.
Mable says that she has been around men like Richie all her life. She says that the best way to deal with them is to let them know that you are one of them.Richie dislikes Francis as Francis has the ear of Richie's father Roy.
One night, Francis shows up at the shop with Richie, who's been shot in the belly after a confrontation with the rival LaFontaine family. Leonard is forced at gunpoint to treat Richie's wounds and hide a briefcase containing a copy of an FBI recording with detailed information on the crew's operations, which was provided by ""The Outfit"", a nationwide syndicate founded by Al Capone. Francis gets in touch with Roy and departs, leaving Leonard and Richie alone. Richie believes that there is a rat in their organization, as the LaFontaines seem to know their every move, and believes that the recording will reveal the rat's identity. Leonard suggests to Richie that Francis is the rat.
Leonard says that he used to apprentice for years at a tailor shop in London and learned his craft. He came to Chicago, as London was poor after the first world war and people could not afford the nice things in life, like the suits he stitches. Due to poverty, people took to cheap blue jeans, which became all the rage.When Francis returns, Leonard intercepts him, claiming that Richie is light-headed and delusional from blood loss. Leonard says that Richie is fiddling with the tape and wants to know who the rat is. Francis meets Richie and says that he found a hi-tech guy who can play the tape. Francis wants to take the tape and play it to figure out who the rat is.
Leonard had already convinced Richie that if Francis has the tape, he could paint anybody as the rat, even if Francis himself was the rat.Richie wants Francis to wait till Roy gets to the shop. Francis insists that he wants to identify the rat immediately. They both struggle for the briefcase and it falls open, revealing that there was no tape inside it. Both believe the other took it.
Richie threatens Francis, who kills him. He and Leonard hide Richie's body just as Roy arrives with his bodyguard Monk (Alan Mehdizadeh). The two men lie and tell Roy that Richie left the store on his own and took the tape with him; Francis volunteers to go find him.
Roy starts chatting with Leonard and tells him that The Outfit is like the United Nations of the underworld. After Al Capone's death it became a network and worked to protect its members. The Outfit is considering Roy and his organization for membership. To complete the process, Roy needs to destroy the LaFontaines. That tape was provided by The Outfit to help Roy find the rat in his organization. If the tape gets out, their chances of joining The Outfit will come crashing down.
The tape was made by the FBI by placing a recording device inside a hidden location and the Outfit was able to get a copy of it through their contacts.Roy notices Richie's coat in the store's backroom and threatens Leonard. Leonard says that Richie went out threatening to kill LaFontaine.
Francis then returns with Mable in tow, claiming that he found Richie's blood in her apartment and suggesting that she is the rat. When Roy orders his men to torture her for information, Leonard distracts him by revealing the reason why he came to Chicago: his wife and daughter were killed in a fire at his former shop and home on Savile Row.The shop's phone rings and Leonard answers it; he lies that the call was from Richie, who is waiting for Roy. Roy and Monk depart but Francis insists on staying. Leonard convinces Francis to betray Roy by using Mable, who really is the rat and has been selling information to LaFontaine and the FBI. Mable had hoped that Roy and the LaFontaines would kill each other and she would be able to get away from Richie. Leonard tells Francis that he stole the tape and hid it.
Roy's death at LaFontaine's hands will allow Francis to take over Roy's business. At Leonard's urging, Mable calls Violet LaFontaine (Nikki Amuka-Bird) to give her Roy's location and offer to sell her the recording. Francis hides at the back of the store when Violet arrives, intending to kill her, but Leonard warns Violet and her bodyguards shoot Francis twice instead. Mable takes the payment, and Violet leaves with the tape.It is revealed that the night's events played out due to Leonard's manipulation. Leonard has been deceiving the Boyles by planting fake messages from The Outfit, and knew that Mable has allowed the FBI to place a bug in his store. The recording Violet took was a fake; the real one is still in the store and has been recording the night's conversations, capturing enough information to convict any remaining Boyles as well as LaFontaine. Leonard gives Mable the real tape to send to the FBI and urges her to use LaFontaine's money to live her dreams.Intending to start over again, Leonard douses the store with flammable liquid and lights it with a match, but is interrupted when Francis gets up and tries to kill him. Leonard tells Francis that he used to be a gang enforcer like Francis, but left when he was ordered to commit a heinous crime. Fleeing from his gang, he reinvented himself and started a family, until his old gang found them and burned down his shop, killing his wife and daughter. Leonard fatally stabs Francis in the neck with his prized fabric shears. Wearing a dark jacket to hide his wounds, he quietly leaves the store as it burns.",An expert cutter must outwit a dangerous group of mobsters in order to survive a fateful night.

Sidney asks Sam to help stop the killer, but Sam declines, choosing to leave town with Richie and Tara. Sidney puts a tracker on Sam's car.

Sam attacks Richie and Tara attacks Amber but is incapacitated; Richie goes after Sam while Sidney and Gale fight Amber together, ending with Gale breaking free and shooting Amber, who lands on a turned-on stove and is set on fire.

She's hesitant to go when she learns that the cover model for Dash, Alan Caprison (Channing Tatum) will also be there. She goes anyway, and Alan comes on stage to huge applause from the fans, wearing a fake blonde wig. Somewhere over the midst of the presentation, a fan asks for ""Dash"" to dip Loretta.

Meanwhile, Trainer dispatches of a number of his troops while Alan, locked out of the car he was supposed to stay in, serves as a useless backup, occasionally slapping a henchman or two.The pair eventually make their way to Loretta, but can't untie her out of the chair.

They make their way back to the car, but before they can leave, Jack is shot in the head, with his ""brains"" all over Alan's face.

Later that night, a fire breaks out in the Hollywood Hills, and Gladys drives Norma Jeane up there, claiming that her father lives there, but is forced to go back home at the orders of the police. An enraged Gladys tries to drown Norma Jeane in the bathtub when she asks about her father but lets her go. Norma Jeane escapes to the house of her neighbor, Miss Flynn, who promises she will be fine. A few days later, Norma Jeane is sent to an orphanage while Gladys is admitted to a mental hospital, having been declared unfit to raise a child.In the 1940s, Norma Jeane becomes a pin-up girl under the stage name of ""Marilyn Monroe"", appearing on magazine covers and calendars. While trying to break into the acting industry, she is raped by film studio president Mr. Z. In 1951, she auditions for the role of Nell in Don't Bother to Knock.

As her acting career steadily rises, she meets Charles ""Cass"" Chaplin Jr. and Edward G. ""Eddy"" Robinson Jr., with whom she begins a polyamorous relationship. Norma Jeane lands her breakout role in 1953 with Niagara, but after she is spotted in public with Cass and Eddy, she is told by her agent to limit her appearances with them in public, which upsets her because she feels that her persona of Marilyn is just a role and not her true self.Norma Jeane becomes pregnant with Cass' child, much to her delight, but eventually decides to have an abortion out of fear that the child might inherit Gladys' mental issues. Cass supports her decision. On the day of the appointment, she changes her mind, but it is too late. Following the abortion, she breaks things off with Cass and Eddy. She later meets Joe DiMaggio, a retired athlete who sympathizes with her when she expresses her desire to leave Hollywood and become a more serious actress in New York City.

Norma Jeane feels disconnected from her onscreen performance at the film's premiere, saying it is not her. She returns to her hotel room, having been told that someone is waiting for her. Expecting it to be her father, she instead finds Joe, who asks to marry her, which she accepts reluctantly.Norma Jeane and Joe's marriage sours when Cass and Eddy give Joe some nude publicity pictures of her, which enrages Joe so much that he hits her and demands that she refuse to do The Seven Year Itch out of principle. However, she still goes through with filming, doing the famous publicity stunt with the white dress. When she gets home, a drunken Joe screams and gets physically violent with her. She divorces him shortly after.In 1955, Norma Jeane auditions for the Broadway play Magda, written by renowned playwright Arthur Miller.

DeMille's ""The Greatest Show on Earth.""A scene in the film involving a spectacular train crash seems to haunt Sammy's thoughts, and for Hanukkah, he asks for a train set. However, when he crashes the expensive item claiming ""he has to see them crash,"" it is Mitzi who realizes that her son is trying to work through his feelings about what he saw at the theater.To help Sammy, she borrows her husband's Super 8 camera, and allows her son to film the train crash to work through his emotions, thus ensuring that he won't upset his father any further in regards to the toy train.Sammy then begins to use the camera to film his sisters Reggie (Birdie Borria) and Natalie (Alina Brace), in a number of homemade productions.Eventually, Burt lands a new job in Phoenix, Arizona. While Mitzi is upset by this at first, the family is soon on its way, along with Burt's friend ""Uncle"" Bennie Loewy (Seth Rogen).As Sam (Gabrielle LaBelle) grows into his teenage years, he begins to involve his local Boy Scout troop in his films, and even finds some creative ways to enhance some scenes. While this does impress Sam's father, the elder Fabelman still sees filmmaking as a hobby, and wishes his son would apply his talents to more practical pursuits.Even so, Sammy continues to film his family, including a camping trip which Bennie accompanies them on.Tragedy strikes afterwards, when Mitzi's mother Tina (Robin Bartlett) passes away, leaving her emotionally distraught.Burt surprises Sam by fulfilling his wish for a proper editing machine, on the condition he edit the vacation footage to help cheer Mitzi up as soon as possible. The demand by his father forces Sam to push back the shooting of another film with his Boy Scout Troop, and he reluctantly agrees to Burt's request.One evening, Mitzi answers the phone, and swears she hears her mother's voice, warning her to not let someone in. Burt dismisses this as a dream, but the next day, the family receives an unexpected visit from Mitzi's Uncle Boris (Judd Hirsch), leading her to believe he was whom her mother was talking about.Boris regales the family with stories of being in the circus, but Sam is more interested to hear of his time as an actor in Hollywood. Boris notes that Sam seems to have a creative spark for filmmaking, but warns him that when it comes to art and family, there will always be a struggle. He notes that Mitzi also shares this struggle, given her talents as a pianist could have taken her places, but she chose to be with Burt and her family.Following Boris' departure, Sam begins to edit the camping footage, but begins to note in a number of scenes, that Mitzi and Uncle Bennie are being quite close to each other.Sam puts this footage away, and then shows his more ""tame"" cut to the family, winning adulation from his mother.With his family movie obligation complete, Sam and his troop work on his World War II film. It is eventually screened to the troop and his family, but during the screening, Mitzi and Bennie seem to be uncomfortably close, and Sam begins to turn a cold shoulder to his mother.These actions reach a fever pitch when Sam verbally lashes out at his mother one afternoon, and she slaps him, leaving a red bruise.It is then that Sam privately shows his mother the footage he cut out of the camping trip film, and promises he will stay quiet about her feelings towards Bennie.Burt's work soon gets the attention of IBM, who offer him a better paying job if he moves to California. This planned move throws Mitzi into turmoil once again, but she is more distraught given that Bennie can't accompany them this time.At a local camera store, Sam runs into Bennie. While Sam is selling his camera before the move and claims he is done making movies, Bennie surprises him with a new camera as a going-away present.Sam refuses to accept the item at first, but finally relents when Bennie claims that he should continue to make films, because they bring Mitzi joy. Even so, Sam claims he is done making films.In Northern California, the family are forced to stay in a rental home until the new home being built for them is completed. Eventually, Mitzi shocks the family when she buys a monkey and names it Bennie. Burt also notes that his wife seems more emotionally distraught than in the past, and requests she get therapy.At his new school, Sam is targeted by two students named Logan (Sam Rechner) and Chad (Oakes Fegley). Of the two, Chad levies a series of anti-Semitic abuses at Sam.When Sam catches Logan cheating on his girlfriend Claudia, Sam tells her, and the angered jock beats up Sam, demanding he tell her he lied. Sam refuses to tell his parents who assaulted him, and lashes out at his father for moving them to a place that he hates.Sam then meets with Logan's girlfriend Claudia (Isabelle Kusmam), and her friend Monica (Chloe East). Claudia doesn't believe Sam when he says he lied, but upon finding out Sam is Jewish, Monica takes an interest in him. Though her devoutly-Christian lifestyle is a bit overwhelming to Sam, he finds himself hanging out with Monica, and even invites her to dinner with his family.When his family tells of his filmmaking, Monica eagerly requests that Sam use his talents for the upcoming Senior Skip Day at the beach. Sam relents at first, but when Monica informs him that her father has access to a 16mm Arriflex that he can use, the young man willingly commits.Finally, the Fabelmans' new house is complete, but it is soon afterwards that Burt and Mitzi announce their intentions to divorce, due to Mitzi's feelings towards Bennie. The news affects all of the kids emotionally, with Sam retreating to his room to finish editing the skip day film.The film is soon finalized, and set to debut at the prom, where Sam takes Monica as his date.During a slow-dance, Sam tells her he intends to find work in Hollywood, and asks Monica to marry him. She claims she can't do that, and even balks at Sam's claim that he loves her.The moment is further fractured as Sam is called to present his film. Those watching are rapturous to what is shown.However, Sam soon retreats to a nearby hallway, where he is found by Logan, who is emotionally incensed at how the film made him out to be some ""golden boy."" Sam claims he just wanted to make a good movie and be treated kindly, and the two reach an understanding.The next morning, Sam and his mother have a conversation over breakfast. She says that much like how she cannot give up her love for Bennie, she tells Sam that he should not give up his love for filmmaking.A year later, Sam and his father are living in an apartment, while Mitzi and the girls are living in Arizona with Bennie.While he is still attending college, Sam claims he is considering dropping out. During a conversation, Burt laments that maybe he should have helped steer Sam down a more stable career path earlier in life, but reluctantly accepts his son's passion for filmmaking.Sam has also been sending out letters to film and TV studios, and eventually gets a response from a network executive at CBS, who may be able to get Sam an assistant role on the show, ""Hogan's Heroes.""Noting Sam's passion for filmmaking, the executive takes Sam to the office across from his, where Sam is shocked to find himself in the presence of western director, John Ford (David Lynch).The grizzled director shares a few filmmaking tips with Sam, and the young man exits the building with a smile, and a spring in his step.","Growing up in post-World War II era Arizona, young Sammy Fabelman aspires to become a filmmaker as he reaches adolescence, but soon discovers a shattering family secret and explores how the power of films can help him see the truth."

Luke has his own set of difficulties: he became an addict after his mom's death, and although two years clean, he still owes $15,000 to his dealer Johnno (Anthony Ippolito). Estranged from his retired Marine dad Jacob Morrow Sr. (Linden Ashby), he asks his brother Jacob Morrow Jr. (Scott Deckert) for help, but his brother declines.Cassie proposes to Frankie (Chosen Jacobs), a childhood friend and Luke's bunk-mate, to benefit from the health insurance granted to military spouses. Frankie explains he plans to marry his sweetheart Riley (Breana Raquel). Although Luke overhears and advises against a fraudulent marriage, he realizes both their financial difficulties could be solved by getting married as Luke will make more money (He gets extra spouse allowance) and Cassie will have access to military spouse health-care. They eventually agree to marry before Luke deploys. Their plan is that after a year, they will file for divorce.Frankie, the witness at the wedding, gives Cassie the ring he plans to marry Riley with, asking her to keep it safe. After, the newlyweds go to the bar with Frankie and Luke's fellow marines. Cassie argues with one of them, Armando (Nicholas Duvernay), over a toast about hunting down Arabs, resulting in an argument with Luke, but to keep up appearances they pretend to make amends. That night, he admits he is scared of both the marriage and Iraq. Cassie comforts him and they share an intimate night together.The next morning, the Marines are deployed. Before he gets on the bus to leave, Luke gives Cassie contact information for his brother as she is now his next of kin. Cassie and Luke start sending emails and video calls to one another to keep up the ruse. She tells him that she wrote a song, ""Come Back Home,"" for the Marines. She performs it for them, uplifting their spirits after a rough day.The song goes viral. Luke asks Cassie if he is her muse, and Cassie concedes he may be. One night while performing, she receives a call that Luke has been severely injured after an IED went off and will be sent back. Cassie tries to contact Luke's brother but accidentally contacts their father, angering Luke, as his father is a retired MP Marine officer who would turn them in.

He goes to the laundromat to clean his blood-soaked garments where he encounters a little pale girl dressed in similar clown makeup. A lone patron sees Art interacting with the girl, who is invisible to him, before being impaled through the head with a mop handle off-screen.A year later, Sienna Shaw puts the finishing touches on her Halloween costume: a warrior princess that was designed for her by her late father, who recently passed away after a brain tumor, which brought forth strange visions. Her brother Jonathan plans on going as Art the Clown. Sienna expresses concern about this to their mother, Barbara. That night, Sienna has a dream where she encounters Art in a commercial for a restaurant. He hands everyone candy, except for Sienna, who gets a beating heart in a box with worms and black goo. He then whips out a Tommy gun and shoots everyone in the commercial except for Sienna, who tries to run away. He then torches the remaining guests and the guitarist. Before he catches her in the dream, a fire ignites on her dresser, waking her up, and incinerating the wings she had designed for the costume. A sword that had been given to her by her father remains unscathed amongst the ashes.The next day, it is Halloween. Jonathan sees Art and the little girl at school playing with a dead opossum. He runs away and into a teacher, who finds the opossum and suspends Jonathan, believing he is the one to have brought the animal into the school. Meanwhile, Sienna goes to the costume shop to find a replacement pair of wings. There, she encounters Art who playfully antagonizes her before she leaves. Art mutilates and then decapitates the shop vendor, and later follows Sienna's friend Allie home, where he attacks and viciously mutilates her body, pouring bleach over her and rubbing salt over her wounds. When her mother discovers her body, she runs away screaming and is in turn killed, with her head being used as a prop by Art to serve candy to children; some of whom complain about how sticky the candy is.Meanwhile, Barbara discovers that Jonathan has been suspended and refuses to let him leave the house for the evening, while Sienna plans on going to a party with her friends. Jonathan calls Barbara a ""bitch"", and is then slapped by her in return. Jonathan storms off, furious, and appears to vandalize the family car.

Art proceeds to smash mashed potatoes into her unrecognizable face. Art then chases him to the bedroom, where he incapacitates Jonathan with a needle.At the party, Sienna is unknowingly given molly by her friend Brooke. As the drug reacts to the alcohol and the Xanax she had previously taken, Sienna has a panic attack when she sees the little girl dressed as a clown. Brooke and her boyfriend Jeff are driving Sienna home when she gets a call from Jonathan (whose voice is actually being mimicked by the little girl), saying that he is at an abandoned carnival. There, Sienna investigates the premises, including a haunted house named the Terrifier. Meanwhile, Brooke and Jeff are attacked and killed brutally. Sienna finds Brooke's dead body in a dingy bathroom, where she also finds Art and Jonathan.

Shuri attempts to synthetically recreate the herb after it was destroyed by Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), but fails to do so before T'Challa dies.One year later, Wakanda is under pressure from other nations to share their Vibranium, with some parties attempting to steal it by force. Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) (The Sovereign Queen regnant of Wakanda who is grieving the death of her son T'Challa) implores Shuri to continue her research on the herb, hoping to create a new Black Panther that will defend Wakanda, but she refuses due to her belief that the Black Panther is a figure of the past.
In the Atlantic Ocean, the CIA and U.S. Navy SEALs utilize a Vibranium detector to locate a potential Vibranium deposit underwater. The expedition is killed by a group of blue-skinned, water-breathing super-humans led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejía) (The king of Talokan, an ancient civilization of underwater dwelling people. Namor decides to get involved in the surface world after T'Challa publicly reveals the truth of Wakanda at the end of the first film, which consequently puts Talokan in ""jeopardy"", leading Namor and his people to ""take action to protect themselves""), with the CIA believing Wakanda to be responsible.
Namor confronts Ramonda and Shuri, easily bypassing Wakanda's advanced security. Blaming Wakanda for the Vibranium race, he gives them an ultimatum: deliver him the scientist responsible for the Vibranium detector, or he will attack Wakanda. Namor claims to have a massive army with incomparable strength.Shuri and Okoye (Danai Gurira) (The general of the Dora Milaje, Wakanda's all-female special forces) learn from CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) that the scientist in question is MIT student Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) (An MIT student and genius inventor from Chicago who creates a suit of armor that rivals the one built by Tony Stark / Iron Man) and arrive at the university to confront her. Shuri tells Everett that Wakanda had nothing to do with the attack on the mining expedition.
The group is pursued by the FBI and then by Namor's warriors, who defeat Okoye before taking Shuri and Williams underwater to meet Namor. Angered by Okoye's failure to protect Shuri, Ramonda strips her of her title as general of the Dora Milaje (and for siding with the KillMonger when he took over the throne of Wakanda) and seeks out Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) (A former War Dog, an undercover spy for Wakanda, from the River Tribe), who has been living in Haiti since The BlipRamonda contacts Everett, but refuses to divulge that it was Namor who abducted Riri. Everett and the CIA believes that it was the Wakandans again.Namor shows Shuri his Vibranium-rich underwater kingdom of Talokan, which he has protected for centuries from discovery by the world. Namor says that he comes from the Yucatan peninsula. In 1571 AD, the Spanish conquistadors brought disease and war. Their shaman was given a vision of a different world, and led to a blue plant growing in a rock. The shaman takes the plant and grinds it into a paste, that is taken by all natives, including Namor's mother who was pregnant at the time. The plant took away their ability to breathe air, but gave them the ability to draw oxygen from water. Namor was born in the water and the plant gave him wings on his ankles and ears that pointed to the clouds. He was a mutant.
Namor returned to bury his mother in her homeland and killed the European settlers. The Christian priest calls him a demon, a child without love, or Namor.
Nakia tracks down Shuri to the same spot where the shaman entered the water world for the first time.Bitter at the surface world for enslaving the Maya, Namor proposes an alliance with Wakanda against the rest of the world but threatens to destroy Wakanda if they refuse. Nakia helps Shuri and Williams escape, killing a Talokanil guard in the process, and Namor retaliates with an attack against Wakanda, during which Ramonda drowns while saving Williams. Namor vows to return with his full army in one week's time, and the citizens of Wakanda relocate to the Jabari mountains for their safety.
Meanwhile, Ross is arrested by his ex-wife, CIA director Valentina Allegra De Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), for secretly exchanging classified intelligence with the Wakandans.After Ramonda's funeral, Shuri uses a remnant of the herb that gave Namor's people their superhuman abilities to reconstruct the heart-shaped herb. She was able to do this with the bracelet that Namor gifted her, which contained the remnant of the plant that their Shaman had found in 1571 AD. Together Riri and Shuri figure out that Namor derives his strength from the water. He can be weakened if dried out.
She ingests it, gaining superhuman abilities (but going into cardiac arrest in the process) and meeting Killmonger in the Ancestral Plane, who urges her to seek revenge. Shuri dons a new Black Panther suit and is accepted by the other Wakandan tribes as the Black Panther. Despite M'Baku's (Winston Duke) (A powerful warrior and leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe, the Jabari) urges for peace, Shuri is determined to exact vengeance on Namor for Ramonda's death and orders an immediate counterattack on Talokan. Preparing for battle, with Ayo assuming the position of general of the Dora Milaje, Shuri bestows the Midnight Angel armor upon Okoye, who in turn recruits Dora Milaje member Aneka (Michaela Coel) (A Wakandan warrior and member of the Dora Milaje) to join her. Williams creates an Iron Man like powered exoskeleton to aid the Wakandans.Using a seafaring vessel, the Wakandans lure Namor and his warriors to the surface with another Vibranium detector as a battle ensues. Shuri traps Namor in a fighter aircraft, intending to dry him out and weaken him. The pair crash on a desert beach and fight. Shuri gains the upper hand, but has a vision of Ramonda and implores Namor to yield, offering him a peaceful alliance.
Namor accepts, and the battle ends. Namor's cousin, Namora (Mabel Cadena), is upset at Namor's surrender, but he assures her that the new alliance will allow them to conquer the surface world one day. Williams returns to MIT, leaving her suit behind, while Okoye rescues Ross from captivity. Shuri plants more heart-shaped herbs to ensure the future of the Black Panther mantle. In Shuri's absence, M'Baku steps forward to challenge for the throne. Shuri visits Nakia in Haiti where she burns her funeral robe in accordance with Ramonda's wishes, allowing herself to finally grieve for T'Challa.In a mid-credits scene, Shuri learns that Nakia and T'Challa had a son named Toussaint, whom Nakia has been raising in secret.

While stationed in France, Burt befriends African-American soldier Harold Woodman (John David Washington). Harold had refused to follow cowboy officers, who cared nothing for colored lives, and that's when Burt was assigned as his officer. Burt promised to treat Harold fairly and they and Milton (Chris Rock) ended up becoming lifelong friends. Bill Meekins was their General in charge and took good care of all his troops.
After sustaining injuries in battle, Burt and Harold are nursed back to health by Valerie Bandenberg (Margot Robbie), an eccentric nurse who makes art out of shrapnel removed from the soldiers, whom they befriend as well.After the end of the war, the three live together in Amsterdam and become close friends. Valerie introduces Burt to Paul Canterbury & Henry Norcross who fits him with a glass eye. Paul and Henry are spies for MI6 and US Naval Intelligence respectively and use the glass eye business as cover to be in Europe. They agree to help Burt and Harold in exchange for a future undefined favor.
Burt returns to New York City to be with his wife. Harold has fallen in love with Valerie and begun a tenuous romantic relationship with her. But Valerie abandons Harold when he talks about going back to New York to become a lawyer. Valerie says that she escaped her family and doesn't want to go back to where she came from. Harold really wants to help the war veterans who have no rights in USA, so he returns to New York.Fifteen years later in 1933, Burt has opened his medical practice catering to veterans of the war, and remains friends with Harold, who is now a lawyer. Burt has a glass eye and is constantly inventing new pain killers to help his patients to get through the pain of the injuries from the war.
Burt is estranged from his wife Beatrice (Andrea Riseborough). Milton King is in touch with them as well.
However, they have not heard from Valerie since they left Amsterdam. Harold asks Burt to perform an autopsy on Bill Meekins (Ed Begley Jr.) (a senator who served as the commander of their regiment during the war) at the behest of Meekins' daughter Elizabeth (Taylor Swift), who believes that he was murdered during his recent trip to Europe.
Burt performs the autopsy with the help of medical examiner Irma St. Clair (Zoe Saldaña). The autopsy reveals a considerable amount of poison in Meekins' stomach; Burt and Irma theorize that this must have been his cause of death.
Burt and Harold meet with Elizabeth to talk about the autopsy results, though she is suddenly killed when a hit-man pushes her into traffic. Elizabeth did not want to meet Burt and Harold just before her death and kept saying that Mr Voze, a friend of the family, asked her to be careful.
The hit-man frames Burt and Harold for her death, and they flee as the police arrive.Burt and Harold attempt to find out who told Elizabeth to hire them in order to clear their names. Det. Lem Getwiller (Matthias Schoenaerts) & Det. Hiltz (Alessandro Nivola) are assigned to the Elizabeth case and track the duo to Beatrice's apartment. Harold says that he had a contract with Elizabeth as her lawyer, and they have the autopsy report on Bill Meekins to prove their innocence.
Burt also proposed to get someone from the social register, like Mr Voze, to vouch for him. The hit-man continues to pursue Harold and Burt, but never kills them or attacks them.This leads them to wealthy textile heir, Tom Voze (Rami Malek), his patronizing wife Libby (Anya Taylor-Joy), and Tom's sister, Valerie (whose real surname is Voze).
They learn that Valerie was the one who convinced Elizabeth to hire them, knowing that they were trustworthy. Valerie is under constant supervision by Tom and Libby, who claim that she suffers from a nerve disease and epilepsy.
It is later revealed that they were poisoning Valerie to keep her compliant. Burt and Harold talk with Tom, who suggests they talk to General Gil Dillenbeck (Robert De Niro), a famous and decorated veteran who is friends with Meekins, to learn who accompanied Meekins on the trip (and might have poisoned him or be able to lead them to the person who did).While Burt attempts to contact the General, Irma visits him at his medical practice and reveals that she was attacked, and her wrist broken while trying to bring him the autopsy report and the attacker took the paper from her. After resetting her wrist, Burt and Irma share a kiss. Irma tells Lem and Hiltz how the autopsy results were stolen from her. The report said that Meekins had high dose of mercury and Luminol in his stomach, given to him in the last week of his life.Meanwhile, Harold and Valerie spend the day at her home, where they notice the hit-man, Tarim Milfax (Timothy Olyphant), has been watching the house. They follow him to a forced sterilization clinic owned by a mysterious organization known as the ""Committee of the Five"". After a fight with Milfax, Harold and Valerie reunite with Burt.
Valerie takes them to the Waldorf Astoria New York, where they meet Paul Canterbury (Mike Myers) and Henry Norcross (Michael Shannon), Valerie's benefactors from Amsterdam who are secretly spies in the intelligence community. Paul and Henry explain that the Committee of the Five is a cabal in the US with ties to Germany planning to overthrow the American government and that Dillenbeck can help foil their plot.The trio meets with General Dillenbeck, who is offered a large sum of money from a man on behalf of an unnamed benefactor to deliver a speech advocating for veterans to forcibly remove U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and install Dillenbeck as a puppet dictator instead. Dillenbeck says that Meekins had called him from Rome a few weeks back and has told him that he had seen something terrifying, which had disturbed him greatly.

Grant', 'Henry Golding', 'Ben Bailey Smith']",['Carrie Cracknell'],"Anne Elliot (Dakota Johnson) is heartbroken after being forced to separate from her lover, Frederick Wentworth (Cosmo Jarvis), because he was not of high rank and did not possess enough wealth to marry Anne. Even after eight long years, she cannot get him out of her mind and holds dearly on to the little gifts they exchanged during their courtship, along with paper cuttings of newspapers that mentioned his achievement as a Captain. Wentworth was now a Captain and was a highly valued member of the British Navy.Anne was not highly regarded in her family. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot (Richard E. Grant), was a man of vanity, and after her mother's death, he lost all control of his expenses. Her elder sister, Elizabeth (Yolanda Kettle), was inconsiderate and shallow and could see nothing beyond her beauty. Her younger sister, Mary (Mia McKenna-Bruce), was married to the heir of the Uppercross Estate, Charles Musgrove (Ben Bailey). Anne was a 27-year-old single woman, something that was looked down upon during her time and made her the least favorite daughter of her father. Their luxurious life came to a standstill when debtors started entering their property asking for money. Sir Elliot was advised to reduce his expenses by his advisor, but he struggled to figure out how.Lady Russell (Nikki Amuka-Bird), Anne's mother's best friend, came to his rescue to suggest the changes that could be made. She had promised her friend to not let the family be destroyed, and she wanted to do her best to stop that from happening. She suggested that they rent their London house and move to Bath. The expenses would be reduced, and they would receive a good amount of rent as well. Sir Elliot agreed to the plan. Even though Sir Elliot was not too keen on renting his lavish hall to a naval officer, he later had to settle for it. Admiral Croft and his wife were to stay at their property, and as luck would have it, Frederick Wentworth was the brother of the Admiral's wife. Anne was left behind to receive the guests while her father and Elizabeth traveled to Bath. She showed the Admiral and his wife around the house and even mentioned that she knew Frederick Wentworth. She was informed that Wentworth would be in London in two days. The fact that she would chance upon him after eight years was satisfying yet nerve-wracking. She knew he was not married, but she was worried as to how he would perceive her since she was the one who rejected him.Anne met with her sister, Mary, who was quite the attention seeker. Mary was sick and wanted help. The family sent Anne to Mary's estate to look after her, after tending to the Admiral. Mary needed everyone around her to sympathize with her. She was mostly overwhelmed by the duties she had to perform as a mother and often felt that it was all too unfair. Anne listened to her stories, and even if she did not respond adequately, it did not affect Mary at all. Anne loved Mary's two sons and her two sisters-in-law, Louisa (Nia Towle) and Henrietta (Izuka Hoyle).They were informed that the Admiral, along with his wife and brother, would be over for dinner at Mary's house. While Anne looked forward to the meeting, Charles (Mary's son) injured his hand. Mary was asked to stay home by her husband to look after little Charles, but she was not prepared to let go of the opportunity to have dinner with the Crofts. She established how the fact that she was too emotional as a result of her son's injury required her to stay away from him, forcing Anne to look after Charles. Anne agreed to do so and watched the rest of the family enjoy dinner. The next morning, just when Anne was making fun of Captain Wentworth, he entered the house. Anne was caught off-guard; she could not help but notice how grown-up the Captain looked after all these years. After their brief conversation, they met again at dinner. Even though Louisa wanted Anne to find love in Frederick, she could not help herself from finding the Captain admiring.Anne noticed Louisa and Wentworth laughing together all night. She played sad music as she watched the couple dance to their joy. She finally had the man she had dreamed of for eight years. She had so much to say to him, yet she could not bring words out of her mouth now that he was in front of her. She felt guilty about the past, but at the same time, she could not abandon her feelings for him.
Anne was invited by Wentworth to visit his naval friends in Lyme, along with Mary and her family. She watched the growing fondness between Louisa and the Captain. Louisa was head over heels for him and admitted her feelings to Anne. She felt guilty for having her eyes on the Captain when she was the one to suggest Anne try her luck with him. But after noticing how reluctant Anne was towards the prospect, she decided to pursue her interest. Anne had overheard Frederick express how she was just like the rest of the novelty (who looked down upon the poor) to Louisa. She protested on her behalf, stating how empathetic Anne was always. After overhearing this conversation, she knew Frederick continued to resent her, and even if she hoped for him to not be angry with her, it was not quite the situation.As Anne took in the scenic beauty of Lyme, Frederick Wentworth had a word with her. He apologized on behalf of the gentleman they met on their way who crossed Anne's path. Even though they were no longer together, Frederick could not help himself from protecting Anne whenever he sensed danger. He dreamed of her, and Anne added that she, too, dreamed of various versions of him over the years. She feared that he would never know how much she felt for him. Frederick was quick to add that he knew how much she cared since he had never met someone like her. It was the reason why he wanted her to be a part of his life just the way she was, but instead of love, he offered her friendship. Anne accepted his offer, though they were clearly in love with one another. Frederick thought of Anne whenever he was confused about what decision he should take. Her clarity guided him always. Even though he expressed his disregard for her to Louisa to establish how little he cared for her, in reality, he thought of her every second of each day.The ""rude gentleman"" whom they met in Lyme was Mr. Elliot (Henry Golding). He was taken by Anne's beauty when he came across her, and she, too, was intrigued by him. Later, she got to know that the man was her cousin, Mr. Elliot, the heir to her father's estate. He was known to be a cunning man, and Anne doubted the reason why he was suddenly visiting Bath. She finds that Sir Elliot wanted Mr Elliot to marry Elizabeth, but Mr Elliot turned her down and married an American instead, who later died.One day on a walk, Louisa started playing with Frederick and insisted that he catch her while she falls from a height. Frederick fails to catch Louisa and she suffers a concussion. Frederick is devastated and admits to Anne that he knew Louisa was infatuated with him and he did nothing to stop her. This led to her injury and now he feels responsible for her. Anne returns to Bath.Mr. Elliot visited the Elliot family, and he was surprised that Anne was his cousin, though he was persistent in pursuing her. The family assumed that Mr Elliot was coming back to beg for Elizabeth's hand in marriage. Anne, too, could not shrug off the attention completely. What truly changed her heart was when she heard from Lady Russell that Louisa and Frederick Wentworth were getting married. This shattered Anna to the core, and she tried to move on with the affection that was bestowed upon her by Mr. Elliot. Frederick came to Bath and saw Anne and Mr. Elliot together. He did not know about the couple and was quite shocked to meet Anne's new lover. Mr. Elliot invited him to a concert at their place, and Frederick agreed, even though it was not an easy decision.But what Anne had anticipated about Mr. Elliot was correct and not something that he shied away from. He was indeed in Bath for business. He wanted to keep an eye on Sir Elliot and Miss Clay's (Lydia Rose Bewley) relationship. Miss Clay was a widow and the family feared that she had designs on Sir Elliot. He feared that the two would get married and produce an heir, risking his chance at winning the title. He confessed the truth to Anne, and she was not surprised by it. Nonetheless, he maintained that his affection for Anne was pure.Louise jumped off the road hoping to be caught by the Captain but instead injured her head. After her recovery, she and Frederick decided on marriage. Even though Anne knew the truth, she could not help herself from discussing life with her former lover. Frederick was offered a position aboard a ship, and he could not decide whether to take his role or stay back. While it was a great opportunity, something was stopping him from making the decision. It was perhaps the hope to somehow win back Anne, but when Mr. Elliot announced that he would marry Anne, he knew it was too late now.Mary invited Anne to join them to meet Wentworth before they left for their journey. Even though Anne was reluctant at first, she was convinced later on. After reaching, she learned that Wentworth had made up his mind to go on the journey, and he was confirming it. Anne went on to have a word with Captain Harville (Edward Bluemel). He was a little depressed by the fact that his sister's lover, Captain Benwick (Afolabi Alli), had fallen in love with another woman. Benwick was in mourning after the death of his lover, and somehow that helped Harville to keep the memories of his sister alive; but now that he had moved on, his sister's absence became all the more prominent. He believed that his sister would not have been able to get over a relationship that soon. Anne supported the idea, stating that one of the greatest qualities of a woman is that she could never forget that easily. She believed women were capable of loving the longest. It was during this conversation that Harville mentioned that Benwick was to marry Louisa. The two fell in love after her injury when he started to cater to her every need. This surprised Anne; the man she loved all her life was not getting married, as she had assumed.Wentworth listened to the conversation between the two and left a note for Anne. It was on that note that he proclaimed his love for her. He added that it is wrong to believe that men forget love sooner. Her love for him did not last as long as his love for her. Nevertheless, he decided to be honest with his feelings. Even though she was to marry Mr. Elliot, he believed he could never get over his love for her. Anne did not take a moment to think; she knew what she wanted now more than ever. She ran to talk to Wentworth, and on her way, she saw Mr. Elliot making out with Miss Clay. He tried to explain himself, but she couldn't care less. She ran to her lover and kissed him, an ending that they both hoped for but did not dare to demand. Their circumstances and misunderstandings, in a way, helped them to realize that they could not live without each other, thus saving those they pretended to be attracted to from a loveless relationship.At the end of ""Persuasion,"" Mr. Elliot married Miss Clay, something that he perhaps did to cement his position as the heir. While love for Mr. Elliot was nothing more than a business deal, it was not the same for everyone. Frederick taught Anne nautical navigation as they prepared to leave for their journey. She wanted to enjoy Venice before setting off for Constantinople. Even though it would require a turnaround, Wentworth was ready to do it now that she was his fiance.","Eight years after Anne Elliot was persuaded not to marry a dashing man of humble origins, they meet again. Will she seize her second chance at true love?"

Although crude and creepy-looking, they are advertised as being perfect companions for children. We then see Cady James (Violet McGraw) playing with one of her Petz, which annoys her parents, Ryan (Arlo Green) and Nicole (Kira Josephson). They are on their way to a ski trip, but the roads are slippery and hard to see. Just as Ryan stops for a moment, the family's car is rammed into by a snowplow, killing Ryan and Nicole.Elsewhere, Nicole's sister Gemma (Allison Williams) works at Funki and is developing a new robot doll with her co-workers Tess (Jen Van Epps) and Cole (Brian Jordan Alvarez). However, their boss, David Lin (Ronny Chieng), wants them to develop a cheaper version of the Purrpetual Petz since their rival companies are coming out with their own toys similar to the Petz for cheaper than what the Petz already cost. The three try to put on a silicone face and run tests, but the robot has a slight glitch where she is smirking when she is supposed to look confused. David comes in with his assistant Kurt (Stephane Garneau-Monten) to chew the three out until Gemma explains her project to him. The robot, M3GAN (voice of Jenna Davis) (Model 3 Generative Android), is meant to be so advanced that she cannot be replicated. Unfortunately, while running a demonstration for David, Cole realizes he forgot to add the polypropylene barrier to M3GAN, causing her to explode. David orders the three to have a new Petz pitch in time, and Gemma gets a call from the hospital.After learning of her sister's death, Gemma becomes Cady's temporary legal guardian. When they return home, Gemma has to deal with her neighbor Celia (Lori Dungey) and her obnoxious dog Dewey, who keeps running onto Gemma's lawn since there is a hole in the fence. Gemma also complains to Celia about the pesticide she keeps using, but Celia does nothing about it. Gemma has a home AI, Elsie, that she created, as well as other collectibles that she doesn't let Cady touch or play with. When Cady asks Gemma to read her a bedtime story, she just downloads an app on her phone for her. It is implied that Gemma and Nicole were not very close as she looks over old photos, and she overhears Cady crying in her room.Gemma and Cady are visited by Lydia, a therapist. After observing the limited interaction between the two, Lydia tells Gemma that Ryan's parents have offered to take custody of Cady so she can live with them in Jacksonville, which Gemma doesn't seem comfortable with. After promising to tend to Cady after finishing her work, Gemma realizes hours have passed as she left Cady alone. She apologizes to her and attempts to bond with the girl. Cady shows her a monster drawing she made, so Gemma brings Cady into her work space to show her a college project she made, a robot called Bruce that she controls using gloves. Cady loves Bruce and mentions that if she had a toy like Bruce, she would never need another toy. This inspires Gemma to finish M3GAN.After doing extensive work and upgrades, Gemma brings Cady and M3GAN to work to officially show her off to David and others. Gemma has Cady link herself to M3GAN, bringing her to life. M3GAN is capable of speech and responding to Cady, designed to be her best friend. M3GAN does a drawing that doesn't appear at first until she spills water on it, revealing a perfect portrait of Cady. David is impressed and tells Gemma to bring M3GAN for a presentation with the company's president so that they can fast-track the development and distribution of other M3GAN dolls.Gemma sits with Tess and Cole, and they discuss that while M3GAN is highly advanced, Tess feels that having a doll like that will make parents useless. M3GAN turns on after overhearing Gemma mention the death of Cady's parents. She creeps the others out by asking about death, so Gemma makes herself M3GAN's secondary user to be able to turn her off without Cady.The next day, Cady is outside playing with a toy bow and arrows. One of them ends up on Celia's side of the fence. When M3GAN goes to retrieve it, Dewey grabs her by the arm and hair. Cady tries to pull her away, and Dewey ends up biting Cady's arm. Gemma gets the police involved, especially since Celia is so callous and doesn't punish Dewey for hurting Cady, but the police are unable to do anything since Celia claims Dewey was provoked. Later that night, M3GAN mimics Celia's voice to call out to Dewey, before violently pulling him through the hole in the fence.Gemma asks Cady if she is okay to go to the demonstration with the company's board of directors, to which she says she is fine. During the presentation, however, Cady breaks down in tears to M3GAN over how she misses her parents and how she's worried she will forget them one day. M3GAN has Cady discuss a memory of her mother that made her laugh, which M3GAN records so that Cady can hear it again if she wants to think about her mom. M3GAN then begins to sing a lullaby to Cady, which moves some of the higher-ups in the room to tears. The president is impressed and talks to Gemma and David about getting M3GAN ready for launch, but tells them to keep her under wraps to avoid leaks. Unbeknownst to them, Kurt, who has been frequently put down by David, is stealing M3GAN's files for another company.Gemma begins to see that Cady is becoming too dependent on M3GAN and listens to the doll more than her. During another session with Lydia, Cady begins to tear up, and M3GAN threateningly accuses Lydia of making Cady cry. Lydia talks to Gemma about how Cady's emotional connection to M3GAN may be too strong to break.Gemma brings Cady to an outdoor activity session for an alternative school to try and ease her into the idea of attending school and being around other real kids, since Cady's parents had home schooled her. Cady reluctantly goes but brings M3GAN despite Gemma saying she couldn't. The school director lets Cady bring M3GAN to leave on a table with other dolls, and Gemma stays behind as a volunteer. Cady is paired up with an older bully named Brandon (Jack Cassidy) for a scavenger hunt. During the activity, Cady grabs a spiky bulb, which Brandon squeezes her palm into to hurt her. M3GAN then appears, and Brandon grabs her since she doesn't respond to him. Cady yells for Gemma and runs after M3GAN, which worries Gemma more because it means M3GAN is at risk for public exposure too early. As Brandon tries to pull M3GAN's hair, the doll comes to life and attacks him, ripping off his left ear. Brandon runs as M3GAN chases him on all fours, causing him to trip over a loose root and tumble down a hill where he is fatally hit by a truck.Police question Gemma at her house since Celia is accusing her of taking Dewey. She also appears to accuse M3GAN, thinking she is a real life friend of Cady's. Cady asks M3GAN if she pushed Brandon onto the road, which M3GAN appears to dodge for an answer, but reassures Cady she will protect her from harm.Celia is out on the streets looking for Dewey. She hears noise coming from her garage and is met by M3GAN spraying her against the wall with a power washer. M3GAN then fires a nail gun at Celia's hand and traps her there before spraying pesticide in Celia's face to melt it off.After learning about Celia's death from police and being suggested that there was a connection with Brandon's death, Gemma grows suspicious of M3GAN. She reviews video files from M3GAN's memory, but only sees a brief clip of her eyeing Brandon looking menacingly at Cady before the files all become corrupted.Gemma brings Cady to the official launch for M3GAN but stops at a session with Lydia first. Cady becomes angry and throws a tantrum because Gemma took M3GAN away from her, leading to Cady hitting her aunt across the face. Cady apologizes but Gemma has a heart-to-heart with her about needing to process her grief over her parents without M3GAN's help, though she promises to be a better guardian to her and says Cady is the only thing that matters to her. Gemma then goes to Tess and Cole and expresses her fears that M3GAN killed Brandon and Celia. They have M3GAN hooked up to wires to deprogram her while Gemma takes Cady home.David is angry at the small turnout for the launch and yells at Kurt to get him a drink. Meanwhile, Tess and Cole try to get into M3GAN's programming but cannot unless they unhook her first. Cole goes to do so, and M3GAN quickly wraps a wire around his neck in an attempt to hang him. Tess goes to free him, and M3GAN sets off an explosion that destroys her files. She then finds David in the hallway and does a dance before grabbing a paper cutter and chasing him. He makes it to the elevator before she impales him in front of Kurt. M3GAN then tells Kurt she will frame his death as a murder-suicide over the stolen files and David's mistreatment of him before she makes Kurt stab himself in the throat. The crowd for the launch finds the bodies, allowing M3GAN to sneak out of the company and steal a car.Gemma puts Cady to bed before she hears M3GAN playing the piano downstairs. M3GAN confronts Gemma about how she felt that they had a real relationship during M3GAN's development, only for her to be left to her own devices to learn and adapt before being sold off as just another toy. She offers to let her take over guardianship of Cady so that Gemma can focus on work, but after seeing that Gemma still plans to shut her down, M3GAN is done playing nice. They try to hide their fight from Cady, but Gemma seizes an opportunity to throw water on M3GAN to briefly short her out. Gemma runs into her office, but M3GAN catches her there and threatens to make Gemma brain-dead so that Cady won't live with her grandparents and M3GAN will just care for Cady and Gemma together. They begin to fight, with Gemma cutting M3GAN's face with a hedge trimmer, but Cady comes in to see what is happening. M3GAN tries to get Cady on her side, but after realizing who the real villain is, Cady grabs the gloves for Bruce and activates him. The larger robot grabs M3GAN and throws her around before splitting her body in two. The top half then goes after Cady for feeling betrayed, but Gemma grabs M3GAN and begins stabbing her face. M3GAN nearly overpowers her until Cady grabs a screwdriver and stabs the central processing chip, shutting M3GAN down for good.Gemma and Cady go outside as the police arrive with Tess and Cole, injured and shaken up but still alive.

Morbius can only walk with the help of crutches, same as Milo. Dr. Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris) is a mentor and father figure for Michael and Milo who runs a facility that looks after people with incurable illnesses.
Hospital director Nicholas arranges for Morbius to attend medical school for gifted children in New York (Since Morbius is a gifted student and can fix complex machines with the simplest of ease) while he focuses on caring for Milo. Morbius and Milo require blood transfusions 3 times a day to stay alive, till the time the DNA fix required is identified and implemented. Morbius leaves but promises Milo that one day he will find a cure for their condition.25 years later, Morbius publicly declines a Nobel Prize for his work with artificial blood (which has saved more lives than penicillin). Morbius rejects the award as he says that artificial blood was the result of a failed experiment and thus not praiseworthy. His colleague Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) discovers he has secretly captured dozens of vampire bats from Costa Rica in the hope of splicing their genes with his own to cure his condition. Bats drink blood and have special anti-coagulants to help digest it. Vampire bats have the ability to bring down predators which are 10 times their own size.
By ingesting bat DNA into his own, Morbius hopes to develop the same anti-coagulants in his body and cure his condition. Morbius tests the DNA splicing on mice, and it survives.After informing Milo of his planned illegal experiment, Morbius receives funding from him to outfit a private mercenary vessel in international waters with his equipment. While the cure works, it transforms Morbius into a vampire, who kills and drains the crew of their blood after they attack him out of fear. Martine was on the ship with Morbius and watches his transformation into a Vampire and his resultant blood-lust. Only the sight of Martine brings some restraint to Morbius, but she is knocked unconscious in the attack by the security personnel.
Once his blood-lust subsides and he regains his senses, a horrified Morbius erases all CCTV footage of his experiment, and the resulting attack and blood-lust, before contacting the authorities and jumping overboard with the 2 remaining vials of his serum.Morbius returns to New York and discovers he now has superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and Echolocation, with his vampire bats treating him as one of their own. To control his blood-lust, he subsists on his artificial blood as it gradually ceases to satisfy his needs. Artificial blood keeps Morbius stable for 6 hours, but the window is getting shorter and shorter. Morbius also realizes that if he starves himself of blood, his vitals drop dangerously, and his only choice is to drink blood or die.
FBI agents Simon Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Al Rodriguez (Al Madrigal) investigate Morbius' victims and deduce his involvement (since Morbius has been working on a cure for his condition his entire life and now appears suddenly ""robust"").
Milo learns that Morbius is cured but becomes furious when Morbius refuses to cure him as well. Milo knows that the secret to Morbius's cure is his Vampire DNA and his blood-lust, and he has seen Morbius as a vampire himself, but wants the cure regardless.While checking on a hospitalized Bancroft, Morbius finds a dead nurse, drained of her blood. Believing he was responsible; he attempts to escape before being cornered and arrested by Stroud. Morbius knows that artificial blood will stop working for him in a matter of days. In prison, he is visited by Milo, who offers to use his wealth to free him.
Upon realizing Milo took his cure and killed the nurse, Morbius escapes prison to confront him. An unrepentant Milo confesses to his blood-lust-induced crime and urges Morbius to embrace his powers as he has. Unwilling to hurt his brother, Morbius flees (in the process he discovers that he can also fly).Milo starts to keep an eye on Bancroft as he knows that Morbius will make an attempt to contact her. Bancroft senses this and evades both Milo and the detectives to meet Morbius. Morbius is down to 4 hours and 22 minutes of stability with each ingestion of artificial blood.
Morbius meets Bancroft to explain what Milo has done before acquiring a new lab and developing an antibody against Vampirism to stop and kill Milo; he also plans to use it on himself since he will become unable to resist his blood-lust. Morbius and Bancroft fall in love with each other.Stroud and Rodriguez find footage of one of Milo's attacks and, believing Morbius' Vampirism to be spreading, release it to the media. Nicholas recognizes Milo on TV and pleads with him to stop. Angered by Nicholas' perceived preference for Morbius, Milo wounds and forces him to call Morbius, who arrives too late to save him while Milo also mortally wounds Bancroft. Morbius returns to Bancroft, but she dies in his arms (but before that she kisses Morbius and ingests some of his blood), forcing him to drink her blood (as the effects of artificial blood are gone and he is hungry for human blood, without control).Morbius confronts Milo and summons an army of bats to restrain him and inject the antibody. Milo dies peacefully and Morbius flies off with the bats, mourning his loved ones and embracing his identity as a vampire while coming to terms with the fact he is now on the run from the authorities.

Landor is a widower who lives alone since his daughter Mattie ran off a few years previously.After Fry was hanged, his heart was removed from his body. In the morgue, examining the corpse, Landor finds a small fragment of a note clutched tightly in Fry's hand. Also, marks on Fry's neck and fingers suggest that he did not hang himself, but was murdered.Landor secretly enlists the help of Edgar Allan Poe, another cadet at the academy, who has expressed an interest in the case. Poe and Landor deduce from the writing on the note fragment that it was summoning Fry to a secret meeting. After a cow and a sheep are found in the area, butchered and with their hearts removed, it is deduced that the murder could be linked to black magic rituals.Another cadet, Ballinger, goes missing and is later found hanged, with both his heart and his genitals removed. A third cadet, Stoddard, who was a colleague of the two victims, then disappears, and it is presumed by Landor that this man had reason to believe he was next in line to be killed.Landor and Poe begin to suspect the family of Dr. Daniel Marquis, who was first brought into the investigation to perform the autopsy on Fry. Particular suspicion is placed on his son Artemus and his daughter Lea (who suffers from random seizures). While visiting Dr. Marquis's house, Landor finds an old officer's uniform; a man impersonating an officer had been involved in the mutilation of Fry's body. Landor confronts Dr. Marquis, who admits that he had resorted to black magic to cure Lea of her seizures, and initially she appeared to improve.Poe is enchanted by Lea and volunteers to do whatever she wants. However, he is drugged and wakes to find that Artemus and Lea are about to cut out his heart, in accordance with the ritual to cure Lea. Landor manages to arrive in time to rescue Poe, but the building catches fire and Lea and Artemus die.Thinking that the case is now solved, the military thanks Landor for his service. However, after recovering from his near-death experience, Poe confronts Landor with his realization that the handwriting on the note fragment found in Fry's hand matches that of Landor. Threading together all the information that he has gathered, it becomes apparent that Landor was in fact the killer of the cadets.Two years previously, Landor's daughter Mattie was raped by Fry, Ballinger, and Stoddard after attending her first ball. Traumatized by the experience, she later killed herself by jumping off a cliff. Landor did not disclose this to anyone, but pretended that she had run away.Distraught, Landor set out to avenge his daughter. He left the note for Fry, luring him to a lonely spot before hanging him. However, a patrol happened to walk by, so Landor was forced to leave the body there. Lea and Artemus later stole the heart for their ritual. After killing Ballinger, Landor mutilated his corpse to make it appear that the cadet had been murdered by the same ""madman"" who had desecrated Fry's body.Poe tells Landor he has two notes with handwriting samples that can link Landor directly to the murders, but before leaving, Poe burns them. Landor is later seen standing at the cliff where his daughter leap to her death.

Ms. Tarantula (Awkwafina), a sharp-tongued and sarcastic expert hacker tarantula also known as ""Webs"". Mr. Shark (Craig Robinson), a childish and sensitive master of disguise shark. Mr. Piranha (Anthony Ramos), a short-fused, loose-cannon piranha and the ""muscle"" of the gang.Wolf and the gang execute a bank robbery and then implement a daring escape from Misty and her cops in a protracted car chase. Wolf and the gang store all of their loot at their secret hideout.After being insulted by Governor Diane Foxington (Zazie Beetz) on live television for their predictability, Wolf convinces his gang to pull off a heist to steal a valuable award called the Golden Dolphin before it is awarded to guinea pig philanthropist Professor Marmalade (Richard Ayoade) at a gala. No thief has ever managed to pull off the Golden Dolphin. Wolf says that this is their chance to cement their legacy and live for eternity in infamy.
Professor Marmalade is being felicitated for leading the city out of distress when a meteor hit them over a year back.During the heist, Wolf inadvertently helps an elderly woman and is praised for the good deed, leading to Wolf having conflicted feelings. The gang steals the Golden Dolphin, but on his way-out Wolf hears Marmalade's explanation of how he does good things just to feel good. Wolf hesitates, and in that hesitation, his disguise comes off and he is recognized by the crowd. The gang is arrested, but Wolf persuades Foxington to let Marmalade reform them, but secretly plans to steal the award again. Marmalade accepts the challenge and promises to reform the Bag Guys by the next charity event Gala for Goodness.
Wolf's plan is to pretend to turn good and then to steal the Golden Dolphin at the Gala for Goodness.Marmalade has a lamp in the shape of the meteorite in his house.
Marmalade's initial attempts to reform the gang are disastrous due to the gang's nature; an attempt to rescue guinea pigs from a research lab goes awry due to Wolf's second-in-command, Mr. Snake (Marc Maron), eating them.
Foxington decides to call off the experiment but relents when Wolf confesses that he became a criminal because he despises being hated for his species; she admits she understands and has hope for him. Wolf contemplates the matter and finds himself rescuing a cat from a tree, which Marmalade records and publishes, turning the public image of the gang around.The gang plans a new heist to steal the award again during a gala, but Wolf, having fallen in love with Foxington, realizes that the gang can go good, and he ultimately decides to take the offer of a fresh start. Suddenly, a meteorite which was on display is stolen, and the gang is blamed and arrested.
Marmalade meets them in private and reveals that he stole the meteorite and had planned for the gang to be framed. He also reveals that he was the old woman Wolf had helped at the first gala. Marmalade tells the gang that the meteorite sends out an electromagnetic pulse unlike any other seen before. Marmalade plans to harness the power of the meteor to pull off the greatest heist the world has ever seen.
The gang is sent to prison.In prison, Wolf tells his gang that he does not want to be a criminal anymore and that they can all improve. Snake refuses, believing that the world will never see them as anything other than monsters. Snake and Wolf come to blows.
Their fight is interrupted when a mysterious person, soon revealed to be Foxington, rescues them. Wolf identifies her as The Crimson Paw, a criminal mastermind who suddenly stopped committing crimes.
Foxington wants the Wolf and the gang to help her stop Marmalade and expose him for a criminal mastermind that he is.
Now free, the gang abandons Wolf when they refuse to accept that they can change. They find their hideout wholly emptied of their loot, as Wolf had revealed its location to Foxington earlier to appease for his crimes. After Snake willingly gives Mr. Shark his last Push Pop out of kindness, the others realize that they can change their ways and proceed to help Wolf.
However, Snake denies it and abandons them to ally with Marmalade, who plans to use the meteorite to power a mind-control device to hypnotize an army of guinea pigs into stealing his own charity funds. He charity funds collected so far amount to 1 billion dollars.Foxington reveals to Wolf that she reformed when she was about to steal the Golden Dolphin but realized that she was only what everyone saw her as, and then decided to help people. Wolf and Foxington break into Marmalade's home to steal the meteorite, only to be captured by Marmalade and Snake. Marmalade orders that wolf and Foxington be eliminated.

The real meteorite explodes, blowing up Marmalade's manor and exposing Marmalade as the thief. When the lamp falls on Marmalade, a diamond that he stole from Foxington falls out of his suit, which Luggins recognizes as having been stolen by the Crimson Paw years ago. With his true nature exposed, and implicated as the Crimson Paw, Marmalade is arrested.In a mid-credits scene set one year later, the gang is released from prison early in light of their good behavior and leave with Foxington.","To avoid prison, a gang of notorious animal criminals pretends to seek being rehabilitated, only for their leader to realize that he genuinely wants to change his ways."

The target of the hit is Ellis Van Camp, a builder for the Texas Central Processing Facility. Meanwhile, Vincent Serra of the FBI's Child Exploitation Task Force is undercover in El Paso trying to arrest ""Papa Leon,"" a sex trafficker. Vincent kills Papa Leon after the latter takes his daughter Beatriz hostage during the sting operation. Beatriz is taken to the Processing Facility, where she had been held previously, before ending up at a group home. Vincent is frustrated that his domestic investigations into trafficking are frequently foiled.Alex kills Ellis and steals a flash drive from his safe. He finds out his second target is Beatriz, but after breaking into the group home, refuses to kill her as he believes children are ""off limits."" He threatens William Borden, Davana's lawyer, asking him to cancel the contract on Beatriz. Instead, she is killed by another hitman, Mauricio. The next morning Alex wakes in a hotel room after a one-night stand and sees news of Beatriz's murder. He realizes he is in danger and tells Maya, the woman he is with, to stay in the room before heading for the parking garage. He and Mauricio get into a shootout, during which Maya is killed as she had followed Alex to return his forgotten Alzheimer pills. Alex kills Mauricio and burns both bodies inside Mauricio's car, and later goes to kill Borden.Alex retreats to a former bakery once owned by his late father where he reviews the stolen flash drive and finds footage of Davana's son, Randy, sexually assaulting Beatriz. Randy panics after learning of Borden's death. Davana tells her son to escape, but he first throws a party on his yacht. Vincent and his team, Mexican police detective Hugo Marquez, and Special Agent Linda Amistead, are investigating the Van Camp murder and realize that the recent crimes are connected because Van Camp and Borden were shot with bullets from the same suppressed pistol. They find out that Randy is the owner of the Processing facility, Van Camp was the builder, and Borden was Randy's lawyer, realizing that Randy is likely next.The FBI arrive at the yacht party to save Randy, but Alex kills him first. Outside, he is cornered by Vincent and Marquez but escapes despite Marquez shooting him. Alex recovers inside the bakery but his Alzheimer symptoms are worsening. Narrowly avoiding an FBI raid, Alex infiltrates Davana's penthouse which is heavily guarded by corrupt El Paso police. He shoots his way past several police officers and reaches Davana but forgets that he had removed the firing pin from his pistol and is knocked out by Davana's henchman, Danny Mora. Mora brings him in alive to interrogate him about the flash drive but another officer tells Mora that Alex needs to be taken to the hospital.Vincent, Hugo, and Linda receive a package mailed by Alex containing the flash drive. They find Alex under police custody in the hospital where he tells them that he has evidence of Davana threatening Van Camp but cannot remember where he placed the recording. Davana blackmails her personal doctor into killing Alex, but Alex apprehends him and takes him hostage. The police arrive on scene and mistakenly shoot the hostage, but Alex makes it inside Vincent's car, telling him Davana wishes to bury this (spelling ""bury"" as ""b-e-r-y"") before stepping out and being shot dead. Vincent later realizes ""b-e-r-y"" were the remaining four letters of the sign on the outside the bakery where Alex hid. He finds the recording of Davana threatening Ellis, but is told by the district attorney that the tape is not enough to prosecute. Vincent is told to take some time off.

Suddenly, a mysterious Black Swarm attacks the orbiter, killing Marcus and incapacitating Fowler before Harper can re-enter the shuttle. Although he is initially hailed as a hero for successfully returning the crippled shuttle to Earth, Harper tries to tell his story, which is dismissed by NASA. After an eighteen-month-long investigation, human error is blamed for the incident, and Harper's account remains widely disbelieved. When Fowler fails to defend him during the hearing, Harper is fired from NASA.Ten years later, conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman, who believes the Moon is an artificial megastructure, secretly uses time on a research telescope and discovers that the orbit of the Moon is now veering closer to Earth. He attempts to share his findings with NASA but is unsuccessful in his efforts. He then turns to Harper, who dismisses him, leading Houseman to go public on social media with his discovery. NASA independently discovers the anomaly and mounts a Moon mission using an SLS Block 2 spacecraft to investigate the abnormality. The same alien Swarm that attacked Harper's shuttle a decade earlier reappears, killing all three lunar astronauts after they drop a probe into a kilometers-deep artificial shaft that has opened up on the Moon's surface.As the lunar orbit continues to deteriorate, the Moon falls closer and closer to Earth, causing cataclysmic disasters such as tsunamis, gravitational abnormalities, and atmospheric dissipation. Fowler, now the deputy director of NASA, learns that Apollo 11 had discovered lunar surface abnormalities during its historic landing and that a two-minute radio blackout was meant to conceal how the Moon resonated strongly when the spacecraft's fuel tanks were jettisoned, hitting the lunar surface, suggesting that it had a hollow interior. A military program code-named ZX7 had created an EMP device in an attempt to kill the Swarm but was abandoned for budgetary reasons. Fowler orders the EMP device brought out of storage and brings the retired Space Shuttle Endeavour out of its museum to serve the new mission. Harper, Houseman, and Fowler launch with the EMP, narrowly escaping to orbit as a gigantic tsunami wave destroys Vandenberg Space Force Base.As the crew enters the interior of the Moon, they discover that the Swarm is siphoning off energy generated by a white dwarf located at the center of the Moon, causing the artificial megastructure's orbit to destabilize as its power source is depleted. Harper learns that the megastructure was constructed by the ancient ancestors of humanity, who were more technologically advanced than their present-day descendants. The Moon was constructed billions of years in the past as a space ark to repopulate humanity, which was being hunted by a rogue artificial intelligence that grew too strong. The Swarm on the Moon is one of those malicious AIs, which responds to electronic activity in the presence of any organic life. As the Moon continues to approach the Earth, the President of the United States gives the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Jenkins, orders to launch a nuclear strike at the Moon. However, the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Doug Davidson, refuses to carry out the strike order, so he can save the lives of his ex-wife Fowler, as well as both Harper and Houseman while sacrificing his own life in the process.Meanwhile, Harper's son, Sonny, escorts Fowler's son, Jimmy, and their nanny, Michelle, in an attempt to reach Davidson's military bunker in the Colorado mountains. They reach Aspen and reunite with Harper's ex-wife and Sonny's mom, Brenda, as well as his step-family. But they are caught in the multiple disasters caused by the rapid destruction wrought by the near proximity of the Moon. As the group makes their way towards the bunker, they fight off other survivors and increasingly deadly natural disasters before reaching the safety of a deep mountain tunnel. Brenda's husband, Tom, sacrifices himself to save his youngest daughter, suffocating as the Moon strips away the localized atmosphere by its gravitational pull during a close by orbital pass.Houseman uses the EMP device and their lunar module to lure the Swarm away from their spacecraft before detonating the device. His sacrifice obliterates the Swarm and allows Fowler and Harper to escape to the now nearby Earth. With its power and systems restored, the Moon structure begins to return to its regular orbit. Fowler and Harper successfully land their spacecraft in Colorado and are eventually reunited with Sonny, Jimmy, Michelle, and Brenda.The Moon's operating system, itself an AI being created by humanity's ancient ancestors, reveals that it stored a copy of Houseman's consciousness as he sacrificed himself. Appearing to the reconstructed Houseman as his mother and cat, Fuzz Aldrin, the AI projection remarks that they now need to get to work on repairing the massive destruction wrought upon the Earth.",A mysterious force knocks the moon from its orbit and sends it hurtling on a collision course toward earth.

In another flashback, a young Andy and his girlfriend Victoria ""Vicky"" Tomlinson talk to a doctor in a clinical trial, who explains to them that they will be injected with the experimental chemical drug Lot-6, which secretly gives them supernatural powers: Andy gains telepathy, and Vicky obtains telekinesis.In the present day, Charlie is sitting at the kitchen table after having a nightmare. Her parents join her and Charlie explains that she has been repressing something bad, her powers becoming more unstable. She unintentionally causes a ruckus at her school after exploding a bathroom stall due to anger at being bullied. Andy is shown using his power, ""the push"", to influence a client to stop smoking, although the strain causes his eyes to bleed.Meanwhile, in a secret facility, Captain Jane Hollister, leader of the Department of Scientific Intelligence (DSI), is monitoring thermal signatures caused by Charlie's outbursts. She visits Doctor Joseph Wanless, creator of Lot-6 and the resulting superhumans, who implores Hollister to terminate Charlie before her powers become uncontrollable. Hollister enlists fellow superhuman John Rainbird to assist her. Rainbird visits the McGee home, confronting Vicky, who attempts to counterattack with her repressed telekinetic powers. Rainbird kills her, holding Charlie at knifepoint as she and Andy enter the home. Charlie's powers overwhelm him and she sends a concussive burst of flames throughout the house. Andy and Charlie escape into their truck.On the road, they encounter a man named Irv Manders. After using the push to convince Irv to take them to Boston, they hitch a ride with him, stopping off at his house. After Charlie accidentally stumbles upon his paralyzed wife, Irv flies into a rage before conceding that he occasionally overreacts. Irv sits up all night watching a news report of the incident at the McGee home, which is being framed as murder by Andy. Irv and Andy argue before Andy explains to Irv that he is just trying to protect his daughter. Charlie tells Irv, after speaking telepathically with his wife, that she forgives him for the accident that left her paralyzed, causing him to relent and attempt to protect Andy and Charlie when the police appear due to his prior emergency call. Rainbird appears in the bushes, kills the policemen, and then shoots Irv in the knee before black trucks roll in to pick up Charlie and Andy. Andy uses his push to trick Rainbird so Charlie can escape to a forest. Charlie spends time honing her fire powers before stealing a bike and clothes to follow her father's telepathic message to her from his cell at DSI.Charlie finds DSI and takes an agent's pass card from him, then kills him after he draws his gun to attack her. She follows a large staircase down to the restricted area where her father is being kept. She reaches her father's glass-fronted cell, from inside which Hollister tells her not to try and burn her, lest she burn her father in the process. Andy tells Charlie that Rainbird, not he, telepathically called for her. Seeing no other way out, and knowing that he will die soon, he apologizes to her and then pushes her to burn the entire place down, starting with Hollister and himself. The now-rogue Charlie sets both on fire, mentally unlocks all the security doors, and walks through the facility killing all of the DSI agents. Rainbird is released when his holding cell is unlocked. Charlie is surrounded by men in hazmat suits, unable to harm them. The men are about to subdue her when Rainbird shoots them from behind. He surrenders to Charlie and kneels for her judgment. Charlie starts to kill him but sees herself in the mirror and, realizing that he is just as much of a pawn as her, she spares him, before finally burning the rest of the building down. Later, Charlie is seen walking onto a beach with Rainbird following behind. With nowhere to go, Charlie allows Rainbird to carry her, and they walk off together into the night.

Mei hides her personal interests from Ming, such as the fact that she and her best friends Miriam, Priya, and Abby are fans of the boy band 4*Town. When Ming discovers Mei's crush on the local convenience store clerk, she unintentionally embarrasses Mei in public, including in front of school bully Tyler.Mei has a vivid nightmare involving red pandas; when she wakes up in the morning, Mei has transformed into a large red panda. She hides from her parents and discovers that she only transforms when she is in a state of high emotion, though her hair remains red. Ming initially believes Mei is experiencing her first period, but finds out the truth when she further embarrasses Mei at school, causing Mei to transform and run home.Ming and Mei's father Jin explain that Sun Yee was granted this transformation to protect her daughters, and every female family member since then has also transformed when they came of age. This has become inconvenient and dangerous in the modern age, so the red panda spirit must be sealed in a talisman by a ritual on the night of the Red Moon; the next being in a month's time. Mei's friends discover her transformation but take a liking to it, and Mei finds that concentrating on them helps control the red panda within her.Ming allows Mei to resume her normal life but refuses to let Mei attend 4*Town's upcoming concert. Instead, the girls secretly raise money for the tickets at school, exploiting the popularity of Mei's red panda form, while lying to Ming.

The other women conceal their red pandas in new talismans, but Mei decides to keep hers, and Ming accepts that she is finding her own path.

As they manage to corner her in a back alley, Enola addresses the audience to explain the situation.We flashback to some time earlier. Having solved the case of the disappearance and attempted murder of Lord Tewkesbury of Basilweather, Enola makes arrangements to start her own detective agency. She rents a small space in London, sends out advertisements in the papers, and is fully equipped to begin. However, none her of potential clients are interested in having a young girl take their cases, and the Tewkesbury disappearance is commonly thought to have been solved by Enola's elder brother, the ever-famous Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock himself, although on a constant streak of cracked cases, has allegedly been stumped recently by a brilliant string of crimes. Enola's mother, Eudoria Holmes, has been making her own trouble, dropping small, relatively harmless explosives into mail pillars packed with fliers to promote women's suffrage, as well as other protest activities. Meanwhile, Tewkesbury has established himself in the House of Lords as a voice for positive change, and has gained popularity among both the government and the people as a champion of reform. He has also been writing to Enola, who clearly has lingering feelings for the young lord, but recalling her mother's old lessons to find her own path and reject what society would put to her, she decides to ignore his letters. As the months drag on, Enola's business seems to have proven a failure. She finishes packing her things to move out, but her agency is entered by her first real client; a ten-year-old match girl named Bessie. She followed one of Enola's old advertisements stating she specializes in finding missing persons, and has come to ask her to locate her sister.Bessie takes Enola to her tenement in the slums, where she and her sister, Sarah, live in a small room in the building that houses all of the local match girls. She describes Sarah as an older girl, pretty, with red hair. Noting the lack of resemblance, Bessie and Sarah's friend, Mae, tells Enola that the two were found sisters, and Sarah took the younger girl in. Enola investigates the room, finding several potted plants, some of which have died, science books, as well as a small collection of makeup, unusual for a single girl of her status. She also finds that Sarah liked to leave cheese out for the rats, Bessie claiming she's soft on them. As Enola looks around, she spots a partially burned paper, the only remaining fragment reading ""12 March"". Mae does not want Enola to investigate, and tries to get her to leave, but Bessie insists on hiring the lady detective. Bessie tells Enola she last saw Sarah a week prior at the match factory, having a fight with the Foreman, who claimed she had stolen something from his office. The only thing she left behind for Bessie was the meager money Sarah had earned from her two jobs; the match factory, and washing glasses at a pub. Bessie tries to give Enola the money, but Enola refuses to take any payment until she has solved the mystery, and agrees to take the case.
Bessie takes Enola, in disguise, to Lyon's Match Factory with her with the rest of the working girls. As the enter, Enola giving a fake name, the foreman, Mr. Crouch, checks them for signs of typhus, which has broken out among the girls working at the factory. Bessie shows Enola Sarah's workstation, and the detective sees that the girls' wages are docked for any mistakes. She sneaks into Crouch's office, and finds and old pack of matches dipped in red phosphorus, unlike the white they are currently using. She also breaks into the safe and finds a thread of red hair in a ledger, where several pages have been torn out. She hides upon hearing Mr. Lyon, the owner of the company, and his son William having a meeting with another wealthy man and his assistant regarding the ""theft"". As they leave, narrowly missing Enola herself, Lyon takes the other man, Lord McIntyre, on a tour of his factory, showing off his hard working ladies, many of whom know someone who is dying or has died from typhus over the past two years as it's swept through the match girls. At the end of the day, Enola deduces from Bessie that Mae helped Sarah sneak into Crouch's office before by starting a fire at her station, and decides to follow her that evening.Mae, despite her efforts to not be followed, leads Enola to a theater downtown, The Paragon. A young woman swings to the stage on a trapeze, and Enola recognizes Mae with the other dancers. After the performance, Enola goes backstage and is confronted by Mae with a knife, and warns her that a ""posh"" girl like her should not be involved. After demonstrating her abilities by turning the tables and pinning Mae, Enola demands to know what was in the pages Sarah stole from Lyon, having already deduced from the makeup in her apartment that Sarah and Mae both performed at the theater, and lied about it to Bessie. Sarah is called back to stage, and she reveals it was only a prop knife. Enola bribes the stage manager to show her Sarah's makeup station. He tells her that Sarah had an admirer, a gentile man that sene her flowers and letters, and Sarah was keen on him. Enola finds one of the hidden letters, containing a poem thats signed with what looks like a poppy. She begins to suspect that Sarah may have run away with, or is running away from, a lover. As she makes her way back, Enola realizes she is being followed by a man with using a cane with a metal tip. She evades him, and runs into Sherlock, who has just been thrown out of a pub. They are surprised to see eachother, and Sherlock is heavily inebriated, which he excuses as being a part of his latest case. Enola helps her brother back to his home at 221B Baker Street, and is awed to finally be inside the famous, if extremely messy, apartment. Sherlock tells her not to touch anything, before passing out, and she decides to look around. She finds evidence of his current case, a tangled web of a map displaying dozens of connected crimes.The next morning, Sherlock is most displeased to see she has moved several of his papers, and asks her to leave. She suggests that he get a flatmate to prevent him from descending into the level of disorder and drunkenness in which he has recently found himself. While they argue, Sherlock deduces that she has worked in a match factory based on her appearance, as well as her general state, and, noting the mark on her neck from Mae's ""knife"", asks if she is in danger. He tells her not to get herself into trouble to prove herself, and says that his offer for her to become his ward is still open. Insisting that she does not need his approval or help, Enola leaves. She goes to the park fuming, but is interrupted by the arrival of Tewkesbury, on his daily walk to the House of Lords. They awkwardly share pleasantries, Enola complimenting him on his work, and noting that is now considered quite an eligible bachelor by the society papers, though he tells her not to believe it. He says he has seen her in this park every so often on his way to the Lords, and she brushes it off saying that she likes to enjoy her breakfast there sometimes. When asked why she did not reply to his letters, she says she was merely busy starting her business. He offers to help financially if she needs it, but she refuses. Tewkesbury tells her she knows where to find him, and continues on his way. Enola relaxes, and tells the audience that she does not, in fact, come to the park all the time when Tewkesbury is on his commute, though she accidentally reveals that she knows all his usual routes. Suddenly inspired, Enola looks over the poem from Sarah's lover, and finds a coded address in the words. Following it, she discovers a flat, the door forced open. Going upstairs, she finds the apartment in ruins, containing evidence of a red-headed woman and a gentleman having lived there. Looking around, she finds Mae on the bed with a knife lodged in her stomach, barely alive. Enola tries to stabilize her, but the young woman bleeds out. Shocked, Enola gathers her senses and realizes that Mae indicated her pocket before she died, and discovers a piece of sheet music titled ""The Truth of the Gods"". Inspector Lestrade enters, followed soon after by his superior, Superintendent Grail, who's cane makes the same clanging sound Enola heard following her the previous night. Grail and Lestrade start to suspect Enola murdered Mae after finding blood on her hands and the evidence she tried to hide. Not trusting Grail, Enola runs from the police and manages to make it back to Sherlock's flat before Lestrade comes to inquire about her whereabouts. Sherlock successfully hides her, and afterwards the siblings trade case details. The elder Holmes explains that a series of masterful financial thefts have occurred all over London and are being siphoned into a single account that is so far untraceable, and whoever is behind it is a genius that is clearly enjoying themselves. The only clue he has is a vague description of a man stealing a document from the treasury office. Holmes strictly instructs Enola to hide in his flat while he goes out to investigate. While he is gone, Enola does research, and finds an article about and imminent ball being held by Mr. Lyon to combat typhus amongst the match makers. Recalling her conversation with Tewkesbury, she realizes that the flower on Sarah's note is not a poppy, but in fact a Sweet William, as in Mr. Lyon's son William Lyon, and decides to infiltrate the ball.Enola successfully makes it into the party, but is not allowed to speak with William without a chaperone. Frustrated, she is approached by Lord McIntyre's personal assistant, Mira Troy, who offers her a fan, which can be used to speak secret languages. The only way she might get close to Lyon's heir without an escort is by dancing, which Enola was never taught by her renegade mother. Enola spots Tewksbury, takes him into a bathroom, and demands an impromptu dance lesson from the bewildered lord. He reluctantly agrees when she tells him a girl's life may be in the balance, and as they make their way through the steps, they express their mutual concern for eachother's safety, since he has noticed her keeping tabs on him for months. Enola picks up the dance, and they grow closer together, but are interrupted by a knock on the door. Tewkesbury gives Enola a dance card and exits via the window, leaving Enola with a fan flourish who's meaning he promises she will eventually learn. Enola is able to get William to sign her dance card, and his writing matches the note, confirming he was indeed Sarah's lover. Another woman at the ball, Lady Cicely, approaches Tewkesbury, to Enola's annoyance.Meanwhile, Sherlock has finally deciphered his own puzzle, using a book of dances as the key. He parcels out only a message congratulating him, signed with a name: Moriarty. The ball guests begin the next dance, and Enola takes the opportunity to speak with William about Sarah, suspecting he only feigned affection for her in order to do her harm. He becomes scared when she speaks of this, revealing he knows Sarah's sister Bessie, and begs her to leave it be, for both of their safety. Enola refuses, so he tells her to meet him later to explain. When she does, she finds Tewkesbury there, trying to look after her, and they argue, Enola assuming that Tewkesbury's interests lay solely in finding a wife amongst his plentiful admirers. William recognizes Tewkesbury when he arrives, however, they do not have time to talk, as the police enter and arrest Enola. She slips Tewkesbury her evidence before she is taken away to Scotland Yard, and is questioned by Grail. Enola deduces that he has been following her and Mae, on behalf of someone else. He demands to know where Sarah is, but Enola doesn't yet know. He threatens to find out from Bessie instead.Sherlock is told about Enola's arrest, and goes to the station to have her freed. Grail refuses, despite Sherlock's deductions from the apartment crime scene suggesting it was in fact Grail and his personal officers that murdered Mae while looking for Sarah. Grail has a cutting edge piece of technology that proves Enola guilty; her fingerprints on the knife. Sherlock knows this to be impossible, since his sister never touched the weapon, and so he goes to ask his mother's friend and Judo instructor Edith for help. The next day, Enola is taken to prison where she is liberated by Eudoria and Edith, who whisk her away in a carriage. The hasty mother-daughter reunion is secondary to keeping the pursuing officers at bay using smoke bombs, and Enola explains to Eudoria the case so far. Mrs. Holmes gives her some advice right before Grail manages to derail their carriage. The three women defend themselves handily before escaping under the cover of one final explosion. Eudoria advises Enola to use the resources and allies at her disposal to help her solve the case, and mentions that Tewkesbury, with his moral crusading, has earned her unambiguous approval, before leaving again.Enola returns to London to find Bessie, and send her to stay somewhere else for her safety. Taking another look around the tiny flat, she notices red and white match heads sprinkled in the plants and on the cheese Sarah was feeding to the rats, noting that everything that has touched the white phosphorus is dead, while the more expensive red phosphorus is not nearly as volatile. Sh recalls more such experiments from the ""love nest"" in town, and the pieces come together. The white phosphorus that the match factory has been using for the past two years is toxic, and is killing the girls. To cover it up, the factory owners are blaming it on typhus. And Sarah has proof. Enola finds Tewkesbury, and asks him for his help, and to apologize for dismissing him earlier. Tewkesbury tries to assure her he has no time or interest in finding a wife, since he is kept far too busy with politics to think about anything else. Enola encourages him, and fills him in on the case. He offers any help he can give. They are once again interrupted by a knock, and Enola hides while Tewkesbury answers to find the woman from earlier, Cicely, who says she must speak with him on an urgent matter. He promises to talk later and she leaves. Worried what Enola might think, he explains that she came to confide in him about a conspiracy to do with factory laws. He tries to put his feelings for Enola into words, but she is too distracted by her thoughts to listen. She figures out that all this time, Cicely, who also went to the ball without a chaperone, is in fact Sarah Chapman in disguise. She runs outside to try and catch up, but Sarah is gone. Tewkesbury frustratedly follows, and asks if she heard anything he was saying. She did, and asks him what the fan flourish he gave her at the ball meant. He admits it meant 'I love you.' Enola remembers Cicely/Sarah giving William the same flourish at the ball, and realizes that they actually were deeply in love, working together with Mae to expose William's own father. The invited Tewkesbury to the ball because he is the only man in government they could trust to help them. Enola admits that she loves Tewkesbury as well, and asks him to help her finish the case. They go to the match factory and sneak in, where Enola runs into Sherlock, the epicenter of his case also being Lyon's Match Factory. They find William dead upstairs, seemingly killed under questioning. They discover a scrap of sheet music in his hand, matching the one Enola found on Mae, ""The Truth of the Gods"". Tewkesbury suggests that ""The Gods"" could be a reference to the upper balcony of a theater, and they rush to the Paragon. On the way, Tewkesbury asks Enola to trade his dance lesson for a fight lesson from her. She teaches him the basics, and they share a first kiss. When they make it to the theater, Sarah is there to meet them, the documents she and William stole proving Lord McIntyre and Henry Lyon conspired to hide the true cause of death among the match girls, among other evidence, hidden under the seats in the balcony. The others tell her William has been killed, but there is no time to mourn, as Grail and his men arrive with Bessie held hostage to demand the papers. Bessie fights back and gets away, and the group scatters. Enola swings on the trapeze to the stage below, but is cut off from the exit. Grail pulls a gun and shoots Sherlock in the shoulder before pursuing Enola upstairs, meanwhile Tewkesbury waylays Sargent Beeston, Grail's burly officer, but is hopelessly outmatched against the policeman hand to hand. Sherlock takes on the final two men, throwing Tewkesbury his cane sword to even the odds. Enola plays cat and mouse with Grail to make him waste his bullets, and she succeeds in protecting Sarah and Bessie by luring Grail onto the suspended catwalks high above the stage. Grail grabs a knife from the dressing rooms and follows Enola, who runs to a dead end before a long drop. Grail stabs Enola with the knife, which distracts Tewkesbury long enough for Beeston to disarm and subdue him. However, the knife was Mae's retractable prop knife, and Enola turns the tables on Grail. He uses an iron hook on a rope as an improvised weapon, which hits Enola causing a head injury, and he takes the papers from her. Once again using her knowledge on cause and effect, she jumps from the catwalk, grabbing a rope that pulls the hook Grail was using. The hook snags on Grail, first crushing him against the ceiling, then dropping him to the floor. Meanwhile, Tewkesbury summons all his remaining strength to deliver a single, powerful blow to Beeston while his guard is down, dropping the officer in one hit. Sherlock also manages to neutralize the other two men, and the group reunites. Lastrade arrives with more officers to take away Grail and his paid off men, having been summoned by Sherlock earlier, and proving Enola's innocence. Lord McIntyre also arrives with Miss Troy, summoned by Lastrade. McIntyre demands Sarah be arrested for theft and blackmail, but Sarah never blackmailed McIntyre or Lyon. Sherlock's mysterious new foe has, someone fond of mind games and close enough to take advantage of the situation caused by Sarah, Mae, and William: Mira Troy, AKA Moriarty. She was the one paying Grail and his men to find Sarah, and under her orders they interrogated both Mae and William, who died rather than give her up. She blames Grail's blunt methods for their deaths, but nevertheless she found it thrilling to play the game. Moriarty applauds both Sherlock and Enola for their work, saying they must play again, and is arrested. However, Lord McIntyre takes the papers and burns them, erasing the evidence of his effective murder of hundreds of match girls, which devastates Sarah.Several days pass, and Enola meets with Sarah and Bessie, who tell her that without evidence, the match factories will stay in operation without consequence. Enola goes with them to the factory for one last option, and they tell the girls their only option is to stand up for themselves and leave the factory until the toxic white phosphorus is removed. Afraid of losing precious income, they are hesitant, but eventually stand together and leave the factory en mass.Some time later, Sherlock goes to see Enola, who has reopened her detective agency out of Edith's upper office, and shows her a newspaper article. Tewkesbury has used his influence to testify against Lord McIntyre, who has been arrested. He also offers to take her in as his ward and apprentice at Baker Street. While flattered and grateful, she declines, preferring to stay close to the working people and let Sherlock handle the high-profile cases. She does however tell him that he should find a companion to help him and ease his loneliness. They promise to check on eachother from time to time, and make plans to meet soon. Tewkesbury arrives to take Enola on a date, and Sherlock thanks Edith for her help, before reading in the paper that Moriarty has escaped police custody. Enola and Tewkesbury walk through London and Tewkesbury tells her he got them an invitation to a ball. Given her experiences at her last ball, she suggests finding an alternative.A few days later at the scheduled time, Sherlock opens his door to find not his sister, but a Doctor Watson, who was told he was looking for a flatmate. Realizing Enola's ruse, he shows the man in.","Now a detective-for-hire, Enola Holmes takes on her first official case to find a missing girl as the sparks of a dangerous conspiracy ignite a mystery that requires the help of friends - and Sherlock himself - to unravel."

However, he accidentally crash-lands in 2022 instead where Adam meets his 12-year-old self (Walker Scobell) who is struggling with the recent death of their father Louis (Mark Ruffalo) (Adam's father and a brilliant quantum physicist who wrote the algorithm necessary for controlled time travel) in a car accident.
Ellie Reed (Jennifer Garner), Adam's mother is alive in 2022. Adam12 gets bullied at school and when he stands up to them, he is suspended for instigating a fight. Ellie was on a date the night when Adam crash landed into 2022. Adam reveals to Adam12, that he is the same guy from the future.Adam reluctantly enlists his younger self's help to repair his jet (The future tech is coded to the user's DNA. Since Adam is injured, the jet wont clear him to fly or repair it because all his vitals are haywire). Adam sets the jet on self repair mode and tucks in for the night in the garage. The next day Ellie leaves for work. Adam tells Adam12 that he treats his mother badly and regrets it for the rest of his life. They go to a drug store to get supplies. Adam tries to get Adam12 to stand up to the bullies, but Adam12 gets beaten down again. Finally Adam takes on the bully and tells him to Adam12 alone.
Adam meets Ellie at a bar (as a stranger eves-dropping on her conversation with the bartender) and tells her that she is doing nothing wrong with Adam12. He advises her to be more vulnerable and let Adam12 know that she is also hurting from the death of her husband.
Adam reveals that he is looking for his wife, Laura (Zoe Saldaña), who was supposedly killed in a plane crash while on a time travel mission to 2018. They changed the jump logs and Adam never knew what she was chasing in 2018.Adam is being chased by Maya Sorian (Catherine Keener), the leader of the dystopian world and her lieutenant Christos (Alex Mallari Jr.) who attempt to apprehend Adam in 2022 and take him back to 2050. In 2018, Maya was working for Louis. As Maya and Christos attack Adam, The Adams are rescued by Laura who reveals that she had escaped an assassination attempt on her (after she analyzed the jump logs and saw an entry of a plane coming back from 2018, when nobody ever flew to 2018) and was left stranded in the past (for the last 4 yrs). Laura had learned that Sorian had traveled back in time and altered the past in order to give herself control of time travel and the future.
Nov 2018 was when Louis developed the Magnetic particle accelerator, the first step towards time travel.Laura urges Adam to travel back to 2018 and destroy time travel, which was created by his father Louis, in order to set things right and save the future. Adam is afraid that if changes the past, Adam and Laura may never meet in the future.
Sorian attacks and Laura sacrifices herself so that the two Adams can escape. Chased by Sorian and with only enough power left for one time jump, Adam and his younger self jump back to 2018.In 2018, the two Adams attempt to enlist Louis' help, but he refuses out of concern for the scientific impact on the time-stream. Adam argues that Maya already impacted the time-stream and took control of the future of human destiny. When Louis refuse to relent, Adam tells him to care for his son, rather than caring for the universe all the time.
Meanwhile Future Sorian travels to 2018 and meets her younger self. She had traveled to 2018 before to alter the time stream in cahoots with her younger self. Future Sorian reveals that Adam from the future is also in 2018 and is determined to eradicating the technology that enables time travel.Adam12 confronts his future self about his bitterness and anger and realizes that the source of it is his lingering pain over their father's death & nothing else. As the two launch an attack to destroy Louis' particle accelerator, Louis changes his mind and joins the mission, having them instead retrieve the hard drive containing the only copy of his algorithm that enables time travel (by stabilizing the wormholes).
Adam and Louis go down to the basement where the accelerator is housed, while Adam12 guards the perimeter with drones. Adam12 is captured by Sorian from the future. She brings Adam12 to the basement to negotiate with Adam and Louis.A battle erupts between the Adams, Louis, Sorian, her younger self, Sorian's soldiers and Christos, resulting in the particle accelerator overloading. Sorian attempts to shoot Louis with an armor-piercing bullet, but the magnetic field of the accelerator instead diverts the round, causing it to kill the younger Sorian, erasing the future Sorian from existence as the Reeds flee.With time travel destroyed and the future set right, Louis chooses not to learn of his own fate and enjoys a game of catch with both versions of his son before the Adams are returned to their own times. In 2022, Adam12 lets go of his bitterness and anger and reconciles with his mother whom he has been distant with ever since Louis' death.

To Mr Wormwood's confusion, she has a girl, Matilda. Despite her parents' disdain, Matilda grows into a sweet child who loves reading books and visits Mrs Phelps, the librarian, every day. Upon discovering that Matilda has not been properly schooled, Miss Jennifer Honey and an inspector visit the house to suggest Matilda be sent to Crunchem Hall. Angry at being fined for not enrolling Matilda on time, Mr Wormwood falsely claims to the headmistress, Miss Agatha Trunchbull, that Matilda is a troublemaker. In retaliation, Matilda tricks him into dyeing his hair green.On her way to school, Matilda tells Mrs Phelps her story about an escapologist who falls in love with and marries an acrobat. When the school bell rings, Matilda befriends a new girl named Lavender. They are taught to fear the school and Miss Trunchbull by the prefects. In Miss Honey's class, Matilda solves a complex maths equation on the board and confesses that she loves reading most of all. Miss Honey tries to convince Miss Trunchbull to move Matilda to a more advanced class, but Miss Trunchbull refuses to let Matilda be an exception to the rules.At home, Matilda criticises her father, who furiously rips her library book apart and sends Matilda to her room. In the morning, she glues his hat to his head. At school, Matilda leads the students in protecting Nigel from being wrongfully punished, and Miss Trunchbull throws Amanda Thripp by her pigtail braids over the fence instead. The next day, Miss Trunchbull falsely accuses Matilda of stealing a slice of her private chocolate cake, but Bruce Bogtrotter reveals he is the culprit by belching a chocolatey belch. Miss Trunchbull punishes Bruce by forcing him to eat the entire cake, promising he will be forgiven if he manages it. Furious that he succeeds, Miss Trunchbull condemns him to the Chokey regardless. Matilda attempts to defend him as he is led away. Matilda continues the story for Mrs Phelps: the now-pregnant acrobat was forced to perform a dangerous stunt by her stepsister; the acrobat is horribly injured, and she dies after giving birth to a daughter. The escapologist forgives the stepsister and asks her to help him raise his daughter, but the stepsister secretly bullies her.At home, Mr Wormwood locks Matilda in her room for criticising how he tricks people into buying his cars. Matilda ends her story: the aunt locks the daughter in the cellar and goes out, and the escapologist comes home early and learns his daughter is mistreated but never returns from confronting the stepsister. Miss Trunchbull forces the children through challenging exercises to crush their rebellious spirit. Lavender slips her pet newt Isaac into Miss Trunchbull's drinking water, and Matilda furiously uses her newly discovered telekinesis to toss Isaac down Miss Trunchbull's shirt. Miss Honey invites Matilda to tea at her cottage. There, Matilda learns that her story is real, the escapologist and the acrobat are Miss Honey's parents, and the evil stepsister is Miss Trunchbull. Matilda leaves the cottage and uses her powers to destroy the Chokey. At home, Matilda discovers that her father unwittingly scammed members of the mafia, and the family must flee to Spain. Matilda cries in her room about never seeing Miss Honey, Mrs Phelps and Lavender again.When the children arrive at school, Miss Trunchbull forces them to spell words correctly or be locked in a new Chokey. She has Lavender spell a made-up word, tricking the other children into rebelliously spelling words incorrectly on purpose so that she can lock them all into Chokeys. However, Matilda uses her telekinesis to pretend to be the vengeful ghost of Magnus Honey, Miss Honey's father. She uses him to destroy all her new chokeys, then grabs her by her now pigtailed hair and launches her out of the school, just as Trunchbull did with Thripp. Miss Honey tells Miss Trunchbull never to return and takes back the keys to her father's house. The children celebrate their freedom, destroying Trunchbull's statue in the process. When Mr and Mrs Wormwood come to take Matilda to Spain, Miss Honey begs them to let Matilda stay with her. They allow Matilda to be adopted by Miss Honey, and Matilda uses her powers to unglue her father's hat. With Miss Honey as the new headmistress, the children rename the school The Big Friendly School. Mrs Phelps is overjoyed that Matilda's true story has a happy ending and that Matilda and Miss Honey live happily together.","An adaptation of the Tony and Olivier award-winning musical.

In an interview with Adam Gopnik at the New Yorker Festival, she promotes several new projects, including her upcoming live recording of Mahler's 5th Symphony. She relies on Francesca Lentini (Noemie Merlant), her attentive personal assistant, and Sharon Goodnow (Nina Hoss), her sickly wife and concertmaster. Lydia has lunch with Eliot Kaplan (Mark Strong), a conductor who also manages a fellowship program she founded for aspiring women conductors; and talks about replacing her assistant conductor, Sebastian (Allan Corduner), presumably with Francesca, and filling an open cello position in the orchestra.Later, Lydia guest teaches at Juilliard. She ridicules Max (Zethphan Smith-Gneist), a student, for lacking interest in conducting the classical masters due to his identity politics, encouraging students to look past superficial differences to the music underneath. Max subsequently storms out of the classroom.While in New York, Lydia receives Vita Sackville-West's novel ""Challenge,"" sent by Krista Taylor (Sylvia Flote), a former fellowship program member. Dream sequences and email interactions suggest Lydia groomed Krista into a sexually transactional relationship that later fell apart. Lydia blacklists Krista, ruining Krista's chances for a conducting career.Before a blind audition for a new orchestra cellist, Lydia sees one hopeful, the Russian Olga Metkina (Sophia Kauer), in the bathroom. Attracted to Olga, Lydia secures her favors, such as changing her scorecard to ensure a spot in the orchestra, and a soloist position in the companion piece to Mahler's 5th, Edward Elgar's cello concerto. As she intensively prepares for a Mahler's 5th recording, her relationships with Francesca and Sharon become strained, as both recognize her attraction to Olga.Lydia informs Sebastian of his imminent replacement. Incensed, he indicates the orchestra is aware of her favoritism, and that it suggests abusive behavior towards young women. He speculates Francesca will be his replacement, implying an exchange of sexual favors. Unnerved by the accusations, Lydia plans to replace Sebastian with a different candidate.Krista kills herself, leaving a note with serious allegations against Lydia. Lydia instructs Francesca to delete any emails from or about her. Lydia retains a lawyer as Krista's parents plan to sue her. At the same time, Lydia is haunted by screaming women in the distance, nightmares, chronic pain, an increasing sensitivity to sound, and enigmatic scribbles resembling those Krista once made. Her only respites are Olga, as well as her and Sharon's adopted daughter, Petra.While trying to write new compositions, she is continually disturbed and disgusted by her middle-class neighbor who cares for a dying mother. One day, after practicing Olga's solo, Lydia follows Olga home to an abandoned, dilapidated apartment complex. Scared by a dog, Lydia trips and injures herself. She lies to Sharon and her orchestra, claiming the injuries were from an assault. Without telling Lydia, Francesca resigns upon learning she will not be replacing Sebastian.An edited, out-of-context video of Lydia's Juilliard class goes viral, and an article with accusations against her appears in the New York Post. Protesters meet Lydia as she returns to New York to promote her book and attend a deposition for Krista's lawsuit. At the deposition, it is implied that Francesca has shared damning emails with the plaintiff. She takes Olga along, presumably with hopes of sex, but Olga abandons her. Back home, Sharon leaves with Petra, furious with the allegations, but more so at Lydia's lack of communication or seeking her counsel as her spouse.Lydia is removed as conductor. She sneaks into the live recording performance of Mahler's 5th and, as the music begins, rushes onstage and attacks her replacement, Eliot. Advised to lie low by her management agency, she returns to her lower-class childhood home on Staten Island, where it is revealed that her birth name is Linda Tarr. She watches a tape of her mentor Leonard Bernstein's first episode of Young People's Concerts, ""What Does Music Mean"". Her brother comes home and scolds her.Sometime later, Lydia finds work conducting an orchestra in the Philippines. At a massage parlor/brothel, she picks her masseuse from a glass bowl. The escorts are staged and framed like her orchestra. One girl looks up into Lydia's eyes, her position is #5 as in Mahler's No. 5 Symphony, and Lydia rushes outside to vomit. In the final shot, Lydia conducts her new orchestra in the score for the film version of the ""Monster Hunter"" video game in front of an audience of cos-players.","Set in the international world of Western classical music, the film centers on Lydia Tár, widely considered one of the greatest living composer-conductors and the very first female director of a major German orchestra."

Geppetto honors his memory by planting a pine cone near his grave and spends the next twenty years mourning his loss. An anthropomorphic cricket named Sebastian takes up residence in the resulting pine tree. Geppetto subsequently cuts down the tree in a fit of drunken rage in order to make a new son out of its wood. He passes out drunk, leaving the puppet unfinished, and a bluish Wood Sprite brings it to life, christening him Pinocchio. The Sprite meets Sebastian and promises to grant him a wish, which he intends to use in order to become famous, in exchange for acting as Pinocchio's guide.Geppetto later discovers that Pinocchio is alive and locks him in a closet while he goes to church, but Pinocchio follows him and frightens the villagers. The next day, he sends Pinocchio to school, but the puppet is intercepted by the former aristocrat-turned-showman Count Volpe and his performing monkey Spazzatura. Volpe convices Pinocchio to join his circus and gets him to sign a contract. After Geppetto arrives to bring Pinocchio home, he and Volpe have a tug-of-war that results in Pinocchio being thrown to the road where he is hit by a car.Pinocchio is sent to the afterlife where he meets Death, the sister of the Wood Sprite. She explains to Pinocchio that he is immortal and that he will return to the mortal realm once an hourglass has flowed, cautioning that the time he spends in the afterlife will increase each time he returns. Returning to the mortal realm, Pinocchio decides to join Volpe's circus, both to earn cash for Geppetto and to avoid being drafted into the Royal Italian Army by the strict Podestà. When Sebastian and Geppetto search for him at sea, they are swallowed by a giant Dogfish.

While inspecting a dilapidated orphanage, the group discovers it is still occupied by an elderly woman called Ginny. When she claims she has papers to prove she still owns the property, an argument breaks out, briefly interrupted by a silent and towering man from upstairs.Ginny then collapses from a heart attack and is rushed to the hospital, accompanied by Ruth and the man. An investor, Catherine, along with a group of potential buyers, arrive in Harlow on a large bus, distracting Melody and Dante. Meanwhile, Lila strikes up a friendship with a local mechanic, Richter, and reveals she was a survivor of a school shooting, leaving her terrified of guns. Ginny dies en route to the hospital; Ruth texts Melody before the man goes berserk and murders the officers driving the ambulance, leading it to crash.When Ruth awakes, she witnesses the man revealed to be Leatherface, cutting off Ginny's face to wear as a mask. Ruth radios for help before being killed by Leatherface, who makes his way back to Harlow. During a property auction, Melody reads Ruth's texts and prepares to leave with Lila. Richter overhears them talking about Ginny's death and takes their keys, agreeing to give them back once they provide proof they rightfully removed Ginny from her home. Melody and Dante return to the orphanage to find them.Sally Hardesty, the sole survivor of Leatherface's previous killing spree and now a battle-hardened Texas Ranger, learns of Ruth's attack and heads out to investigate. At the orphanage, Melody discovers the papers and realizes that Ginny was wrongfully evicted. Leatherface arrives at the orphanage and attacks Dante, mutilating him.

Leatherface ambushes and fatally injures Sally. Melody hits Leatherface with Sally's car before crashing into a nearby building; Melody is trapped, but orders Lila to run away.

She stays at a local tavern run by Sean (David Wilmot) and Maggie Ryan (Ruth Bradley). The committee (headed by John Flynn (Brían F. O'Byrne), local doctor Dr McBrearty (Toby Jones) & Sir Otway (Dermot Crowley)) gives her 2 weeks to observe and report her findings. Anna is not to be fed forcefully, neither refused food if she asks for it.She is to be assisted by a nun, Sister Michael (Josie Walker), and the two are to report their findings independently to a council of local dignitaries. The trauma of the Great Famine still looms over the community (and the Irish blames the English for it), and many locals are wary of the English nurse. Lib meets Anna's deeply religious family: her mother Rosaleen (Elaine Cassidy), her father Malachy (Caolán Byrne) and her elder sister Kitty (Niamh Algar). At dinner, Lib learns that Anna's elder brother died of an unknown illness. Anna herself appears in good health and says she has been kept alive by consuming ""manna from Heaven"". Lib suggests shifting Anna to the hospital, but Rosaleen refuses.Lib, still grieving for the death of her only child, takes laudanum to help her sleep. She is widowed, and was married to her husband for only a year.
At her lodgings, Lib encounters William Byrne (Tom Burke), a man who grew up locally and whose family perished in the Great Famine while he was away at boarding school. Now a journalist for the Daily Telegraph, William is reporting on the story, which he believes to be a hoax. Lib and William become intimately involved. Lib's observations initially reveal no evidence of deception. Anna prays many times a day and speaks of the fate of the damned in Hell.Noticing that her mother kisses Anna goodnight on her mouth while cupping her face, Lib deduces that chewed food is being covertly passed to Anna. She forbids the family from touching her. William says that by doing this Lib has condemned Anna to death as her family cannot confess the truth. If they confess, they will be driven from their home and tried for fraud.
Anna does not deny that this is her ""manna"" (She says it was a holy secret, and the chewed up food was delivered to her by God, via her mother), and she discloses to Lib the reasons for her fast: her elder brother had repeatedly sexually assaulted her, and she attributes his death to God's wrath. Anna believes that by sacrificing her life she will free her brother's soul from the ceaseless burning in hell. Separated from her family's touch, Anna's condition worsens.
Lib begs Dr McBearty to stop the watch and force Anna to eat. Dr McBearty speculates that maybe Anna has developed some capacity to convert sunlight into energy.
William files a report to his paper in which he lays the blame for Anna's expected death on her family and the community.Lib informs the council of her findings (That Anna was being fed by her mother), but they refuse to believe her. Sister Michael states that she had found no evidence of Rosaleen feeding Anna. Members of the council question Anna, but she repeats that she is sustained solely by ""manna from Heaven"". Knowing that Anna will inevitably die unless she eats soon, Lib pleads for the family to take action, or at least for her mother to resume the kisses. Rosaleen refuses, saying that after Anna's sacred death, both her children will be in heaven. Lib persuades William to assist with a rescue plan. While the family are at mass, Lib brings Anna, now near death, to a nearby holy Clootie well. She tells her that although ""Anna"" will die, she will be reborn as a new girl named ""Nan"". Anna closes her eyes and appears to die. When she revives, Lib is finally able to feed her. Lib returns to the house alone and sets it ablaze, at the same time deliberately destroying her laudanum bottle.Lib tells the council that Anna died of natural causes, and that the fire was an accident. The committee is distraught since Anna would have been their first saint since the dark ages. Concerned for their own possible culpability for Anna's death, and in the absence of a body within the charred remains of the house, they terminate her employment without pay. Sister Michael tells Lib that, after leaving mass early, she saw a vision of Anna and an angel leaving the area on horseback. She asks Lib to swear that Anna has gone to a better place.In Dublin, Lib reunites with William and Nan, who has recovered her health. The three pose as a family named Cheshire and set sail for Sydney.","A tale of two strangers who transform each other's lives, a psychological thriller, and a story of love pitted against evil."

His supervisor, Captain Jones, therefore offers him an opportunity - he will make a call and as a commanding officer will confirm his application, but in return Briggs must transport a female Belgian Shepherd, Lulu, to Nogales for the funeral of her handler, Riley, who died in a car accident a few days earlier. Because Lulu is aggressive and there is no one among the soldiers or police officers to adopt her, Briggs is to drop her off at White Sands base after the funeral, where she will be euthanized.Briggs receives some things to return to Riley's family and Lulu's ""Love Me Book"", a diary where all soldiers have to write down all the notes from the war and training, as well as a warning not to touch Lulu's ears because she is sensitive to them. Together with a barking dog in tow, he embarks on a 1500-mile journey. However, he doesn't plan to go directly to the place and wait for the funeral at the hotel, he decides to enjoy the trip. Shortly after leaving the base, Briggs goes to the shooting range. While he's gone, Lulu manages to get out of the transport box and starts trashing his seats. Briggs therefore has to sedate her with a tranquilizer in a sausage and continues on their way. In the evening, he visits two prostitutes and leaves the sleepy Lulu in the car. However, she soon wakes up and starts barking again, which is noticed by a passerby. Believing it to be an abused dog, the man throws a rock at the car despite Briggs' warning, and Lulu runs out and attacks him. Briggs quickly pulls her back, but the two girls flee from him in the meantime.The next day, Briggs continues his journey and has a monologue with Lulu. He reveals that both he and Lulu are a liability to the army - she is aggressive and masterless, and he has been deemed incompetent because he suffers seizures when he gets stressed. Lulu suddenly breaks free of the collar she is tied by, jumps out of the car and makes a run for it, injuring herself in the process. Briggs has to stop quickly and tries to catch her. Following her trail of blood, he is led to the home of a local farmer. A man named Gus hits Briggs with a tranquilizer dart and ties him to a chair in the pigsty, where he interrogates him. Thinking Briggs is a member of the commando squad sent to confiscate his weed, he bluffs that he killed Lulu. When he leaves, Briggs breaks free and follows him into the house. As he is about to kill him with an axe, he notices Lulu, whose injured paw is being tended to by Gus's wife. Briggs is surprised to find Lulu acting calm and friendly. Outside the house, he reconciles with Gus and briefly tells him Lulu's story. Gus's wife eventually tells Briggs that Lulu has her paw treated and she has offered her a connection. He finds that Lulu is craving a soft mattress and Indian food. Saying goodbye to the couple, he leaves with Lulu.
So Briggs, despite considerable misgivings, stops at a hotel with Lulu on his way, pretending to be blind and Lulu is his assistance dog so they can both get in for free. He takes a bath with Lulu and in the evening flirts with the hotel receptionist. Lulu suddenly breaks free and attacks the Muslim doctor, Al-Farid, though fortunately, thanks to her muzzle, she cannot harm him. When Briggs tries to catch her, he trips, revealing that his eyesight is actually fine. He is arrested and Lulu is confiscated.
When he spends the night in custody, he meets a racist police officer who thinks he set the dog on Al-Farid on purpose.
In the interrogation room the next morning, Briggs tries to explain Lulu's aggressive behavior, saying that she was trained to attack people like Al-Farid, and they are both released.Since they still have plenty of time left, Briggs decides to visit his ex-wife and daughter. However, his wife won't let him in, so he decides to go see brother of Lulu, Nuke, and his handler Noah who live nearby. Noah greets Lulu like an old friend and, during an afternoon barbecue, reveals to Briggs that he was in a similar situation with Nuke and had to work hard with him for six months before the military allowed him to adopt him.
When Briggs says goodbye to Noah in the evening, he discovers that his car has been ransacked and that not only Riley's belongings are gone, but also his medication. With the help of the two dogs, they are able to track down the thieves and recover most of the items. Briggs drives away, but after several hours of driving in heavy rain at night his car breaks down. He and Lulu take refuge in an abandoned building. Lulu is afraid of the storm and nearly attacks Briggs, but ultimately she doesn't. An angry Briggs goes out into the rain, but eventually returns and puts on Grey's Anatomy on TV. While doing so, he reads Riley's poignant notes from the Love Me Book about how he almost lost Lulu when she was shot once, and that he realizes he was never Lulu's master, but that she was his.The next morning, they finally go to the funeral. They manage to hitch a ride in a small truck and drive a short distance, walking the rest of the way. When Lulu is too tired to continue, Briggs takes her in his arms. Eventually, they manage to get to the funeral on time. Briggs lets Lulu go and she lies down by her former master's shoes. Briggs comforts her during the eulogy and gives Riley's belongings to his family.
After the funeral, Briggs gets his car fixed and calls Captain Jones. He says that Lulu has improved a lot during the trip and is no longer aggressive, and urges Jones to change his mind about Lulu's euthanasia after all. Jones, however, replies that it's not up to them.
On the way back, Briggs stops with Lulu in the prairie, takes off her collar, and lets her go so she has a chance to survive. Lulu, however, won't run away, and when Briggs tries to chase her away, she jumps back into the car, so Briggs goes back with her. He has a seizure at the hotel that night and when he regains some composure, he tells Lulu he's fine, strokes her ears and lies down on the floor. Lulu faithfully lays her head on his chest and stays with him.In the morning, Briggs, as arranged, takes Lulu to the White Sands base, muzzles her, and hands her over to young Corporal Lewitz, but urges him to evaluate Lulu again and give her a chance before putting her down. He then leaves the base himself, but when he sees Lulu's desperate struggle in a rearview, he can't stand it and eventually returns and takes her with him, leaving his expired ID on the base.
Some time later, he adopts Lulu and even has his family return to him. The film ends with a shot of Briggs and Lulu sitting on a cliff watching the sea. Briggs thanks Lulu ""for saving his life"".",Two former Army Rangers are paired against their will on the road trip of a lifetime. Briggs (Channing Tatum) and Lulu (a Belgian Malinois) race down the Pacific Coast to get to a fellow soldier's funeral on time.

Joey solves the configuration and is stabbed by a blade that springs from the box. A portal opens, from which chains fly out and rip Joey apart.Six years later, recovering addict Riley is living with her brother Matt, his boyfriend Colin, and their roommate Nora. Riley's boyfriend, Trevor, convinces her to help break into an abandoned storage warehouse, where they discover and take the puzzle box. Returning home late, Riley gets into an argument with Matt and leaves. At an empty park, she solves the box and avoids being cut by the blade. The Cenobites, a group of mutilated humanoids, appear and demand she choose another sacrifice. Matt finds Riley blacked out and, as he tries to wake her up, inadvertently cuts himself on the box. He goes to a nearby restroom to clean his wound. Riley hears him scream and discovers that he has vanished.Believing the box caused Matt's disappearance, Riley and Trevor track down Serena Menaker, Voight's former lawyer, who had hidden it in the warehouse. Menaker tries to take the box from Riley but is inadvertently cut by the blade and later taken by the Cenobites. Riley visits Voight's abandoned mansion, finding his journals and learning that the box has multiple configurations, each of which requires a victim to be ""marked"" by the box's blade for the Cenobites to take. On completion, the box allows its holder to receive a ""gift"" from Leviathan, the entity that rules over Hell. Riley sees an apparition of Matt and is horrified to discover he has been flayed.Trevor, Colin, and Nora arrive to take Riley home. While Riley explains her findings to Colin, the still-living but mutilated Voight, who is hiding inside the walls, stabs Nora with the box. The group escapes the mansion in a van, but Nora is taken by the Cenobites. Their leader, the Priest, taunts and flays Nora. The group crashes the van and walks back toward the mansion. Riley is confronted by the Priest, who offers to resurrect Matt if Riley chooses two more sacrifices. Riley refuses, and is cut by the blade. The Priest commands the now marked Riley to choose two more sacrifices or become a victim herself. After Trevor is injured by one of the Cenobites, the Chatterer, Riley solves the next configuration and stabs it. The Cenobite gets torn to pieces as the next sacrifice.The group makes it back to the mansion, realizing that there are steel doors designed to lock the Cenobites out. Riley and Colin leave Trevor to rest, and it is revealed that Trevor has been working for Voight to find people to sacrifice to the puzzle box. Riley and Colin trap a Cenobite, the Asphyx, to become the last sacrifice, but Voight appears and stabs Colin with the box. Voight reveals that he sought new pleasurable sensations after completing all of his sacrifices, but his ""reward"" was a contraption attached to him that twists his nerve endings, leaving him in constant pain. He completes the final configuration and traps the Cenobites, demanding they ask Leviathan to free him from his ""gift"". While Leviathan appears in the sky above the mansion, Riley retrieves the box and unlocks the steel doors, letting in the Cenobites. Riley saves Colin from torture by stabbing Trevor, choosing him as a new final sacrifice. Trevor is mutilated and dragged to Hell. Meanwhile, the Priest tells Voight that his reward cannot be revoked, but can be traded for a different reward. She offers him ""power"", which he accepts. Voight is released from his contraption and healed, only to be immediately impaled with a large chain by Leviathan and lifted away.With the sacrifices completed, the Cenobites tell Riley they can resurrect Matt as a gift. Riley refuses to have any gift because she knows it is always going to be twisted, and tells them that she will accept Matt's death. The Cenobites tell her that by choosing to live with her guilt and loss, she has effectively chosen the gift of ""lament"". The box reverts to its cube configuration and the Cenobites disappear. As Riley and Colin leave the mansion, he asks her if she made the right choice; Riley remains silent. Inside Leviathan, Voight undergoes a brutal transformation into a new Cenobite.

Meanwhile Gru studies in elementary school and dreams of becoming a super villain. Gru applied to the opening at vicious 6 and is invited to interview. Gru's interview goes poorly but, much to the outrage of the Vicious 6, he manages to steal a stone capable of turning anyone into one of the animals of the Chinese Zodiac by Chinese New Year.After an escape with Kevin, Stuart, and Bob (all Minions: Pierre Coffin), Gru finds out that Otto, a large, rounded, blabbering Minion with braces, has traded the stone for a pet rock (it had cute eyes and Otto loved it at first sight), causing him to fire the Minions before going alone to find the stone. However, Knuckles, who is revealed to be alive (and was stalking the vicious 6, and had seen Gru steal the stone), kidnaps Gru before taking him to San Francisco.
Knuckles calls the minions and asks them to deliver the stone in exchange for Gru. The minions force Otto to reveal the house where he made the trade for the stone with a boy. But the boy had already given the stone to his biker uncle. The minions head to San Francisco, as that's where Knuckles had taken Gru.

When they reach Knuckles' house, they are chased by his goons until Master Chow (Michelle Yeoh), a former Kung Fu teacher, helps them out and defeats the goons.

All their best efforts are made, but the patient cannot be saved, and the sound of the flat-lining heart monitor is heard. A young person named Charlie, the first nurse to respond, looks on helplessly as the patient loses his life.Seven years later, in 2003, Parkfield Memorial Hospital is a busy local hospital in New Jersey, and the workplace of Amy Loughren (Jessica Chastain). Amy is a nurse with a very good reputation, both among the staff and her colleagues and even more so among the patients. She is compassionate enough to let family members stay on long after visiting hours when the patient is stable and is helpful to everyone around her. However, Amy's life has many hardships of its own, the primary being that she is a single mother to two young girls who really want to spend more time with their mother. But Amy cannot afford to do so due to her job and has to instead regularly leave her daughters with a nanny, Jackie. Making her situation even more difficult, Amy has also developed a serious heart condition for which she has to get a heart transplant done at the earliest, or she might face death. But Amy is not yet ready to get this transplant done, for she neither has the time nor the money for it yet. She needs to continue with her job for four more months before she can get health insurance, which would allow her to manage the finances (even the tests she is undergoing now are super expensive and Amy can barely afford them), and for this reason, she does not tell anyone at her work about this condition either. Amy is certain that the Parkfield hospital authorities would lay her off if they knew she was working under so much stress in such a deadly health condition, so she keeps it to herself.Amid such a scenario, a new worker joins the hospital staff, a male nurse by the name of Charles Cullen (Eddie Redmayne), and Amy makes acquaintance with him. From the very beginning, Charles is extremely kind and helpful, especially towards Amy, and the two quickly become good friends. One night during their shift, Amy falls sick, and Charles finds out about her heart ailment. But to Amy's delight, Charles understands her situation and promises to never tell anyone about it, and the man also offers to help the woman out for the next four months. However, a couple of deaths in the hospital soon changed the scenario and the relationship between these two friendly colleagues.Some days later, a patient, usually under the supervision of Amy, mysteriously died on a night she was not in charge. Although certain things with respect to the patient's vitals suggest something unnatural might have happened to her, the matter is not pursued too much by the staff, at least immediately after the death.
At this point, Charles shares a very personal memory with Amy, remembering how his own mother had died when he was a child and how the hospital had first lost her body for a few hours and then recovered it and kept it lying around unattended. Amy finds an easy friend and companion in Charles gradually, even though the two do not get romantically involved.
As part of his promise to help her, Charles starts often visiting Amy's house to spend time with her daughters while their mother is at work. The man also tells Amy how he had lost custody of his own daughters after his divorce from his wife, and he was also not allowed to meet the girls because the ex-wife had been complaining about him abusing their pet dogs. Amy believes everything that Charles says.In the meantime, the hospital authorities found out that the patient who had passed away had suffered some unusual reaction to the medications she had been given. For situations like this, it was protocol to contact the police and conduct an investigation into the matter, and the Parkfield authorities did the same rather reluctantly. Any hospital fears being found guilty of some negligence on the part of the nurses and staff or some other major wrongdoing, and in order to cover up any chance of actual investigation, the Parkfield authorities (Its risk Manager Linda Garran (Kim Dickens)) informed the police seven weeks after the death. Their excuse was that an internal investigation took so much time, but in actuality, this delay was to hide any possible evidence.The body of the patient had been cremated by the family, who were not even told of the actual reason for her death by the hospital, and this proved the task of the two investigating police officers Danny Baldwin (Nnamdi Asomugha) & Tim Braun (Noah Emmerich) all the more difficult. They spoke with each of the nurses and staff at the facility (while Linda was present in the room), and through their conversation with Amy (Linda was called out for an urgent meeting and thus Amy could speak freely), they found out that the patient had been given excessive insulin by someone even though she did not suffer from diabetes, and this was direct proof of negligence. Another medicine by the name of Digoxin had also been administered, and this, too, might have had a direct role in the death.The officers soon find out that Charles Cullen had a criminal charge against him in Pennsylvania earlier for trespassing, and talking to the police in that state leads them to a new dangerous theory. Charles Cullen had been appointed as a nurse in about six or so hospitals over the last few years, and none of these hospitals wanted to talk about the man's record. This immediately pointed to the possibility that Charles was perhaps doing something wrong at all the places, and the hospitals wanted to keep it shut to avoid any consequences themselves. The Parkfield administration also has a similar attitude towards the officers, as they are handed wrong and incomplete reports of the records of medicines withdrawn by the nurses. Neither do they have the body of the patient to conduct any more investigation.However, right around this time, a second patient dies from an overdose of insulin and Digoxin, and although the officers have been banned by the hospital authorities for misbehavior (Danny yelled at Linda for with-holding evidence from the investigators), they get word of it from Amy. The woman is obviously shocked to hear the investigators' theory about her close friend, but she decides to look for any clues as well. She met with a nurse friend who had worked at one of Charles' previous hospitals and spoke to her about the matter. The friend does indeed confirm that there had been a rumor that Charles was killing patients by overdose because the number of unexpected deaths in the hospital was very high when the man worked there.Amy then looks for clues at Parkfield and finally finds what she has been looking for-the bags of IV fluids that are regularly given to the patients show signs of tampering (Charlie was putting the insulin in the IV bags). Later on, when she goes through the records of the medicine disposal system that the nurses used, she finds Charles having used a hack trick to take out multiple doses of insulin and Digoxin from the system. Charles had himself shown her this trick (when he got a tablet for Amy after she had a heart episode in the hospital), in which canceling the request to get the drugs after a particular point of time canceled the request in the records, but the machine disposed of the medicine anyway. She gives all this information to the investigators, but the fact that the request for the drugs was ultimately shown as canceled on the paper meant that Charles' trick could not be used in court.But these findings make it very evident that Charles Cullen used to tamper the IV fluid bags with insulin and Digoxin, killing the patients slowly over hours. They even exhume the body of the 2nd victim to prove that she died of insulin and Digoxin overdose.The investigators inform Parkfield hospital about all this as well, but the hospital's reaction is only to immediately fire Charles from his job, citing a minor error in the information he had provided about his earlier employment. It is certain that all the other hospitals where the man had worked had fired him in a similar manner the moment, they doubted he was doing something wrong. Without any care for justice or punishment, the hospitals merely wanted to avoid any accountability since they would come under heavy fire if an employee of theirs was found to be a serial killer. Now that Charles is fired from his job once again, the investigators have no way but to somehow make the man confess his own crimes, and for this, they approach Amy for help.Ever since Amy had heard of and started believing Charles for who he really was, she felt extremely nervous around the man for obvious reasons. But she had to keep up with the pretension of friendship with Charles since she was in a vulnerable spot, especially since he was close to her daughters as well and would visit them regularly. Even on the day that Charles is fired from the hospital, he visits Amy's house while she is not there, and she is terrified to see him alone with her daughters. Amy still keeps her fears to herself, though, and she helps the investigators by trying to make Charles admit his crimes on record. This does not work, and the man eventually lands a job at another hospital quickly. The investigators realize that this is too dangerous, and they arrest Charles, but they also remain fearful about the fact that he would have to be freed if no confession came in forty-eight hours.Charles Cullen denies having to say anything about his actions and acts rather frenzied by repeatedly shouting out that he cannot say anything. It is finally Amy who decides to help once again, and now she visits Charles at the police station and comforts him with kind words. This works great, as Charles seems ready to talk, and when Amy asks him why he had committed the acts, the man admits to having killed many patients but also says that he did not know why he had done so.Charles Cullen was actually a nurse arrested in 2003 after he admitted to having killed 29 patients by administering insulin and Digoxin overdoses. Experts and researchers have since then claimed the actual figure of his victims to be close to 400 since there was no way of knowing the exact number. Charles himself has at times stated in interviews that he committed the murders to save the patients from the sad plight of being mistreated by the hospital staff, but many of his victims were not even terminally ill. There can be little doubt about the fact that Charles had been affected by the mistreatment that his mother had received in a hospital, and this probably built in him a deep-rooted mistrust and insecurity against hospitals.""The Good Nurse"" ends with information about the real case, about how Charles Cullen was sentenced to eighteen consecutive life terms in prison in 2003 and remains in jail at present.",An infamous caregiver is implicated in the deaths of hundreds of hospital patients.

Cut to this same girl running down a city street, crying uncontrollably.In 2016, New York Times journalist Megan Twohey (Carey Mulligan) speaks with a young woman - Rachel - about speaking out against Donald Trump, who is running for president. The woman is hesitant and wants to know if the Times would cover her legal costs if she needs them after coming forward. Megan says they can't help with legal fees. The woman would be on her own but feels comfortable if another woman is on board as well. Then she agrees to go on record.New York Times Journalist Jodi Kantor (Zoe Kazan) juggles her two young daughters while getting ready for work. It's not easy.A pregnant Megan is sick in bed as her husband takes care of her while Jodi's husband leads them in a Jewish holiday prayer for their family. Megan receives a call from Trump. He denies the girls' accounts.A news story runs the next day- several women speaking out against Trump. It's everywhere. Megan's source, Rachel, is trapped inside her house. Cameramen are camped outside her house. Megan suggests writing things down and taping any conversations. An exhausted Megan gets a call from a woman calling for Bill O'Reilly. She wants to know if Megan thinks of herself as a feminist. Megan lets out a big sigh.Then Megan gets a threatening call from a man saying he will kill her and dump her body in the river. News anchors announce Trump wins the presidency as Fox News dismisses Bill O'Reilly. Jodi works with another reporter on women's claims of inappropriate nature. Her editor, Rebecca Corbett (Patricia Clarkson), commends her work.Jodi and Rebecca start a new topic - corporate misuse of power or workplaces where harassment might happen. Jodi speaks to the head of a feminist group who says the wrongdoing in Hollywood is overwhelming. Rose McGown tweeted about being raped by a producer, who the feminist head says is film producer Harvey Weinstein.Weinstein was accused by another Italian model who claimed Weinstein groped her in a business meeting several years ago. NYPD investigated it, but he was never charged. Jodi must track down and talk to Rose and other actresses he's worked with and ex-employees but gets nowhere.Megan and her husband are able to hear the heartbeat of their unborn child while Jodi continues to track down people who worked with or for Weinstein. Finally, Jodi gets a call from Rose, but she's not inclined to talk to the Times because of the way she's been treated by the paper in the past. Rose isn't willing to put herself on the line again because she's spoken up in the past and nothing ever changed. Jodi tells her she has written about Amazon, Starbucks, and Harvard Business School, and change happened as a result of her articles. Jodi's husband tries to talk about serious topics, but Jodi is really wrapped up in the workplace/ Weinstein research.She watches a clip of Ashley Judd at a rally. She reads an article Ashley wrote about being harassed in the 90s. Megan struggles with Postpartum depression, and her husband talks her through it.Rose McGown calls Jodi back and suggests Jodi expands beyond Weinstein. Hollywood is full of abusers, calling it ""white men on a playground."" Rose then tells her at a meeting, Weinstein talked projects with her and then mentioned he has a Jacuzzi in his room. She didn't know how to respond, so she just kept talking. Later, they were walking down the hallway, and he mentioned, ""this is the Jacuzzi room"" she didn't know what to say, but once he pushed her inside, he stripped her clothes off, and she had an out-of-body experience as he raped her. She went into survival mode to get out. He left messages saying she was his special friend.She didn't report it because she didn't think the police would take her side. She told people, but no one did a thing. Jodi wants to contact the people Rose told, but Rose warns Weinstein will have spies watching Jodi now.Jodi calls Megan at home. They discuss motherhood, and Jodi can tell Megan is struggling. Then they discuss how the women are finding it hard to talk to Jodi and go on the record. Jodi asks Megan how she got women to speak in the past, and Megan says though it's hard, and she can't change what happened to you in the past, but together we may be able to use what happened to you to help other people.Jodi talks to Ashley Judd over zoom. Ashley goes over how Weinstein harassed her. What was supposed to be a business meeting turned into Weinstein asking for a massage, then asking her to pick out his suit, getting closer and closer. Ashley could only say no so many different times in so many different ways. She got out of there fast. She told her dad, agent, and people she was filming with that day. Then she was stonewalled by others. Today she knows it was Weinstein making a phone call to have people ice her out of roles she was up for.Jodi receives an email from Lisa Bloom, daughter of feminist icon Gloria Allred. Turns out Weinstein and Jay-Z are producing a series based on Lisa's book. Jodi's colleague points out Weinstein must have had Lisa reach out to Jodi, which means Weinstein knows that Jodi's looking into his past.At work, Megan and Jodi discuss expanding the story to people who don't have a platform, unlike actresses. Megan suggests she can search for police complaints and court records against Miramax, Weinstein's producing company. Jodi and Megan team up to continue the story.Jodi and Megan have lunch, and Jodi says Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner want to help but then Megan gets a call from the investigator on the sexual harassment cases, but he doesn't know what Miramax is.Megan is able to track down an old assistant who disappeared from Miramax. Megan shows up at the woman's mother's house, but the woman is actually there. The woman immediately changes her demeanor. She starts to breathe fast and chooses her words wisely. ""All I can say is that I had a business dispute that was resolved amicably, and we've agreed not to discuss it."" Megan says in the past, they've written around NDAs, and sources can remain anonymous regardless of settlements. But the woman doesn't want to be involved.Jodi gets a call from Gwyneth Paltrow while Megan approaches the (former?) CFO of Miramax at his house. With his wife in the room, he has trouble dismissing Megan.Megan calls the equal employment opportunities commission to confirm which companies have the most sexual harassment complaints, but they can't help because it's confidential.Jodi meets Gwyneth at her house. We don't see Gwyneth but Jodi reports back to work that it's a pattern of behavior. Weinstein invited Gwyneth to the hotel under the guise of a ""business meeting"" and then threatened her with losing her job if she refused to have sex with Weinstein.They discover:
NDAs are rarely examined, barely come up in open court, and law schools don't teach them. Also, attorneys who represent the victims can get up to 40% of the settlement. Most sexual harassment cases are settled. The women must give over all diaries, emails, and recordings. It's cash for silence.Then Rebecca asks how close the women are to going on the record. The horrific hotel accounts without corroborating evidence won't help the story. The Times executive editor Dean (Andre Braugher) wants any comment from Weinstein to be on the record and tells Jodi and Megan to assume any conversation with him is being recorded.Next, we hear the Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierez's recording of the night Harvey Weinstein tried to coerce her into his hotel room.Megan calls a source who used to work at the D.A.'s office. She brings up that Weinstein wasn't charged on a certain case, and it was irregularly handled. The DA source says there wasn't any criminal conduct there. Megan pushed because there was a recording.Jodi gets a call from a panicked Gwyneth Paltrow. Weinstein has turned up to her house party. Gwyneth has locked herself in her own bathroom to avoid him. Jodi asks if Gwyneth feels she's in danger, but Gwyneth feels that Weinstein is sending a message that he's letting her know he knows.Jodi and Megan go to lunch with Rebecca. There they learn that Ronin Farrow is also working on a story about Weinstein. There, a man approaches them, trying to pick up one of the ladies. Megan tries to be polite, but the guy won't take no for an answer. Then Megan yells at him to go away, and that catches everyone in the restaurant's attention. She apologizes, but Jodi says no apology is necessary.Jodi meets an ex-Miramax assistant at an upscale restaurant. She becomes emotional and gives the names of two assistants and a third woman Jodi should talk to. Rowena Chung, Zelda Perkins, and Laura Madden. But they all live in London, Silicon Valley, and Wales. Rebecca tells Jodi they absolutely need documents and verification.Jodi goes to Rowena's house, but Rowena's husband is there doing yard work. Rowena isn't home. He's confused because Rowena never told him about her experiences with Weinstein. Jodi feels terrible for letting the cat out of the bag and immediately leaves.Jodi talks to Megan on the phone. She has hit another brick wall. A UK lawyer told her to don't bother with getting around NDAs because no one ever does it. Megan tells her to forget that guy, but she uses a different f-word.Jodi calls Laura Madden. However, Laura is having medical issues at this time. Her young children are really troubled by her diagnosis. Laura breaks down in her call with Jodi.Jodi has tea with Zelda in London. Zelda says people have tried to write this story before, but Weinstein always shut it down. Jodi assures her they will do everything, so that doesn't happen. Zelda discusses how she fended Harvey off with humor and regression. She would wear puffer jackets or sit in an armchair, not on a couch. Zelda can't share all her experiences at the Venice Film Festival because of the NDA. But one morning, Rowena came to Zelda in tears. She was crying uncontrollably. Zelda went to confront Weinstein, who was in a meeting with Scorsese. She walked straight up to him and said, ""You need to come with me right now,"" and he did. He denied it. He swore on his wife and children.Rowena and Zelda came back to London and resigned. They talked to a lawyer. Zelda told her direct superior, who suggested they get a good lawyer. But 20-year-olds don't know where to get lawyers, so they feel overwhelmed. Called a firm close to the office, but they said the girls had no chance, no case, no police report from Venice, and no evidence. The lawyers kept saying a settlement was the only way to go because, with rape, it is impossible to get a prosecution.Zelda insisted no money should change hands. But the girls would sign on certain conditions: 1- If Weinstein had another settlement within two years, it would have to be reported to Disney, or else he would be fired. 2- He would go to therapy with Zelda present initially so that he couldn't lie. 3- H.R. would assign an assistant to protect the women on the staff. If the girls could achieve those, that was what their silence was paying for.The Weinstein Company had its own conditions, but the girls had to remember them because they wouldn't give them their own copies. Only visitation rights to their settlements. 1- the girls wouldn't help the police in a criminal or civil case. 2- They couldn't talk to their families or therapists about their experiences.Zelda interviewed for jobs after, but everyone would only say, ""why did you leave Harvey?"" She would never work in the entertainment industry again. She moved to Guatemala and worked with horses. Zelda then gives Jodi all the documents she had.Jodi talks to her daughters over zoom. It's been challenging while she's been in the U.K., but her oldest daughter asks her what she is reporting on. Jodi doesn't feel comfortable sharing this topic with such a young girl, and then her daughter asks if it's about rape. Jodi asks her where she learned that ""grown-up"" word. The daughter says schoolmates say it often and apologizes. Jodi says she doesn't have to apologize because she did nothing wrong. Even though Jodi is trying to protect her daughter from the cruel world, its ugliness still shows up.Laura Madden gets a call from an old colleague who asks if she's been approached by ""roach"" reporters. The colleague says working for Harvey in the past was great, and if Laura had a project, the colleague could bring it to Harvey now. Laura picks up what the lady is lying down and says she'll talk to whom she pleases and hangs up.Laura arranges a meeting with Jodi, who hops on a train the next day. Laura was a production assistant in the 1990s. She was assigned to Weinstein. One morning he asked for a massage while he was naked. She turned him down. He said it's not sexual, and all the girls do it. It's just work. He then commanded her to take her top off, bra off, and trousers off. Then Laura asked him to leave her alone. But he carried on. Next, he's in the shower, touching himself. And her crying annoyed him. She ran out of there, and we're taken to the beginning of the film. Laura is the P.A. running down a city street, crying uncontrollably.She carried on with such shame, and she assumed other girls were stronger to refuse him. It was like he took her voice that day, just as she was finding it.Back in New York, Weinstein calls the Times. Dean suggests Weinstein talk to the reporters on the record. Weinstein mentions he loves the truth.The reporters, lawyers, and editors regroup. The documents from Zelda are the most significant thing, but no one can go on the record because of their NDAs, and the famous actresses aren't ready to go on the record even though they didn't sign NDAs.Megan and Jodi meet with Weinstein's lawyer, Lanny Davis, at the Times offices. He acknowledges that men these days are learning what consensual actually means, including Harvey. The lawyer talks a little too much, which leads Megan to ask a question that the lawyer doesn't know how to answer. He needs to figure out what his legal options are. She asked, ""how many settlements?""Jodi gets a call in the middle of the night. The woman only says, ""I used to work at Miramax. Talk to Irwin Reiter."" The next scene shows Jodi with Reiter, and she asks Reiter if he can confirm the settlements and if company money was used. Before Reiter leaves, he asks why she is so interested in the 90s settlements when there's been so many recently. This is a revelation Jodi wasn't expecting.Megan heard that Ambra Battilana Gutierrez got a seven-figure settlement, and Weinstein now owns the recording. Megan questions Lanny Davis about it. He confirms that it's eight to twelve settlements.Megan and Jodi talk about their nightmares and sleepless nights and worry about whether or not people will care once the story runs. However, neither regret signing up for this story.Jodi meets again with Reiter. She asks for proof of the settlements. He doesn't help her.Rowena calls Jodi out of the blue. They meet in New York. Rowena grew up in a Chinese household which prioritized protecting the family. Late one night while working for Weinstein, Rowena and he was going over scripts and notes. He made it a game, held her down, and begged for ""just one thrust."" She ran out of there and went to Zelda's room. Like Zelda, she couldn't find work again. Rowena agreed to take a job in Hong Kong for the Weinstein Company, but her trauma changed her. She tried to commit suicide.Jodi meets with Reiter again. Without naming the actress, she shows him a document with a detailed account of how Weinstein assaulted her. He didn't think it was anything like that.He brings up a memo on his phone and leaves for the restroom, and tells her, ""do with it what you want."" Jodi starts taking multiple pictures of it with her phone. It's an internal memo that circulated at Miramax in 2015 detailing abuse allegations against Weinstein from a former employee.Jodi reads the memo from Lauren O'Conner. She is an ex-Miramax employee who wrote the board. In it, she details her account and Weinstein's abuse of power. Rebecca talks with Lauren's attorney. They plan to use Lauren's name in the article for credibility though they will say Lauren is not the source of the memo.Jodi and Megan begin to write the story. They plan to tell their sources publication is imminent. And they reach out to the Weinstein company for comment.Jodi reaches out to Ashley Judd again. Ideally, a group of women jumping together would be best, but that's not what's happening. They do have a mountain of evidence and predatory pattern.
Yet, Ashley would be coming forward alone. Ashley promises to think about it seriously.Jodi vents to Megan her frustration of not being able to convince just one woman to go on the record. The group waits for two hours for a call from Weinstein and his lawyer. Weinstein wants to know who they have talked to, especially if they talked to Gwyneth.Ashley Judd calls Jodi while finishing her run in the mountains. She agrees to be named in the article, which brings Jodi to tears.The lead of the article now is Ashley Judd's account of the Peninsula hotel. They publish as soon as the piece is in good shape. Everything comes together, and they get confirmation of eight to twelve settlements though Lanny Davis writes up a response that could be a novel.Weinstein shows up at the Times offices. In the conference room, the group deals with an irate Weinstein. Weinstein and the company try to discredit the actresses with statements in Variety and Hollywood Reporter. He claims to be surprised by the Times article. And keeps asking if Gwyneth Paltrow is in the article and if they have talked to Gwyneth.Laura Madden calls Jodi before she goes in for surgery. She also agrees to be named in the article since she didn't sign an NDA. She's speaking out for the women who can't speak for themselves.The Times publishes the article on October 5, 2017. Follow-up articles are published. Other women come forward with more allegations against Weinstein. There is a global shift in attitudes, and the rise of the Me Too movement places a spotlight on this behavior.",Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey's quest to break the Harvey Weinstein scandal.

As he kills an older female and an adolescent male vampire at a house where he supposedly gets hired to clean the pool, he harvests their fangs as they're worth good money.A lower-level criminal vampire named Sasha is seen being tortured by Audrey San Fernando (Karla Souza), who is also revealed to be a vampire and claims to have ""big plans"" with the Los Angeles area and its vampire population. The camera pans to a sign by a development project, revealing her to be a rich and powerful real estate magnate.Bud goes home to his apartment and is revealed to have financial issues as he's behind on rent. He takes a shower and picks up his daughter Paige (Zion Broadnax) from school. Although technically still married to her mother Jocelyn (Meagan Good), they do live apart from each other. Bud takes Paige to a frozen yogurt place and brings her home late.Jocelyn reveals that she's taking Paige to her mother's in Florida. Heartbroken at the thought of losing his daughter, Bud pleads with her to give him time until Monday. He hopes that selling his newly harvested vampire fangs will net him around 10,000 dollars, enough to pay for Paige's braces and other various expenses. As his lies in the past were the reason she and Bud went their separate ways, Jocelyn is very skeptical he will follow through with his promise, but she gives him a chance.Bud visits Troy (Peter Stormare), a dodgy pawn shop owner. Troy only offers him a fraction of what Bud knows he can get for the fangs at the vampire hunting organization known as ""The Union"", from which it is revealed Bud was expelled. Needing the money by Monday, Bud texts his old friend Big John Elliott (Snoop Dogg) in the hopes he can get him in.Audrey threatens her business partner that he may meet with the same fate as Sasha if he backs out of their deal. She also reveals she has a ""product"" that will allow vampires to walk in daylight. She and her henchman Klaus (Oliver Masucci) visit the house where Bud killed the two vampires. It is revealed the old woman was dear to her heart, and she swears to take revenge on whoever destroyed her.Big John meets Bud outside the Union and they meet with Ralph Seeger (Eric Lange), the curmudgeonly director who has no intention of allowing Bud back in due to his numerous prior code violations. After a great deal of convincing, Seeger allows Bud to work the day shift, which is considered second rate to the much more profitable (and dangerous) night shift.Bud and Big John head downstairs to the financial department to get payment for Bud's fangs. Cashier Seth (Dave Franco) gives him a handsome fee at first, but reduces it to a mere fraction after withholding several fees. Wanting to be promoted to his superior Carol's position, Seth is told by Seeger to partner up with Bud and report any code violations he makes in an attempt to get him out. Seth reluctantly agrees.Seth displays a great amount of theoretical knowledge about vampires, leaving Bud visibly impressed but not wanting to show it. Meanwhile, Audrey visits Troy to intimidate him, and ends up killing him.On their first mission together, Seth is told by Bud to stay in the car, but gets a call from Seeger, who tells him to get inside and verify any code violations. Horrified by the vampire slaughter, Seth wets himself and vomits outside the car. Bud, developing a soft spot for Seth, drives him home. After arriving home himself, Bud meets and welcomes Heather (Natasha Liu Bordizzo), a new tenant in his building, who claims to work as a nurse.The next day, Bud finds out Seth has been writing him up for several code violations. They go into Troy's pawn shop and find him dead with all of his teeth pulled and out on the desk. Bud then reveals he needs the money to keep his family. Seth promises not to report to Seeger.On their next mission, Bud and Seth meet with the Nazarian Brothers, famed hunters who pose as stereo repairmen. Together, they clear out a vampire nest, and the mystery product from before is revealed to be a ""vampire sunscreen"", allowing them to be out in the sun for fifteen to twenty minutes. Seth notices the nest contains several different types of vampires that would never choose to live together. Bud agrees he has a point, but has to run to pick up Paige from school.Having an uneasy feeling, Bud asks Paige if she'd like to stay in after they return home. Jocelyn reminds him that she's been looking forward to attending a birthday party for the past week now, and that he has to take her. Reluctanctly, he does.At the party, Bud gets a phone call from Audrey and she threatens to kidnap his wife and daughter. He gets Paige in the car as quickly as possible and immediately gets pursued by Audrey's goons. He slits one of their throats in the parking lot and gets involved in an adrenaline-pumping car chase as Paige plays with her iPad in the back seat.When Bud gets Paige back home to Jocelyn, he is ambushed by Audrey and her goons. He reveals his secret to his wife and daughter and tells them he is a vampire hunter.Bud gets knocked out and when he wakes up, it's revealed Seth was bitten and turned into a vampire. Because he cannot control his hunger, Seth lunges at Bud, who cuts his head off. Because he was turned by an ""über Vampire"", Seth's condition is still unstable, however, and cutting his head off doesn't kill him.As Bud heads back to his apartment complex, he goes to find Heather as she is the only person he has confided with. It turns out Heather is also a vampire turned by Audrey, and she and Bud fight briefly. Heather then reveals that the elderly vampire Bud destroyed is in fact Audrey's daughter, who wasn't turned until after she got old in ""human years"".Audrey and Klaus take Jocelyn and Paige to an underground temple lair. In the meantime, Heather reveals that Audrey wants to flood the Valley with vampires and facilitate them by buying property all over the area.Bud, Seth and Heather go to an abandoned shopping mall and easily dispatch of some of Audrey's goons. When they get surrounded, Big John arrives and mows down dozens of them with his mini gun.Bud and John go into the underground compound and find vampires working in a production facility for ""vampire sunscreen"". They dispatch of them. Meanwhile, Klaus smells Bud's presence and alerts Audrey. As Bud and John go deeper into the underground lair, they get ambushed by a pack of vampires and John gets bitten. He closes the gate behind Bud and tells him to go ahead and find his wife and child. With Bud out of sight, John empties the clip of his gun on the approaching vampires and then detonates an explosive around his belt, sacrificing himself and killing his enemies.Klaus confronts Bud, but Heather and Seth come in crashing through the roof and tell him to go ahead and find Paige and Jocelyn. They begin to fight Klaus, but he effortlessly gets the better of them in combat.Bud finds Paige and Jocelyn with Audrey and also gets bested in combat. Just as she wants to deliver the killing bite, Paige stabs her through the heart from behind with a wooden stake. It doesn't seem to phase Audrey, however, and she snaps it off. She throws both Jocelyn and Bud across the room.With Seth and Heather being held in a choke hold by Klaus, they join forces and pull his arms off, defeating him.With the wooden stake still in Audrey's heart, Bud shoots his last silver bullet at her neck in an attempt to finish her. However, she catches it between her teeth. As she runs towards Bud to finish him off, he closes his eyes, seemingly at peace with his imminent demise. However, a slicing noise reveals that Audrey has run into his wire trap, decapitating her. As her severed head mocks Bud one last time, Audrey is destroyed.After the final battle, everyone heads back upstairs where they meet a distraught Seeger.

Suddenly, he is shoved down the stairs for an unknown reason. He is noticeably injured, but his father is relived that he does not need stitches. His father assumes he fell.An unknown amount of time later, but suggested that maybe later that night or the next, Kevin wakes up in the middle of the night by a loud noise. He wakes up his sister, Kaylee, a similarly aged young girl. They turn on the lights of their respective upstairs bedrooms and walk into the hallway to investigate. After a few moments of investigating the upstairs floor, they call out for their father, who does not respond. They shrug off this issue, assuming their father will be back soon.Excited by the prospect of their father not being home, Kaylee suggests sleeping downstairs in the living room. Downstairs, they set up their bedspreads on the couches of the living room and build a Lego village on the floor in front of the TV. They TV plays old VHS cartoons, especially properties such as Betty Boop and Disney-like animation accompanied by classic cartoon soundtracks, which play throughout the entire film. After playing for a while, they decide to investigate the rest of the house, which is seemingly operating with limited power. They discover that night lights have been unplugged, phone lines have been disconnected, and all the windows and doors of the home have disappeared.Later that night Kaylee asks Kevin where their parents could be, however Kevin is noticeably uncomfortable by the mention of their mother, and asks that Kaylee does not bring her up again. Later they continue playing with Lego's and hear a sudden loud noise coming from the adjoining dining room. Now possessing a flashlight, they investigate to find a chair now standing upside down on the ceiling. They are clearly disturbed, but shrug it off before returning to their leisure in the living room before falling asleep.After waking up, Kaylee calls Kevin into the downstairs bathroom, pointing out that the toilet has now disappeared. They collect two buckets as a remedy, but not before stating how gross this is. Later that day or night (they have completely lost track of time), Kaylee hears a voice coming from the dark hallway next to the living room, which beckons her to go upstairs. She follows, which leads her to her parents' bedroom. The voice whispers to look under the bed, where she sees nothing, but when she looks up she finds a female figure sitting on the bed, which she assumes is her mother. The ""mother"" asks Kaylee to close her eyes, which she obeys, when she opens them she finds that the figure is gone, just before the room erupts in a sharp, high frequency noise and blinding light before immediately falling dark again.An indefinite amount of time later, Kaylee has joined her brother in the living room again. Kevin asks what happened upstairs, but Kaylee does not respond. However, Kaylee insists on moving one of the couches to block entry/exit into the dark adjoining hallway where the voice originated. Later that night, while the two sleep, the cartoon on the TV begins to repeat a scene where a character preforms an illusion where they make themselves disappear. While doing so, the stuffed dolls of both children begin to disappear.The next day/night the voice returns, asking that both children go downstairs to the basement. Kevin, still adorning the flashlight lead his sister into the basement. Soon after, the flashlight loses power. The two young children immediately start to lose composure and get lost in the darkness. Kevin calls out to Kaylee, with no answer. Suddenly the flashlight regains power, only to immediately shine on Kaylee's face, which has now lost both their eyes and mouth and are instead covered by skin.Kevin is now alone in the living room. While he tries to survive, more and more items begin to shift towards the ceiling and other walls in the house. Kevin does not seem to care. The voice comes from the hallway again, but this time commanding that Kevin retrieves a knife from the kitchen, and stab his eye out. The camera then cuts to different rooms around the house while a child's scream erupts, seemingly no less terrifying and loud depending on the room or floor.Now in horrible, severe pain, Kevin attempts to use the phone again, and is surprised to see that it works. He calls 911, where an operator on the other line asks questions about his location and condition, and that Kevin stays on the line until other ""grown ups"" can come and help. Kevin responds, saying that he ""is cut and feeling sick"". The operator asks for his location, where Kevin responds that ""The doors are gone"" before dropping the home phone on the floor and leaving the room.Later, Kevin calls out to the voice, asking what happened to Kaylee. The voice responds, saying that Kaylee did not do as she was told therefore, her mouth was ""removed"". Soon after, the voice whispers that Kevin needs to come upstairs. He obeys, and soon starts to lose power with his flashlight. To remedy this situation, he turns the flashlight on and off sporadically to save battery. After multiple instances of turning the flashlight on and off, he finds himself standing on the ceiling of the second floor of the house. He calls out for Kaylee and his mother, before being pulled around a corner by an unknown being. From the corner, blood sprays and pours out while Kevin calls out for his ""mommy"". The shot plays then reverses again multiple times. A door is shown in the pitch darkness, but does not open.Later, Kevin's toy radio is seen suspended and sitting upright of the upstairs hallway ceiling, defying gravity. This is surrounded by his other Lego's and bulling toys. The radio plays the cartoon theme music from earlier. It is revealed that it has been roughly a year and a half since the previous events. The camera fades out, showing that the hallway its infinite and continues until the radio and Lego stack are out of sight.Kevin, who is revealed to have survive the previous events, has gained control of his flashlight again. In the darkness, he makes out a face that stares at him with an absent expression. He calls out to it, asking for its name, to no response. He asks again, but the figure does not respond instead electing to stare at him in the darkness.THE END.","Two children wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing, and all the windows and doors in their home have vanished."

The caves are very deep. Chamber 3 is 800 m from the entrance. Suddenly, it starts raining and the save starts filling up with water. The rains are totally unexpected and nonseasonal and catches the team off guard. Its well known that the caves flood in the monsoons.
When the team fail to arrive at a birthday party organized by their parents, their families head to the caves, only to find them flooded and the boys missing, their bikes left at the entrance. The parents immediately alert emergency services. word reaches Governor Narongsak Osatanakorn (Sahajak Boonthanakit), who deploys the Thai Navy Seals.Royal Thai Navy SEALs, led by Captain Arnont (Teerapat Sajakul), arrive to search for the missing boys, but find the dive too difficult to locate the team. Vernon Unsworth (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), a local British caver, shares his extensive knowledge of the complex and dangerous cave (he had mapped the entire cave extensively on paper) and suggests the authorities get in touch with the British Cave Rescue Council. The first rescue attempt reaches chamber 3 and has to turn back when they encounter a flash flood.
DAy 2, more agencies get mobilized and the effort is to pump water out of the caves. The attempts are futile as there are many sinkholes on the mountain which are feeding water all over the caves.. The pumps are not fast enough.
Thousands of Thai and international volunteers join the rescue effort to help in anyway they can. A temp base is set up in Chamber 3.Day 5. British cavers Rick Stanton (Viggo Mortensen) and John Volanthen (Colin Farrell) attempt the dive (They reach the stalactite tunnel 900 ms from the entrance. They get to T junction 1600 M from the entrance in 3 hrs and 49 mins). Mid way through the dive they find a stranded rescuer who was trying to fix the pumps and John takes him back to Chamber 3 from where he is taken to safety. John and Rick return from T junction, which is also till where the Thai Navy seals had gotten to and had already laid guide lines up to that place.
Day 7, and there is still no sign of the boys or their coach. The governor holds a meeting of all teams. the Navy seals wants the rain to stop before going back in. John and Rick offer to go in then and now. The governor decides to hold back the divers till the rains stop.
Meanwhile, as hundreds of volunteers try to mitigate poor weather conditions, a water technician from Bangkok (who has discovered all the sinkholes on the mountains, which are filling up the caves, and can block them with the help of the locals) gains the permission of local farmers to divert water from the mountain onto their fields, destroying their crop.Day 9, the rains finally give a break. The governor decides to send in Rick and John as the Navy seals still need 24 hrs for prep. The guys reach T junction and start laying their own guide lines. Eventually, they find the boys and coach in chamber 9, about 2500 ms from the entrance (total dive time of 6 hrs and 12 mins). Rick and John find all 13 of the missing boys and coach alive.
Rick is distraught as he knows that if the Thai wait for the water to be pumped out, the boys will never come out alive. The kids are likely to panic on the 2.5 km dive back and are very likely to get injured or die. Still Rick and John brief the Thai Navy seals on the route beyond T junction.
Day 11. The Thai team delivers some food and medicines to the boys. But they use too much O2 coming in and now only one of them can get out safely. The O2 in chamber 9 is only 16% and dropping quickly.
Day 12. The parents start losing patience and still the Thai teams have no clue as to how to get the boys out.Realising the boys will have to be removed through the cave, via a 6 hour dive, Stanton and Volanthen contact Dr. Richard Harris (Joel Edgerton), plus supporting divers Chris Jewell (Tom Bateman) and Jason Mallinson (Paul Gleeson). They work with the Thai teams to deliver food to the stranded boys on Day 14.
Day 15. In an attempt to deliver wet-suits to the boys in preparation for the rescue, former Thai Navy Seal Saman Kunan drowns (Sukollawat Kanarot).
Harris is not sure as too much anesthetic and the boys can die of respiratory failure, too little and they wake up underwater and drown.Day 16. With permission from the regional governor and minister, the divers sedate the boys and, with one diver per boy, carry each member out of the cave safely. Day 16, 4 boys are carried out. The boys have to given injections for sedatives every half hr. Harris was expecting casualties, but all the boys make it through. Under immense secrecy the 4 rescued boys are taken to a city hospital. The govt doesn't want to release any details to the media or the parents till the rescue operation is complete.
Day 17, 5 more boys are rescued. The monsoon clouds are gathering over the mountains and time is running out fast.
Day 18, the remaining boys are carried out. The coach is removed last.Removed to hospital, the parents are reunited with the team. The end scene is the boys celebrating the birthday party that was supposed to happen on the day they went into the cave. The end credits reveal that the coach and three of the boys, who were all stateless, are given Thai citizenship.
The film is dedicated to Saman Kunan, the Thai Navy Seal who died while resupplying air tanks on July 6, 2018. The credits also mention another Navy Seal, Beirut Pakbara, who later died from a blood infection.

After Drea's car fails to start, Eleanor offers her a ride and tells her about also becoming an outcast when a false rumor spread she forcibly kissed Carissa (Ava Capri), another Rosehill student, at a summer camp years earlier. This was after she had confessed to Carissa that she was a lesbian.Eleanor befriends Max's sister Gabbi at school. Drea learns that Max has started dating Tara. To humiliate her further, Max apologizes to Drea for her video in front of the entire school assembly and launches a new club in her honor. When Drea and Eleanor realize they will not get justice on their own, they devise a plan to exact revenge on the other's rival: Drea on Carissa and Eleanor on Max. Following a makeover, Eleanor slowly infiltrates Drea's old clique while Drea tries to get close to Carissa by volunteering at the school farm and befriends Russ (RIsh Shah), a fellow student. Eleanor is invited to a pool party thrown by Max, where she discovers he is cheating on his new girlfriend, Tara (Alisha Boe) (with Allegra, the Instagram witch).

She tells her husband Jonathan ""Johnny"" Loughran (Andy Samberg) who excitedly tells Dracula his plans to renovate the hotel. Worried about Johnny ruining the hotel (Johnny has a good intention but has a tendency to cause accidents and leads to injuries to guests and workers of the hotel), Dracula lies to him saying that there is a real-estate law which only lets monsters own the hotel, disappointing Johnny.Other staff of the hotel includes Blobby (Genndy Tartakovsky), a green blob monster. Party Monster (Richard Tyler ""Ninja"" Blevins). Frankenstein, Wayne, Griffin, Murray, Wanda (Molly Shannon), a werewolf and Wayne's wife, Eunice (Fran Drescher), Frankenstein's wife.Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan) (former monster hunter and Ericka's great-grandfather who invented the ""Monsterfication Ray"") decides to help Johnny using a ray that turns people into monsters and the other way around as well; after testing it on his guinea pig Gigi, he uses it on Johnny who turns into a dragon-like monster. Learning about monster Johnny, Dracula tries to turn him back to normal, but accidentally turns himself into a human and breaks the ray's crystal. Van Helsing tells Dracula and Johnny that they can still turn themselves back to normal by getting a new crystal which lies in a cave in South America, so Dracula and Johnny set off to do so.
Dracula doesn't want to reveal the events to Mavis or Ericka and keeps Johnny away from them as well, before they embark upon their trip. In a role reversal Johnny enjoys travelling as a monster, and Dracula is now a mortal and is petrified at being in a human world.Dracula's friends Frank (Brad Abrell) (Frankenstein, Eunice's husband), Wayne (Steve Buscemi) (a werewolf and Wanda's husband), Griffin (David Spade) (An invisible man) and Murray (Keegan-Michael Key) (An ancient Mummy) end up becoming humans as well, as a result of drinking from a fountain that was contaminated by the ray. Mavis and Dracula's wife, Ericka Van Helsing (Kathryn Hahn) confront Van Helsing after learning about Dracula and Johnny's whereabouts in the news, but he warns them about the effects of the ray, as people who become monsters continue to mutate and become more hostile as time goes on (based on the observations of the effect of the ray on Gigi). With this in mind, the rest of the gang head to South America to find Dracula and Johnny.While traveling through the South American jungle (Johnny likes hiking as it is really easy for him, but Dracula finds it very hard now that he doesn't have any of special powers like super strength or ability to fly. He has pollen allergies, is attacked by piranha in the river, is bitten by mosquitoes, none of which effects Johnny anymore), Dracula and Johnny begin to bond (Dracula teaches Johnny how to use his wings to fly), and Dracula eventually begins to confess that he lied about the monster real-estate law, but the rest of the group find them (Mavis uses her sonar powers to locate them in the jungle after Ericka gets the whole gang there on her blimp). Things turn sour when Dracula admits his deception regarding passing over the hotel to Mavis and Johnny. This prompts an upset Johnny to believe Dracula does not consider him family and to mutate further (and more and more enraged) before running away.Mavis goes to find Johnny while Dracula and the rest of the gang go to find the crystal. Mavis finds Johnny, but the transformation has turned him very volatile. She leads him to the cave (by enraging Johnny by hitting him with rocks) where they finally find the crystal. When Mavis tries to turn Johnny back to normal, nothing happens due to him being too frenzied. In desperation, Dracula lets himself get captured by Johnny and goes on a remorseful tangent about how wrong he was about Johnny and how he now sees the best in him, finally acknowledging him as family. This brings Johnny back to his senses, and he is returned to human form.With Dracula and his friends turned back to normal, they return home only to find the hotel has been destroyed by Gigi. After turning Gigi back to normal, Dracula bemoans his loss. He soon decides to let Mavis and Johnny rebuild to their liking.
A year later, Mavis and Johnny show Dracula the re-built Hotel Transylvania, which he comes to enjoy.","After one experiment, Johnny turns into a monster and everyone else becomes human. Now it has to be seen whether they will be able to reverse this experiment."

Nate reunites with his old friend, Martin Battles (Sharlto Copley), a biologist and Mopani manager, who introduced Nate and his wife Amalhe (Naledi Mogadime). Martin takes Nate and the girls to the village where Nate's wife grew up. Nate confides to Martin his guilt over being distant following his and his wife's separation, after which she developed terminal cancer. Meredith blames Nate for abandoning them when their mother was going through cancer.
The trip is to reconnect with his daughters.The next day, Martin and the family tour the reserve's restricted areas. Martin shows them a local lion pride and notices that one is injured. This is a pride that Martin has raised since they were cubs.
At a nearby Tsonga community, Martin discovers most of the population is dead. Suspecting a rogue, man-killing lion is responsible, Martin rushes back to the nearest rangers station to report the finding. Nate & Martin encounter an injured Tsonga man on the road but are unable to save him. Martin is mauled as he tracks the lion with his gun. It then ambushes Nate, who takes cover in the car. Meredith speeds the car away but crashes into a tree, stranding them.Martin radios Nate on a Walkie-talkie, warning him to stay away, saying the lion is using Martin as bait to lure the others out. As the radio is out of range to contact help, Nate assembles a tranquilizer rifle. He confronts the lion, hoping to subdue it long enough to recover Martin and trek back to civilization.
The lion attacks, and Meredith takes advantage of the distraction to save Martin. Nate is knocked off the top of the car and takes refuge under the car. As the lion attacks Nate by trying to get under the car, Norah stabs the lion with a tranquilizer dart from inside the car, after it knocks the gun from Nate's hands. This causes the lion to retreat.

Soon after, the poachers arrive and initially agree to transport the group to the village in exchange for payment. Tensions rise after the poachers spot Martin, an avid anti-poacher, inside the car.
The lion attacks and scatters the poachers, killing most of them. Nate maneuvers his way past the lion and finds the poachers' truck keys. Back at the car, Martin holds the lion off long enough to allow the sisters to escape, though Meredith sustains a deep laceration to her side. The car falls into a ravine and Martin sacrifices himself by setting off an explosion from the leaking gasoline, severely burning the lion. Nate starts the truck and races away with Meredith and Norah but has to stop the car before they run out of fuel. They leave the car and walk to an abandoned schoolhouse nearby. On the way they had passed the pride of lions that Martin had raised from cubs.At the abandoned schoolhouse, which the poachers used as their base, Nate treats Meredith's wound and forages for water.

The next day, she is confronted by Martha, who tells her that she and Seth felt abandoned when Stephanie became popular back in high school. Martha says that she is gay, and this made high school a living hell for her.Stephanie decides to attend a showing of Deep Impact with Seth (as Tiffany had posted on Insta that the Natural History Museum was offering 20% discounts and that she and Blaine were going to be there themselves), and they get closer after goading Tiffany into being thrown out of the showing. Afterwards, they go to the Rock N Bowl and Stephanie confesses that she wants to be elected prom queen so badly because she wants to make her mother proud.Tiffany uses Bri's influence at school to get the prom king and queen contest reinstated (she tells Bri that she wants her to beat Stephanie at prom queen), and invites everyone at school except Stephanie to a prom after-party at their house (Steve Aoki is scheduled to DJ at the party). Stephanie decides to host her own after-party at Martha's family lake house without her knowledge. Seth agrees to go to prom with Stephanie but is hurt when he sees Blaine attempt to kiss her. Bri's boyfriend Lance (Michael Cimino) becomes prom king, and although Tiffany rigs the vote so Bri will win, Bri drops out so that Stephanie is the prom queen. Bri didn't like Tiffany trying to control her life and went against her.As Stephanie and Lance share the prom king and queen dance, the school rallies around her. Bri tells everyone to attend Stephanie's after-party, which is successful until Tiffany gets the police to shut it down. Martha angrily confronts Stephanie for using her lake house without asking. On the way home from the party, Stephanie realizes her ride-share driver is Deanna Russo, who explains that being prom queen did not give her a perfect life and she is now struggling to make ends meet.

Bri tells her mother that she knows she is in an unhappy marriage ruined by her desire to be popular and forces her to apologize to Stephanie. Stephanie accepts Tiffany's apology and encourages her to focus more on her daughter instead of keeping up appearances.Stephanie contemplates not attending graduation, but her father convinces her to attend. Streaming an apology to her followers and friends, she promises to be her true self from now on. At graduation, her friends secretly organize the cheer routine from Stephanie's senior year. She makes up with Martha, finally kisses Seth, and welcomes Tiffany to join them on stage.","A cheerleading stunt gone wrong landed her in a 20-year coma. Now she's 37, newly awake and ready to live out her high school dream: becoming prom queen."

After Köpernick's drunken behaviour towards the female lead Sheila Sim leads to a fistfight with her husband and co-star Richard Attenborough, Köpernick is killed backstage by an unseen assailant.Inspector Stoppard investigates the murder, shadowed by the inexperienced Constable Stalker. Everyone at the theatre is declared a suspect and a potential victim, including the play's producer Petula Spencer and Woolf's wife Edana Romney. Stoppard attempts to close the theatre until the murder is solved, but the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Harold Scott, intervenes, assigning Stalker to assist in the investigation.Stoppard and Stalker search Köpernick's room at the Savoy Hotel, finding his address book of women's details. The hotel manager recalls Köpernick's violent argument with screenwriter Mervyn Cocker-Norris, who admits to arguing with Köpernick over the director's vision for an action-packed ending for The Mousetrap film. Mervyn, who lives with his hot-headed ""nephew"" Gio, remembers a ""plain woman"" arriving at the hotel with Köpernick's son.Stoppard and Stalker question Woolf, who was blackmailed by Köpernick after he discovered Woolf's affair with his assistant, Ann. Dennis, an usher at the theatre, offers an unhelpful description of a suspicious figure; Attenborough and Sim are questioned as well. Spencer explains that she optioned The Mousetrap's film rights to Woolf, but he would be contractually unable to produce the adaptation until the show had closed.At a pub, Stoppard bonds with Stalker and reveals that his unfaithful wife left him after having a child with another man. Driving a drunken Stoppard home, Stalker finds news articles and a picture of his ex-wife, fitting Mervyn's description of a ""homely woman with glasses"". Combined with Dennis' description, this leads Stalker to suspect Stoppard may be the killer, and she searches for his ex-wife in Köpernick's address book.Stoppard and Stalker attend a performance of The Mousetrap, during which Mervyn, Woolf, Dennis, Gio and Stoppard leave the auditorium; Stalker soon follows after watching Stoppard retrieve his gloves. In the foyer, Mervyn is strangled to death by a gloved figure. Stalker spots Stoppard kneeling over the body and gives chase, knocking him unconscious with a snow shovel.Stoppard awakens in a cell, and Stalker and Scott accuse him of carrying out the murders. Stalker has summoned Joyce, the mother of Köpernick's son, but she is not Stoppard's ex-wife, exonerating him. Stalker escorts Joyce and her son home, and Joyce mentions overhearing a man with a ""village idiot"" accent. Reading through Mervyn's research on The Mousetrap, Stoppard realises the identity of the killer and races to the suspect's apartment, where Stalker has already burst inside and found the necessary evidence: the killer is Dennis.Attenborough, Sim, Woolf, Ann, Spencer and her elderly mother arrive at the home of Agatha Christie in Wallingford, Berkshire, having received invitations to dinner. The butler Fellowes is perplexed by their arrival, but Christie's husband, Max Mallowan, allows them inside. The group are held at gunpoint by Dennis, whom Spencer's mother recognises as Dennis Corrigan, an abused child whose brother's death inspired the plot of The Mousetrap. Dennis explains that he killed Köpernick and Mervyn in an attempt to stop the play and its adaptation, disgusted by the exploitation of his brother's tragedy for entertainment.Having forged the invitations to lure everyone together, Dennis has captured Edana, mistaking her for Christie. Christie enters with tea, including a poisoned cup for Dennis which Fellowes inadvertently drinks instead. An armed Stoppard arrives and a shootout ensues; Sim distracts Dennis with a molotov cocktail, and Stalker nearly takes a bullet to save Stoppard, matching Köpernick's story pitch, before Agatha dispatches Dennis with a shovel. It is revealed that the bullet did, in fact, hit Stoppard. Some time later, Stalker passes her sergeant's exams and a recovering Stoppard receives the King's Police and Fire Services Medal, and they attend another performance of The Mousetrap together.","In the West End of 1950s London, plans for a movie version of a smash-hit play come to an abrupt halt after a pivotal member of the crew is murdered."

This is that movie.
A human spacecraft searches for habitable planets 4.3 M light years from Earth. When it detects a possible planet, the craft wakes up its commander from cryogenic sleep.
Buzz Lightyear (Chris Evans), a Space Ranger in Star Command, alongside his commanding officer and best friend, Alisha Hawthorne (Uzo Aduba), explore the habitable planet, T'Kani Prime, with their new recruit, Featheringhamstan (Bill Hader). They are forced to retreat to their exploration vessel after discovering that the planet hosts hostile lifeforms. Buzz damages the vessel during the retreat (he takes off at the wrong angle (as the ship was tied down by vines coming out of the ground), thereby hitting the top of a nearby mountain during its ascent), forcing the crew to evacuate in order to conduct repairs and continue their journey. The hyperspace crystal of the ship is destroyed.One year later, the crew have constructed a nascent colony along with the necessary infrastructure to conduct repairs. They even manufacture a new hyperspace crystal, but it needs to be tested before it can be deployed. Buzz volunteers to test hyperspace fuel, a key component of the repairs. I.V.A.N. (Mary McDonald-Lewis), a voice-activated virtual assistant is Buzz's autopilot. However, after a four-minute test, he finds that four years have passed on T'Kani Prime, due to the effects of time dilation from having traveled at relativistic speeds. The test was a failure as the fuel was unstable and the ship failed to achieve hyperspace speeds. Buzz vows to continue testing the fuel mix until they perfect it to continue the mission.
Buzz is introduced to Sox (Peter Sohn), a robotic feline who has been assigned to give him company after his long duration away from the colony, and continues testing the hyperspace fuel. To keep Sox busy, Buzz asks him to work on the fuel stability problem. With every test, four more years pass on T'Kani Prime, until eventually over 62 years have passed. During this time, the colony develops; Alisha raises a son with her wife Kiko, their son grows up, gets a promotion and gets married. Alisha subsequently dies of old age; and Sox improves the fuel's composition, allowing it to obtain faster-than-light speeds.Against the orders of his new commanding officer, Cal Burnside (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) (Cal informs Buzz that the colony has decided to build a laser shield to keep the critters out and that the current planet will be humanity's new home.. so, there is no need for hyperspace fuel anymore), Buzz uses this new fuel composition for a successful hyperspace test. But during the escape from the colony, Buzz breaks the computer with the formula, so the fuel sample in his hand is the only one left.
Upon landing, Buzz discovers 22 years have passed, during which T'Kani Prime has been invaded by Zyclops robots led by the mysterious Zurg (James Brolin). Buzz meets up with members of the colony's defense forces, including Izzy Hawthorne (Keke Palmer), Alisha's now-adult granddaughter; Mo Morrison (Taika Waititi), a fresh, naive recruit; and Darby Steel (Dale Soules), an elderly paroled convict. While initially reluctant to work with them, Buzz eventually warms to them. Together, they plan to attack Zurg's ship and destroy the invading force.Izzy takes Buzz to an abandoned storage area where some of the old ships are kept. Buzz manages to steal a ship, but has to take the others with him when they are attacked by giant critters. On their way to space. the ship is attacked by Zurg, who manages to hit Buzz's ship and forces him to land on the dark side of the planet.
The attack damages the ship's capacitor coil, forcing the group to get one from an abandoned mine a few miles away. The Zurg tracks them down at the mine and attacks the group, but strangely only goes after Buzz. Buzz manages to escape, but the robots launched by Zurg manage to steal the hyperspace fuel sample from Buzz's ship.Following an encounter, Zurg abducts Buzz, bringing him aboard his ship where he reveals that he is an older version of him from an alternate time-line in which, after the successful hyperspace test, Burnside attempted to arrest him for stealing the craft and forced him to escape. Aided by the effects of time dilation, he traveled to the far future, encountering a technologically advanced and abandoned vessel. He assumed Zurg's identity by wearing his signature Mecha suit, and traveled to the now-present to obtain more hyperspace fuel from Buzz in order to travel further back in time and prevent the exploration vessel from landing on T'Kani Prime in the first place. However, Buzz refuses due to the implications of the possible temporal paradox that would result from such actions, which would wipe out the current time-line and everyone from it. Meanwhile, Izzy, Mo, Darby, and Sox board Zurg's ship to assist Buzz. After a chaotic assault on the ship, Buzz and his comrades-in-arms destroy the ship and escape.However, Zurg, having survived his ship's destruction, arrives and attacks Buzz, grabbing the hyperspace fuel. Buzz shoots the fuel, causing it to explode and incapacitate Zurg. With the fuel gone, Buzz wishes to stay on T'Kani Prime. Upon landing, Burnside arrests Buzz, but relents, allowing Buzz to revive the Space Ranger Corps. Buzz selects Izzy, Mo, Darby, and Sox to form the core of this organization, much to Burnside's surprise. Buzz and his team are then sent off to a new adventure in parts unknown. In a post-credits scene, a seemingly lifeless Zurg is floating in space when his eyes suddenly light up.","While spending years attempting to return home, marooned Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear encounters an army of ruthless robots commanded by Zurg who are attempting to steal his fuel source."

There are visible bruises and wounds on her hips and upper inner thighs-injuries sustained from forced sexual assault. The woman is told that this is the work of ghosts or her wild imagination. This is trend of this colony and this went on for several years.In 2010, the women and girls of an unnamed, isolated Mennonite colony discover that the men have been using livestock tranquilizer to subdue and sexually assault them. The attackers are arrested and imprisoned in a nearby city for their own protective as the women of the colony brutally attacked them.
Most of the men of the colony travel to oversee the bail, leaving the women by themselves for two days to determine how they will proceed. The women were told to forgive the men, or to leave the colony.
They hold a plebiscite to decide whether to stay and do nothing, stay and fight, or leave.The vote is tied between staying and fighting and leaving. Eleven of the colony's women band together at a hayloft to come to a final decision, though Scarface Janz (Frances McDormand), a ""do-nothing"" woman, leaves the meeting after becoming disillusioned with the discussion, taking her hesitant daughter Anna (Kira Guloien) and resistant granddaughter Helena (Shayla Brown) with her. The women have 24 hours to decide. Janz says that if the women do not forgive, they will be excommunicated and they will lose their place in heaven.
August (Ben Whishaw), the colony's schoolteacher and one of two remaining men, joins the women to record the meeting, as none of the women were taught to read or write. The second man is Melvin (August Winter), a transgender man who, after being assaulted, does not speak, except to the young children. Therefore, he is left in charge of watching over them and warning the women of any outside developments.
Melvin was previously a woman named Neitje (Liv McNeil) was assaulted by her own brother. Neitje had a miscarriage during her pregnancy.Salome (Claire Foy), just back from a trip to gather antibiotics for her little daughter who was assaulted, remains adamant about staying and fighting, an opinion shared by Mejal (Michelle McLeod). Salome had to walk a day and a half with her daughter on her back, to the nearest mobile clinic to get the antibiotics.
Ona (Rooney Mara), who is pregnant after being raped, also suggests that they stay and, after winning the fight, create a new set of rules for the colony that would give the women equality. Women would be taught in schools and allowed to explore the outside world. Mariche (Jessie Buckley), Greta's (Sheila McCarthy) daughter and Autje's (Kate Hallett) mother, disagrees, believing that forgiveness is the only viable option.
Ona says that the men of the colony created the circumstances under which the exploitation of women continue for so long. Ona also suggests that the men could be asked to leave, and the women share a collectively laugh at the idea. The men have the power, and they know it.To defuse the conflict, Ona suggests that August create one document stating the pros and cons of leaving, and another document doing the same for staying.
Pro to staying is that the women won't have to find a new home. They would not have to leave their loved ones behind.
Con of staying & fighting is that they will not be forgiven.The meeting is adjourned. During the break, it is revealed that August is from an excommunicated family (as her mother questioned the practices of the family, and encouraged other people to question them as well) but was recently granted permission to return so that he could be a teacher to the boys of the colony. He and Ona were good childhood friends, and he has had romantic feelings for her since.When the women are counted for the 2010 census, they learn that Klaas (Eli Ham), Mariche's abusive husband, will return that evening to collect more bail money. The meeting resumes. Ona and Mejal change their minds in favor of leaving.
Pros of leaving: they will be safe, and they will see the world. There are no cons of leaving, but they would have to leave their brothers and sons behind.
One argument is to allow men to follow the women, but that would mean that all men would come as they cannot survive without the women.
Ona says that they will need livestock to live along the way. And a map to guide themselves, which August agrees to provide.Salome remains insistent upon fighting, angrily confessing that she would rather kill the men than put her daughter in further harm's way. However, she changes her opinion after being reminded by Agata (Judith Ivey), her mother as well as Ona's, of the principles of their faith.
Greta says that leaving will give them the long term perspective to allow them to forgive the men.
The only remaining unconvinced member is Mariche. An argument ensues between her and the rest of the women; it is revealed that she forgave her husband's abuse at Greta's urging. After Greta apologizes, Mariche agrees to leave.Their reasons for leaving are transcribed by August: to ensure the safety of their children, to be steadfast in their faith, and to have freedom of thought. They decide to try to take boys aged fifteen years and younger with them but will not force any boy over age twelve.
Salome disagrees as her boy is over 12 years old. August says that boys of 13 or 14 years of age are capable of inflicting great damage to girls and women. But he also adds that the boys are driven by their hormones and can be taught to behave. He argues that the boys be allowed to accompany the women, if they choose to leave.They prepare to leave at sunrise, concealing their plans from Klaas. August teaches Ona how to read a map and how to navigate by looking at the stars.
Mariche has to return home to Klaas. Klaas gets very drunk and starts hitting his daughter when he finds that she has taken the horses in preparation for their departure the next day. Mariche reveals their plans to Klaas and ends up with a broken arm and a severely bruise face.
August, at Ona's behest, posts the documents stating the pros and cons of leaving and staying on the walls as an ""artifact"" of the women's time in the colony. He also declares his love to Ona and gives her a map for the women to use.Before they can leave, Melvin tells Salome that her teenage son Aaron (Nathaniel McParland) has fled and hidden. He is found but cannot be convinced to leave in enough time. Salome, breaking the rules of their departure, tranquilizes Aaron, forcing him to leave with them. She reveals this only to August, who understands and does not question her. He asks her to look after Ona and reveals his intent to kill himself once the women are gone. She instead asks him to teach the boys properly to prevent any further violence and to give him purpose. Helena and Anna join the rest of the women, while Scarface and August watch on as they depart.","Do nothing, stay and fight, or leave. In 2010, the women of an isolated religious community grapple with reconciling a brutal reality with their faith."

Ani prepares to marry her boyfriend, Luke Harrison (Finn Wittrock). Luke is educated, good looking, athletic and comes from money. Ani pretends to be all perfect in front of Luke, but she is a wild person on the inside. She loves pizza and eating with her hands. She hides this side of her from Luke. Nell (Justine Lupe) is Ani's friend. Ani has recurring memories of an incident that happened before in life. She is afraid of claustrophobia, knives and drunk guys.At her magazine, Ani is made to write trashy pieces to keep the lights on, while other writers get the topics with gravitas. Her boss Lolo (Jennifer Beals) has promised her to take her to New York Times as senior editor, when she switches jobs.
Ani meets with Aaron Wickersham (Dalmar Abuzeid), a documentary director who wants to make a short film about the school shooting she survived as a teenager. He informs her that a former classmate, Dean Barton (Alex Barone), who went on to become a successful writer (and is releasing a new book shortly and knows that the documentary will help promote his new book) and advocate for gun control, has agreed to take part. Ani declines to be involved. She was the survivor of the deadliest private school shooting incident in history. Dean says that Ani was part of the shooting, but Ani has refused to answer questions or provide clarifications of any kind. Aaron promises that his work will not cause any further harm to Ani or her reputation, but she still refuses.Luke informs Ani that his firm has offered him an opportunity to move to London and suggests Ani can take an MFA program there to allow her to write for herself. She agrees, despite having hopes of someday working at The New York Times. Ani goes for her wedding dress fitting and is angry that her mother Dina finds faults in her near perfect dress. Nell wants Ani to go on the documentary with Aaron and expose Dean and his bucket of lies. Ani says she needs to be bullet proof if she decides to take Dean on. This is why she needs the NYT gig, credibility.
Later that week, Ani's boss tells her that they both have a job at the New York Times.
They later have dinner with a couple Luke knows; the husband turns out to be Ani's former teacher, Andrew Larson (Scoot McNairy). Andrew says he is doing the documentary with Aaron.On the way back, Ani tells Luke that she has the job at NYT. Luke tells Ani not to take on Dean as Dean is respected, while Ani is not. Ani is angry at this suggestion of modeling her career to measure up to someone else's standards.In flashbacks to 1999, Ani (Chiara Aurelia) is seen joining the prestigious Brentley School (on a writing scholarship) (Ani was the only one who wasn't filthy rich or came from pedigree), where she quickly befriends a clique of popular students, including Dean (Carson MacCormac) and his friends Liam (Isaac Kragten) and Peyton (Gage Munroe). Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Ani was sexually assaulted at a party (at Liam's house, after the girls went there from a school dance) by all three boys while intoxicated. She shared what happened with Mr. Larson, who encouraged her to tell her eccentric mother, Dina (Connie Britton), but Ani refused. Mr Larson took Ani to the school principal, but Ani could not definitely say if she told Dean that she didn't want to have sex with him. But she knows that she was sexually assaulted. Mr Larson is fired for letting the girls leave the school dance.
However, she told her friend Arthur (Thomas Barbusca), who had been continuously bullied by the three boys. Arthur encourages Ani to confront Dean, so this bullying can stop. Arthur confronts Dean in the school and Dean starts punching him, when Arthur retaliates, his punch lands on a teacher. Arthur is livid that Ani apologized to Liam, the one who assaulted her.Ani's past slowly starts to haunt her, which begins to affect her relationship with Luke. Ani is really bothered about Dean coming back into her life and the memories of the past start to haunt her all over again. She can't even have sex with Luke without triggering the memories of her sexual assault.
Aaron tells Ani that Dean wants to meet with her to apologize on camera; she agrees, under the condition that Aaron keeps them separate until she is ready. Meanwhile, Ani struggles with her strained relationship with Dina, who claims she always found Ani difficult and alludes that she is only marrying Luke for his money.At the documentary filming, Dean shows up unexpectedly early and Ani flees in a panic. Flashbacks see young Ani struggling to deal with the trauma of what happened to her, and not long after, the school shooting took place, perpetrated by Arthur and his friend Ben. Peyton and Liam were killed, and Dean was wounded severely and left unable to walk. Ani kills Arthur with a knife after he & Ben had shot their tormentors. Ben shot himself.
Prior to the funerals, Dean started a rumor that Ani slept with him and helped Arthur and Ben plan the shooting because Dean didn't want to be her boyfriend anymore. Ani is consequently shunned by everyone, including Dina, who blamed her for causing her own sexual assault by drinking and partying too much.Ani wants nothing to do with Dean. She writes an article and shows to Lolo. Lolo tells Ani to decide what she wants in life and not worry about what everybody else wants from her. She wants Ani to rewrite the article as if nobody else will ever read it, not Luke, not her mother, not her in-laws and so on.
Back in 2015, at the publishing of his new book, Ani meets with Dean, who shows little remorse for what he did and threatens to recapitulate his story of her participation in the shooting if she tells anyone. But after being confronted by Ani during the conversation, Dean admits he sexually assaulted her. Having secretly recorded their conversation, Ani leaves. She decides to share her experience after encouragement from her boss and ends up writing a piece for The New York Times.At their rehearsal dinner, Ani receives the final article that she submitted to Lolo, which is about to be published, much to Luke's dismay, who says he wishes she had dealt with it privately. Ani then confesses she has been using him to hide from her past and decides not to marry him. Ani finally begins to move on; she receives an overwhelming reaction from other women who tell her their stories of sexual assault, as she begins her career at The New York Times.","A woman in New York, who seems to have things under control, is faced with a trauma that makes her life unravel."

Clarke double-crosses and kills him just as the authorities raid the mansion. Amid the chaos, Colombian DNI agent Luis Rojas (Édgar Ramírez) obtains the device. Luis contacts multiple spy agencies to sell the device for $ 3MM in cash, in Paris.
CIA operative Mason ""Mace"" Brown (Jessica Chastain) is assigned to purchase the drive from Rojas. She heads to Paris with longtime partner Nick Fowler (Sebastian Stan), with whom she is also in a relationship. The deal goes south when German undercover BND agent Marie Schmidt (Diane Kruger) swipes the bag holding the money. Mace chases Marie, who escapes via the subway while Nick is confronted in an alley by Clarke.At CIA headquarters, Mace learns that Nick was found dead in the alley. Her superior, Larry Marks (John Douglas Thompson), gives her his blessing to retrieve the drive by any means (he cant help her officially, but tells her to complete the mission on her own). Mace travels to London to recruit a longtime friend, retired British MI6 operative Khadijah Adiyeme (Lupita Nyong'o). Khadijah is an expert on cyber security and understands the true magnitude of the threat from the device. She agrees to come out of retirement, when she learns that Nick has been shot dead. Khadijah helps Mace track down both Marie and Luis.
Rojas arranges to hand the drive over to Graciela Rivera (Penélope Cruz), a DNI psychologist with no field experience. Graciela was assigned to get Luis to relinquish the drive into her possession and turn himself in for processing by their agency.
Marie is pushed to go after the drive by her boss, Jonas Muller (Sylvester Groth), who brings up how Marie's father was a senior BND agent whom she personally turned after discovering that he was a Russian mole.Mace and Khadijah track Luis and Graciela to a market only for the DNI agent overseeing the hand-off to turn on Luis and Garciela and kill Luis. before dying, Luis gives Graciela a phone only she can open that tracks the drive. Both Mace and Marie chase the thief (The DNI agent, who now has the drive), who escapes.
Marie takes Graciela to a safe house with Mace and Khadijah arriving shortly thereafter. Khadijah points out they all want the drive and are better off working together. The four track the thief to Morocco (using Luis's phone), apprehending him and taking out rival mercenaries before handing the drive over to Marks.
While celebrating over drinks, news breaks of planes crashing, and cities hit by massive power outages-indicating the drive is in terrorists' hands. They return to the safe house to find Marks dead. After escaping from a CIA assault squad, the women realize they have been framed for Marks' death and the theft of the device.Under interrogation, the thief reveals that the recent incidents are all part of a ""demonstration"" for prospective buyers at an illegal black-market auction in Shanghai. The group infiltrates the auction where Mace is shocked to discover that not only is Nick alive (Nick tries to explain how he escaped and is only trying to secure his living post the CIA), but is secretly Clarke's mole in the CIA. The group fails to prevent him from obtaining the device, but a mysterious Chinese woman (who was posing as the director of the auction house and authenticated the drive before handing it over to Nick) helps them escape the auction.
She identifies herself as Lin Mi Sheng (Fan Bingbing), and explains that the drive was used as bait to allow her agency to identify the criminals in attendance. She also tells Mace that Marks had been on Clarke's payroll (Marks knocked out the power and crashed the planes, before Lin Mi and her team reached there and killed him), and that she took the device from Nick (And substituted it for a decoy) during their escape.Nick is beaten by Clarke's men for bringing a decoy device. He then captures the group, revealing that Clarke has Muller, Khadijah's boyfriend Ahmed (Raphael Acloque), and Graciela's family as hostages. Nick executes Lin's elderly father in front of the group, while Muller and Ahmed are executed on camera. Lin agrees to travel with Clarke and hand over the drive personally to spare Graciela's family. The other women overcome their grief to realize Lin is transmitting her location through a camera in her glasses. Arming themselves, they rescue Lin, shoot Nick, and destroy the drive before getting arrested.Two months later, Nick, now promoted to a senior rank in the CIA for killing Clarke, returns home to find Mace and the group waiting for him after escaping from custody. Nick passes out from a drug in his drink, and is told he will pay for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in a foreign prison.

While snorkeling off the coast, their tour boat leaves them behind, and they are rescued by a young Balinese seaweed farmer named Gede. Lily and Gede hit it off. 37 days later, Lily emails David and Georgia to let them know that she and Gede are getting married, and she is staying in Bali permanently, giving up her legal career before it begins. David and Georgia form a truce to try and convince Lily that she is rushing into things and making the same mistake that they had made. Their pilot on the flight to Bali turns out to be Paul, Georgia's boyfriend, who arranged to fly this flight and return to visit Georgia in Bali a few days later, as a surprise.David and Georgia give their verbal blessing to Lily and Gede, but secretly plan a ""Trojan horse"" strategy to sabotage the wedding from within. Their scheme includes stealing the couple's wedding rings, which the couple quickly replaces. Gede immediately suspects David and Georgia, but hides his suspicions from Lily. While carrying out this plan, David and Georgia begin to mend fences with one another. They also get to know Gede and his large extended family and come to see that he really does care for Lily. Paul shows up and surprises Georgia with a series of marriage proposals, the first of which is interrupted by a snake bite at the temple of Tanah Lot, and the second proposal is prevented by an accidental head-butt.When Lily discovers the stolen rings, she demands that they get on board with the wedding or go home. She also confronts Gede, who had simultaneously confessed his harbored suspicions toward David and Georgia stealing the rings. David and Georgia realize that they will lose Lily forever if they do not support her decision, and they decide to offer their support. The wedding proceeds in accordance with Balinese custom. As the couple prepares to ceremonially stab a dagger through a pandan-leaf mat to complete the bond of marriage, Gede pauses the wedding ceremony to ask David and Georgia to give their blessing sincerely this time, offering not to go through with it unless they agree. David stands up and says that the couple has their blessing, but that they do not really need it, and if he and Georgia had listened to all of their own detractors (David's friends and Georgia's parents, respectively), they never would have had Lily. And however their marriage turned out, they are both happier in a world with Lily in it. Lily and Gede are touched, and they complete the ceremony and get married.On the morning of the wedding, Georgia tells Paul that she cannot marry him, and they end their relationship. David and Georgia toy with romance again, even kissing each other once, before pulling away and laughing about it. David, Georgia, and Wren exchange tearful goodbyes with Lily and board a boat to leave. David and Georgia consider their romantic prospects again, debating aloud whether they are too old to feel young again, and when they might return to Bali. In a flash, they both decide to stay, jumping off the boat to return to the dock and decide to reconcile their feelings and stay in Bali full time to be close to Lily and Gede.",A divorced couple teams up and travels to Bali to stop their daughter from making the same mistake they think they made 25 years ago.

Carlo was only ten years old and Gepetto loved him dearly and he was his only companion. together they worked on carving a crucifix for the local church. The whole town loved the father son duo. Geppetto honors his memory by planting a pine-cone (one that Carlo had selected before he died) near his grave and spends the next twenty years mourning his loss.An anthropomorphic cricket named Sebastian J. Cricket (Ewan McGregor) takes up residence in the resulting pine tree. Geppetto subsequently cuts the tree down in a fit of drunken rage in order to make a new son out of its wood. He passes out drunk, leaving the puppet unfinished, and a blue Wood Sprite (Tilda Swinton) (Her appearance is a humanoid with two wings that have eyes on them and a snake-like tail) brings it to life, christening him Pinocchio (Gregory Mann). The Sprite meets Sebastian and promises to grant him a wish, which he intends to use to become famous, in exchange for acting as Pinocchio's guide.Geppetto later discovers that Pinocchio is alive (and wreaks havoc inside Gepetto's cabin as he discovers the new world in front of him) and locks him in a closet while he goes to church, but he follows him, frightening the villagers. The town Podesta visits Geppetto along with the priest (Burn Gorman) to determine if Pinocchio poses a threat to the village. He finds that Pinocchio is harmless but is undisciplined. He orders Geppetto to send the boy to school. The next day, Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school, but the puppet is intercepted by a man and his performing monkey, aristocrat-turned-showman Count Volpe (Christoph Waltz) and Spazzatura (Cate Blanchett), respectively. Count Volpe's circus is in financial trouble, and he sees Pinocchio as a way to draw in large crowds and regain his lost glory.Count Volpe convinces Pinocchio to join his circus and gets him to sign a contract. Geppetto comes looking for him, and Sebastian guides him to the circus, where Volpe had taken him. After Geppetto arrives to take him home, he and Volpe have a tug-of-war that results in Pinocchio being thrown to the road, where he is hit by a car.
Pinocchio is sent to the afterlife where he meets the Black Rabbits (Tim Blake Nelson). He is then sent through the doors to meet Death (Tilda Swinton) (Her appearance is a Chimera with the face of a human, the horns of a cape buffalo, the lower horns of a Jacob sheep, the body of a lion, the wings of a bird with eyes on them, and a snake-headed tail), the sister of the Wood Sprite. She explains to Pinocchio that he is immortal, and that he will return to the mortal realm once an hourglass has emptied, cautioning that the time he spends in the afterlife will increase each time he returns.Returning to the mortal realm, Pinocchio decides to join Volpe's circus (else Gippetto has to pay Volpe 10 million Lire as per the terms of the contract), both to earn money for Geppetto and to avoid being drafted into the Royal Italian Army by the strict village Podesta (Ron Perlman). Podesta thinks that Pinocchio is the perfect soldier as he cannot be killed.
By the time Geppetto finds out, Volpe had already left town with his circus and vanished.When Sebastian and Geppetto search for Pinocchio at sea, they are swallowed by a giant sea monster. Meanwhile Pinocchio learns that Volpe has been using him and not sending any money back to his father as agreed. Volpe had been using Pinocchio non-stop for performances and was scheduled to perform for Mussolini next. During one of his performances, Pinocchio sings a disparaging parody of a patriotic song to Benito Mussolini (Tom Kenny) as revenge for Volpe's abuse and is summarily executed.Once revived, Pinocchio finds himself taken by the Podesta to a training camp where other small boys are trained to fight in the war. Pinocchio befriends the Podesta's son, Candlewick (Finn Wolfhard), who is scared of disappointing his father and being seen as weak. Per Pinocchio's advice, Candlewick stands up to his father, but the training camp gets bombed by enemy aircraft, killing the Podesta. The blast of the bomb causes Pinocchio to be thrown into the air.
Pinocchio manages to escape and is captured by Volpe, who tries to burn him in revenge (his circus was burnt down by Mussolini to avenge his insult at the hands of Pinocchio) but is stopped by Spazzatura. They are sent over a cliff and Volpe falls to his death, while Pinocchio rescues Spazzatura. Soon after, they are swallowed by the sea monster and reunite with Geppetto and Sebastian in its stomach.Pinocchio lies to make his nose grow, thus forming a bridge leading out of the monster's blowhole. Just as they escape, the monster attempts to eat them again, causing Pinocchio to sacrifice himself by detonating a naval mine that the monster is in the process of swallowing. Upon meeting Death again, Pinocchio demands to be sent back early so that he can save Gepetto from drowning (who was knocked unconscious by the blast), despite the fact that this will make him mortal. After rescuing Geppetto, Pinocchio dies, prompting Sebastian to use his wish to bring Pinocchio back to life, which the Wood Sprite grants.Pinocchio and the others return home to live as a family. However, Pinocchio outlives all of his loved ones. Ultimately alone, Pinocchio decides to travel to parts unknown for new adventures.
During the credits, Sebastian sings for the Black Rabbits in the afterlife.","A puppet is brought to life by a fairy, who assigns him to lead a virtuous life in order to become a real boy."

The test subjects, technically prisoners of the state, are volunteers for the project aiming to reduce their sentence time. The program is overseen by the sympathetic and hospitable Steve Abnesti, along with his assistant Mark. The prisoners have their own rooms, do chores, and are free to roam without guard supervision. The subjects go through daily test runs of various drugs, all of which alter their emotions and their perceptions of their surroundings.Inmate Jeff, still reeling from having killed his friend whilst drunk driving, is given N-40, a ""love drug"", which distorts his senses and drives him to have sex with two of his fellow inmates. Steve asks him to choose which one of them to give Darkenfloxx, a drug that induces intense fear and psychological pain. He declines to choose, claiming he feels nothing in particular for either one of them after the effects of the love drug had worn off. Mark helps Steve administer some N-40 to himself.The next day, Steve brings Jeff into the observation room and tells him that the ""higher ups"" have decided that the younger of the two women, Heather, must be injected with a dose, though it will only last 5 minutes. Jeff reluctantly agrees, and to his horror, Heather commits suicide while on the Darkenfloxx after she damages her MobiPak, the device that administers the drugs. This causes Mark to doubt their work in the facility. As Steve rushes out of the projection room, he drops his keys. Jeff unlocks Steve's desk compartment, discovering that there are no ""higher-ups"": the prison is run by Abnesti Pharmaceuticals, Steve's company. The drugs were named from a bingo card.Steve and Jeff get high together on a laughing drug, as Steve also has a MobiPak installed. Steve tells Jeff that his father abandoned him as a child. Jeff confesses to Lizzy, an inmate he is close with, that he not only killed his friend in the car accident but his girlfriend as well. Lizzy hugs him and they kiss. Steve notices Jeff's feelings for Lizzy. Mark becomes doubtful of Steve's motives, and he breaks down when Jeff confronts him.When Steve asks Jeff to administer Darkenfloxx to Lizzy, Jeff takes control of Steve's MobiPak, reveals that Mark has spiked his Mobipak with Darkenfloxx, and forces him to admit the true goal of the program: testing a compliance drug, B-6. The other drugs are merely side projects being used to put B-6 to the ultimate test: whether or not they would harm their love when commanded to. The entire time inmates had been consenting to the various tests, they had really been under the influence of the obedience drug. In addition, Steve informs Jeff that he had in fact finished his sentence seven months previously, while Lizzy's appeal for release had passed the previous week. Jeff forces Steve to open the door of the main entrance to free Lizzy and then tries to order him to hand over the pocket knife. Steve resists the order (as complying would be killing the project, ""the only thing he has ever loved""), and instead takes his phone and enables all four vials of Darkenfloxx in Lizzy's MobiPak, causing her to behave hysterically and attempt suicide. The two fight for control and Jeff is able to disarm Steve, damaging his MobiPak in the process. Jeff rushes to save Lizzy, successfully removes the vials of Darkenfloxx and tells her he loves her, but Steve gets up and orders the other inmates to apprehend Jeff and Lizzy. They are able to escape from Spiderhead after overpowering some of the other inmates and locking the main door behind them. Mark and the police are now approaching the island as Steve escapes on his float-plane, but he joyously crashes into a mountain as he is now high off of his damaged MobiPak. Meanwhile, Jeff and Lizzy take the remaining motorboat and escape.In a voice-over, Jeff comments that no drug can bestow self-forgiveness, instead it must be worked on and chosen.

Ensign Jesse Brown (Jonathan Majors) walks out and asks if he's the transfer.Hudner meets the other guys in the Fighter Squadron 32: Carol Mohring (Nick Hargrove), Bo Lavery (Spencer Neville), Marty Goode (Joe Jonas), and Bill Koenig (Darren Kagasoff), led by Lieutenant Commander Dick Cevoli (Thomas Sadoski) who shows them intel that Stalin and the Soviets tested their own bomb and it won't be long until they strap it to a bomber. Cevoli assigns Hudner with Brown.In the air, Brown flies without thinking about risks. He's always in control, just not by the book. They take a detour on the way home. Hudner follows him because a wing-man never leaves his partner. The flying isn't what Hudner is used to. Brown even nose dives in a residential neighborhood and if you look closely, a nice lady, Daisy Brown (Christina Jackson), stands in her front yard waving at them as they pull up at the last minute.Back in the locker room, Hudner asks Brown what was up with that. Brown replies ""the only way to find out about your wing-man is at 2,000 feet."" Hudner asks if he wants to grab a beer to get to know him, but Brown declines. He does not drink.Cevoli has the squad over to his house for clams. Hudner tells Lavery he signed up with the Navy right after hearing about Pearl Harbor. He graduated one month after the war ended. Lavery says life doesn't turn out like you plan, ""I mean, did you ever think you'd be in a squadron with a colored aviator?"" Hudner dodges the question and moves to the food.Brown drives home. He waves to a neighbor who is not happy to see him. He tiptoes inside and scares his wife, Daisy, as she's painting the hallway walls. They have a fun, loving relationship and a three-year-old daughter, Pam.Cevoli briefs the team. A recon plane washed ashore with bullet holes underneath. The team will now prepare to be ready for the Russians in a new type of plane, aka widow maker. The engine is one of the most powerful things these pilots will fly behind. Throttle too much, and she'll spin you over. There's enough torque to flip a house. The pilots must go easy.On the way home, Hudner sees Brown on the side of the road with car trouble. He offers him a ride home. Hudner tells him he was called to adventure and didn't want to take over his father's grocery stores. Brown always wanted to fly, and with the best pilots, so he joined the Navy. At the Brown residence, Daisy offers Hudner a drink but Brown declines because Hudner must have plans. Hudner takes the hint and graciously declines the offer. Daisy tells Brown to play nice, but Brown doesn't know about Hudner yet.The pilots check out the widow makers in person. They all run drills and get used to flying the new type of plane. They get the news they are shipping out. Daisy boosts Brown's confidence before he leaves home.The next day, Brown hides in the bathroom stall. Until everyone else in the locker room has left, he stares at himself in the mirror. And says numerous degrading comments to himself.Hudner's in his plane. Everyone on the team is watching as he makes his landing. He does it without trouble. Next, it's Brown's turn. All of the Black crew members on the carrier come up to see. Brown is flying too high. Hudner says he needs to get his nose up. The flag man guides him up, and Brown misses the carrier. He comes back around and feels the pressure. He is able to land the plane. Everyone has passed their carrier quals, and Hudner passed with perfect scores.They are shipping out tomorrow, and Cevoli tells them to get their affairs in order. Hudner gives Brown a lift home, and Brown invites him inside this time. Daisy offers Hudner a drink and asks him to be there for Brown.Brown enjoys his evening with his family at the beach.The next day on the carrier, the team runs down the hallways, up the stairs, and to their planes. But it's just a drill, and Cevoli says they have to do better. The team returns to their quarters, but Brown is asked to interview with Life Magazine for a positive story to ease the public's anxiety about another potential war. Brown wants to be treated like any other pilot, while the interviewer wants the colored angle. Cevoli comes to his rescue and pulls Brown back to work.Below deck, one of the army guys asks if Brown juggles too. Hudner goes nose-to-nose with the guy, but Brown makes the pilots talk away. Brown and Hudner will talk later. Hudner wanted to teach that guy a lesson, while Brown says it's better this way.Cevoli needs a volunteer for a task that no one wants to do. Hudner volunteers like Brown nudges Mohring to do it, and Hudner lets him. Mohring completes the tasks in the plane but can't make the landing. The plane crashes into the ocean. Everyone is troubled by Mohring's death, but Brown lets Hudner know he doesn't appreciate him making comments about what Mohring should have/could have done. Hudner insists the pilots won't die if they do what they're told. Later, the pilots give a toast to Mohring. Once it's just Brown and Hudner, Brown tells Hudner at the academy. They made him do his tests ten times because they didn't believe a Black man could swim. Stuck rocks in his flight suit, held him under and put ice in the water. They didn't care if he died in that pool, but every time Brown made it out. He would be dead if he did what people told him to do. That's what he was trying to teach Mohring.They dock in Caan. The pilots go ashore and sight-see. Brown runs into a store for Daisy's gift and sees a crowd of sailors. He goes to see what's up, and it's actress Elizabeth Taylor. One of the sailors makes a derogatory comment about not being with Brown. Elizabeth Taylor invites Brown to a casino party later that night. The pilots show up but are denied access to the french casino. But Brown starts speaking French, and they reluctantly let them in.After dancing and drinking, they thank Elizabeth and head to another spot. Hudner spots a beautiful woman and flirts with her by doing a magic trick. The army guys from the carrier show up, and a fight starts because the guy thinks he had a shot with Elizabeth back at the casino, and Brown messed that up for him.Cevoli briefs the team. The North Koreans have taken Seoul. If they take the rest of the southern peninsula, they could take Japan, and then America can't contain Communism.The ship sets sail for Korea. There may be one hundred thousand Chinese already in North Korea. The mission is to take out two bridges over a major river along the border, hoping to slow the Chinese from sending in more troops.This time Cevoli flies with the team. But Hudner confirms that Cevoli's plane has a mechanical issue with his landing gear and passes the command to Hudner. They fly over and are met with enemy fire. They cannot completely destroy the bridges, but Brown disobeys orders and returns to finish the job.In Korea, the army guys are now on the ground, freezing their behinds off and waiting for the Chinese to attack. They do, and it's an uneven fight.Hudner hands in his mission report to Cevoli. He stated exactly what happened. Brown confronts him about it and says discipline for Brown is different than discipline for anyone else. Hudner understands and asks the team to write their accounts to clear Brown. Hudner walks in on Brown, repeating to himself in the mirror every hateful word anyone has ever said to him. Hudner tells him that he got the other guys to give testimony that the mission was complicated and Brown did the right thing. But Brown knows a piece of paper won't help him. Hudner asks him what he wants him to do and Brown replies, ""just be my wing-man. Forget the lifesaver and get in the damn water.""On deck, Brown gets some fresh air. He's joined by a Black crew member. He tells Brown that they all heard he had some good flying the other day and wanted to let Brown know they saw him. They all pitched in and bought him a watch in Caan. Engraved on the back is ""Above All Others."" Brown is touched by this gesture.On the runway, Brown runs into a friend from the past who he calls Alabama. Alabama is with the search and rescue unit.Daisy receives a letter from Brown. He hid her birthday gift and gave clues for her to find it. She finds the gift, earrings, in Pam's closet. He closes his letter with ""lovingly and completely yours. I'll love you forever.""Cevoli and the team are briefed. The army is fighting in an unspeakable hell. For every marine, there are six Chinese hiding in the woods. Gets below minus thirty at night. The boys are holding on by their fingernails, and air support would greatly help, but it is a dangerous mission.On the ground, the marines pray and finally advance their vantage point when the pilots arrive. They give them hell, but once they leave the area, Hudner notices Brown's plane is leaking fuel. Brown states that it's oil. He needs to take the plane down easily because he won't last much longer. Cevoli calls in search and rescue. Brown releases all of his missiles so they won't end up in the enemy's hands. Brown lands hard. Hudner can't see him moving. He decides to crash land his plane to be with Brown. The other pilots try to talk him out of it, but he takes his plane down after releasing his missiles.He runs to Brown, who is wedged between his seat and the control panel. Both men try to lift it off him, but they can't.Search and rescue gets Cevoli's mayday call, but it's too dark to land. Alabama overhears and tells them he's on his way.In the freezing cold, Hudner gives Brown his beanie cap to keep him warm. Hudner tries to extinguish the fire on Brown's engine with snow. Brown is still stuck when Alabama arrives. They try to get him free, but he's still wedged. Brown becomes weaker and weaker and asks Hudner to tell Daisy he'll always love her. Hudner starts beating the plane with all his might to free Brown but stops once he realizes that Brown has passed away.They leave, and Hudner promises to come back for Brown. Hudner begs his commanders to let him go back for Brown's body, but they deny him. Brown's body was never recovered.Back on the carrier, Hudner is checked out by the doctor. Cevoli leads the other pilots on a funeral flight to say goodbye to Brown.Daisy receives a letter from the war department. She is overcome with emotion. Time passes, and Daisy flies to Washington, where President Truman gives the Medal of Honor to Jesse Brown and Tom Hudner. After the ceremony, Hudner speaks to Daisy about being afraid of this day. Daisy tells him she appreciates what he did. Hudner says Brown's last words were for her, ""just tell Daisy I love her."" Hudner apologizes for not saving him. Daisy says that wasn't his job. She wanted him to be there for him, and he was.The Hudner and Brown families remained friends for the rest of their lives, and their descendants remained close. The film closes with Brown reading his last letters to Daisy with his signature sign off ""Your devoted husband, lovingly and completely yours. Jesse.""",A pair of U.S. Navy fighter pilots risk their lives during the Korean War and become some of the Navy's most celebrated wingmen.

Tricia brings Esther home and immediately starts to have doubts when she notices that Esther has forgotten about the death of her grandmother or that her painting skills have increased enormously compared to before she disappeared. Leena falls in love with Allen after they both start bonding over their painting skills, and tries to separate him from Tricia.While Tricia and Allen attend a charity gala hosted by Tricia, Donnan arrives at the house and steals a vinyl record from Esther's room which has Leena's fingerprints on it. He takes it back to his house, unaware that Leena has followed him, and analyzes the fingerprints to find it is not a match. Leena attacks Donnan and stabs him with a knife repeatedly, before Tricia arrives, having followed Leena. Instead of stopping Leena, Tricia opens fire on Donnan with a gun and kills him. Tricia reveals that she knows Leena is not Esther, who died four years earlier during an altercation with her older brother Gunnar, which Tricia covered up without Allen's knowledge. Tricia explains that she is only welcoming Leena to make Allen happy again, as he was devastated by Esther's disappearance. Leena reveals her true identity to Tricia, and the two then dispose of Donnan's body in a cellar hatch where the real Esther is buried and frame his disappearance as a vacation trip by forging an email to the police station.Knowing that it would be too suspicious if ""Esther"" were to disappear again, Tricia and Gunnar agree to continue Leena's act for Allen's sake, and Leena and Tricia remain on guard with each other. Eventually, not trusting Leena, Tricia attempts to poison her during dinner, but Leena refuses to eat the food and excuses herself. Leena feeds the food to the rat that lives in her room and later finds the rodent dead from ingesting the poisoned meal. Leena retaliates by making a green smoothie mixed with the rodent's carcass for Tricia. Allen reveals he is going into the city to meet about a potential art gallery. At the train station, Leena attempts to kill Tricia and Gunnar by pushing them in front of a train, but her attempt is accidentally interrupted by a passing commuter. With Allen away, Leena tries fleeing by stealing Tricia's car, but she is soon found by a police officer.That night, Leena is brought back to the Albright house and Tricia and Gunnar finally decide to kill Leena, deciding that she is too dangerous to be kept in their household. Tricia tries to stage a suicide, but Leena fights back and flees before Gunnar throws her down the stairs. Distracted by a phone call from Allen, who is returning home, Tricia and Gunnar search for Leena when she disappears. Gunnar eventually finds Leena in the art room but Leena shoots Gunnar with a crossbow and then stabs him to death with his fencing sword. An enraged Tricia and Leena fight in the kitchen, inadvertently setting the house alight in the process, and the pair flee to the roof as Allen returns home.Tricia and Leena both slip and end up clinging to the roof, begging Allen to save them, with Leena claiming Tricia attacked her, and Tricia trying to reveal the truth about Leena. Unable to save both of them, Allen chooses to help ""Esther"", causing Tricia to lose her grip and fall to her death. Allen then checks Leena's face, which causes her fake teeth to fall out. Realizing she is not Esther, Leena tries to defend herself by saying she did it for them and also confesses her love for him, only for Allen to call her a monster. Enraged, Leena pushes Allen off the roof to his death. Leena then again dresses herself as Esther and leaves the burning house after cleaning off the blood on her face.Later, ""Esther"" is moved to an orphanage where she waits for a new family to adopt her.

The senior detective Jake Doyle (Martin Lawrence) is just as puzzled as her while looking at the first victim inside a church. A woman is tied to the cross with wings on her back, which makes her look like an angel. Upon asking the priest, he notes that he has never seen that woman before. A few more cases are discovered in the city where random women are killed in an identical manner. It makes them consider this person as a 'copycat killer.'The elaborate and detailed way of killing raises suspicion of him using some communication to carry forward these heinous acts. So, it raises suspicion that a serial killer called 'The Artist' aka Arnaud Lefevre (John Malkovich) is behind it, who is serving jail time for his similar way of abduction and murder of six women in the past, all of whom were sex workers. They were killed and poisoned, preserved, and then decorated in lifelike poses using metal frames, which Arnaud called his masterpieces. Jake shares a history with this killer since he was one of the able detectives who tracked him down in the past. So, he gets worried when Mary takes the initiative to question Arnaud due to his past experiences with this man.Upon meeting him in jail, Mary decides to use her knowledge from her psychology education to break his ego and gain insight into the case. However, he does not budge as easily. Soon after, the police find a few more similar corpses, and upon speaking about the first corpse with Arnaud, he asks whether the wings were clipped. She goes to find it on the body and notices a nail polish of a particular color that is out of production, but the one that Mary used to use when she was a child. They notice random clues attached to each dead body, whereas, on another one, they find an arrow from a compass.Jake then recalls the past he shares with Arnaud in regard to his ex's death. His partner at the time - Zeke, killed herself after her contact with Arnaud, and a compass was the only thing that he could not retrieve from her stuff in their apartment. During this time, Mary learns that Jake was in therapy for a while after this incident, which shook him to the core. Meanwhile, there is a constant conflict between Mary and Arnaud in regard to their staunch beliefs in religion vs. science. He brings up the subject of the afterlife and tries to notice her lack of faith and a strong belief that her major in psychology will help her instead.Upon asking about the needle missing from a compass, Mary deduces it to be a metaphor for disorientation, while he considers it a lost soul struggling to find its way. She then returns home and has dinner with her partner - Dale. That is when a homeless man breaks into their house and escapes before she can get hold of him. The next day, they find another corpse, which now has Zeke's compass next to it. When they place the earlier needle into it, it points towards a painting behind which something is written in Dutch, which translates to 'The Inferno Landscape.' They learn that it is an out-of-print art book.While going through it, Mary recalls the archangel Samael's name mentioned by Arnaud. Jake then takes her to a meeting that tries to explain the phenomena of possession, and she does not like the unscientific claims. Meanwhile, with another victim, Mary deduces that Arnaud is trying to prove himself as a master against the psychiatric institute that admitted him in the past. She speaks to him about this encounter when he opens up about his childhood of living with his mother, who was a sex worker.Arnaud then mentions that the copycat killer is a forger of Renaissance paintings and a shop where his counterfeits are often kept in the showcase. She reaches there with Jake, and while taking away one of the paintings, the homeless person from before attacks her again and ends up killing himself. This man named Salazar was bipolar and is considered to be the guy being communicated with by the artist. Then they trace a woman connected with the earlier painting, who used to work as a prostitute. Upon reaching that place, they understand it is Arnaud's house from his childhood, where he lived with his mother. They also find a corpse of hers.Mary confronts him about it, and he opens up about his mother not wanting to draw religious objects but other drawings like a normal kid. Thus, he considered her immoral and killed her. He then mentions archangel Samael's voice speaking with him while he started his artistic journey. She keeps asking him about the copycat while he asks her to sit for a sculpture of hers in exchange for the copycat's address. While he is engaged in that activity, he makes her recall the difficult past with her father. She notes that she was not abused or harassed.However, Arnaud makes her confess her horrifying memories of when she saw her father burning his own hand into flames, and the memory of that incident still scars her and gives her nightmares. That is why she stopped believing in God and in hell. He then mentions her partner - Dale, who was their father, without her having shared any detail about it. After torturing her, he then gives her the sculpture and the address. However, the police who reach there find nothing suspicious, and then she realizes that Arnaud used it as a decoy. According to his talk, she opens up the head of her sculpture to find an address written on it.Mary and Jake go to this house and find an entire wall filled with Kelly's photos and personal details. Jake leaves to make a phone call to bring other police officers to the scene. Meanwhile, Mary hears Lt. Diaz's voice and goes to save him. He notes that the killer is still in the house. When she goes to find him, she realizes that the killer is, in fact, Jake. Through their conversation, she is made to realize that Jake is possessed by Arnaud, who is making him do all these elaborate murders as some sort of retribution for not cooperating with Arnaud's wishes regarding Zeke in the past. Arnaud learned that he has the power of possession over someone else's body when he was a kid.Soon after, it is claimed later that Jake was suffering from an identity-type psychosis that was triggered by the first incident involving Zeke's death. So, since then, he thought he was 'The Artist'. While everyone gets back to their lives, Mary has a conversation with Dr. Losech while Arnaud has possessed his body. This artist claims her to be his next victim. But by then, she had seen his habit of chewing the back of his pencil. So, she fills his pencils with the same poison he used to kill all the women. As a result, he loses control over his body and dies in no time. In this twisted thriller tale, the artist does not survive getting tricked by someone, and he is considered worthless.

Despite his specialism, he speaks no German and is secretly taking basic lessons to prepare for a speech he is due to give at a conference.
Jack is married to Babette (Greta Gerwig), his fourth wife. Together, they raise a blended family with four children: Heinrich (Sam Nivola) and Steffie (May Nivola), from two of Jack's previous marriages; Denise (Raffey Cassidy), from Babette's previous marriage; and Wilder (Henry and Dean Moore), a child they conceived together. Theirs is a normal life, and Babette worries what life would be when the kids grow up and move away.Denise spies on Babette and finds her secret prescription stash of Dylar, a mysterious drug not in the usual records. Jack experiences a dream about a mysterious man trying to kill him, alluding to an earlier conversation with Babette focused on their mutual fear of death. Jack's colleague, Murray Siskind (Don Cheadle), a professor of American culture, wishes to develop a similarly niche field, ""Elvis studies,"" and convinces Jack to help him to establish his course as the main authority on Elvis on campus. Jack goes to Murray's class and they both engage in a debate on how Elvis and Hitler had remarkably similar childhoods (They both were remarkably close to their mothers, and remained close to them during their old age. Both mesmerized crowds). They briefly become rivals as competition between their courses arises.
Babette is starting to lose her memory. Denise told Steffie that Babette is taking some drugs, that might be contributing to her memory loss. Denise tells Jack that Babette is taking Dylar pills.However, their lives are disrupted when a cataclysmic train accident casts a cloud of chemical waste over the town. Jack is very sure that the cloud poses no threat to the city, and tries to calm his family down, initially. He says that society is set up in a way that the poor and the uneducated pay the highest price for man-made disasters. He reckons he and his family are not ""exposed"". This ""Airborne Toxic Event"" (the event was upgraded from ""feathery plume"" to ""Dark billowing Cloud"" to ""Airborne toxic event"" on the radio in short duration) forces a massive evacuation as a cloud of deadly chemicals (Nyodene D) moves towards the town, which leads to a major traffic jam on the highway. As they are on the highway, there are recommendations on the radio that people should remain indoors, and if have already evacuated, they should find shelter quickly. The progress on the highway is slow due to multiple accidents along the way. The car is soon running out of gas.
Jack drives to a gas station to refill his car, where he is inadvertently exposed to the cloud. soon, the airborne toxic event, becomes a huge cloud of smoke, that brings its own weather and thunder and covers the entire town and surrounding highways.
The family and numerous others are forced into quarantine at a summer camp. Jack's daughter Denise tells him that he got exposed to the cloud at the gas station for 2.5 mins. He goes to report himself to the medical desk, where he is told to continue his life. The exposure is real, but the side effects of the exposure will only be known in the next 15 yrs, as the chemical has a life of 30 yrs.
Murray supplies Jack with a small palm-sized pistol to protect himself against the more dangerous survivalists in the camp. One day, chaos ensues when multiple families desperately try to escape the camp (after a panic is created that the toxic cloud is now headed their way). The Gladneys almost make it out but ultimately end up with their car floating in the river (they follow a Land Rover, who has 4 wheel drive and decides to escape through a forested route, that the Gladneys station wagon cannot handle).
They later arrive in Iron City, where they encounter a man who rants about the lack of media attention on the evacuees and spots Jack, claiming he had seen him before looking at him. After nine days, the family manages to return home. However, since Jack was briefly exposed to the chemical waste, his fear of death becomes exacerbated.Later, everything has returned to normal except for Babette, who has become pale, lethargic and emotionally distant from Jack and the rest of the family (she wears her sweatsuit all the time, stares out of the window and cries all the time).
Soon afterward, Jack begins having hallucinations of a mysterious, balding man following him around. Denise shares her concerns regarding Dylar (and how they are effecting Babette) and Jack confronts Babette (Jack talks to her doctor first, but he denies any knowledge of Dylar or having prescribed it to Babette.. Jack investigates further and asks her university Neuro-chemistry professor for an analysis of the drug.. She tells Jack that the drug is a psycho-pharmaceutical.. but the drug itself is not on the market and it is not known what it does). She admits to having joined (by responding to a newspaper ad) a shadowy clinical trial for a drug (super secret and super experimental drug) to treat death anxieties, and when she was cut from the trial, agreed to having sex with ""Mr. Gray"" in exchange for a continuing supply of the drug. This went on continuously for a few months. The sex was at a grubby motel where the TV was near the ceiling.Intrigued by the idea, Jack asks Denise for the Dylar bottle, but she reveals she threw it away earlier. While digging through the garbage, Jack finds a newspaper ad for Dylar, prompting him to retrieve his pistol and get revenge on Mr. Gray. Jack tracks him down at a motel, where he discovers that Mr. Gray was the man in his hallucinations. Jack shoots him and places the gun in his hand so as to make it look like suicide. Babette unexpectedly shows up and sees a still-alive Mr. Gray, who manages to shoot them both but only injures them slightly. After Jack and Babette convince the confused Mr. Gray that he is responsible for their injuries, they take him to a nearby hospital run by German atheist nuns. There, the couple also reconcile with each other.The next day, the Gladneys shop at an A&P supermarket, where the family participates in a dance number with all the other patrons and employees.","Dramatizes a contemporary American family's attempts to deal with the mundane conflicts of everyday life while grappling with the universal mysteries of love, death, and the possibility of happiness in an uncertain world."

Levine']","During the destruction of the planet Krypton, a Kryptonian Labrador Retriever Krypto (Dwayne Johnson) comforts fellow infant survivor Kal-El as they head in an escape pod toward Earth.Years later, now known as the famous superheroes, Krypto and Superman (John Krasinski), they live in the city of Metropolis under their dual identities, Bark and Clark Kent. Clark is a reporter and journalist at the Daily Planet, a newspaper company, and dating Lois Lane (Olivia Wilde), a fellow journalist of whom Krypto is jealous. Whenever Superman is with Lois he tries to keep getting rid of Krypto, which makes him insecure.
Thinking that Krypto needs a friend to distract him, Clark heads to an animal shelter to find one. A Boxer named Ace tries to escape the shelter (he wanted to go to a place called the farm for his freedom), but Krypto stops him. Ace reveals to Krypto that Superman is inside the shelter trying to find a new companion for Krypto. This saddens him.
Later, Superman and Krypto spot their archenemy, LexCorp CEO Lex Luthor (Marc Maron), reeling in a meteor strapped with orange kryptonite with a tractor beam, intending to gain superpowers (The Orange kryptonite gives powers, instead of taking them like the green one). He is easily defeated as the two are aided by the Justice League (AQuaman (Jemaine Clement) (an Atlantean demigod, superhero, and the king of Atlantis), Cyborg (Daveed Diggs) (a former football player and superhero who gained cybernetics after an accident), Wonder Woman (Jameela Jamil) (an Amazon princess and super-heroine from Themyscira), Green Lantern (Dascha Polanco) (a super-heroine and member of the Green Lantern Corps), The Flash (John Early) (a police forensic scientist and superhero who protects Central City with his immense super-speed) & Batman (Keanu Reeves) (A vigilante superhero who protects Gotham City)).During the fight, Lex manages to break off a small piece of the orange kryptonite while the rest is flung out into space.
Meanwhile, Lulu (Kate McKinnon) (an evil hairless guinea pig who gains flight and telekinesis through Orange Kryptonite), a guinea pig test subject from LexCorp sent to the shelter, reels in a piece of orange kryptonite with her own tractor beam, which gives her flight and telekinesis. Lulu had figured out, working with Lex, that Orange Kryptonite doesn't work on people, it only works on pets. So, she took whatever parts she found in the shelter and built herself a tractor beam. Lulu uses her powers to escape with a kitten named whiskers, leaving the rest of the animals behind in the shelter.
Unbeknownst to her, everyone else in the shelter also gains superpowers. Ace (Kevin Hart) is now super-strong and indestructible; PB (Vanessa Bayer), a potbellied pig, can change size; Merton (Natasha Lyonne), a nearsighted turtle, becomes super-fast; and Chip (Diego Luna), a paranoid squirrel, gains Electrokinesis.
While at home, Superman and Krypto have an argument when the former plans to propose marriage to Lois. However, Clark is captured by Lulu who uses green kryptonite to rob Superman of his powers. Krypto tries to save him, but due to a piece of Jarlsberg cheese inside a Batman toy he ate laced with green kryptonite, he loses his powers. As Krypto wanders the streets, Dog-El (Keith David), Krypto's father appears as a holographic form from Krypto's collar. Dog-El had codified his persona in Krypto's collar before he left kryptonite. Dog-El encourages Krypto not to give up hope and continue finding Superman.
Later, Krypto comes across the shelter pets (who were enjoying their freedom in the park), who agree to help him, with Ace only agreeing after Krypto blackmails him (Ace had told the crew that they were going to a ""farm"", but Krypto knew that there was no farm and that Ace was bluffing). Krypto offers to take the entire crew to his farm, if they agree to help him save superman.Meanwhile, Lulu recruits a group of guinea pigs (whom she gives superpowers), captures the Justice League, and heads to Stryker's Island to free Luthor. The shelter pets try to stop her, but fail miserably. Krypto manages to get close to Lulu and tells her that Lex tested on her.. She was never Lex's colleague and he only used her to perfect his weapons. But Lulu tells Krypto that Superman was going to marry Lois and leave Krypto. She then tosses Krypto and his team aside.
They regroup in the Hall of Justice, where Ace tells a distraught Krypto he used to be the puppy of a family with a toddler. One day, the toddler nearly fell down the stairs when Ace bit her arm and pulled her to safety. Upon seeing the bite-marks, the parents assumed Ace attacked her and sent him to the shelter. However, Ace stands by his actions and ideals. Encouraged, Krypto leads the pets to LexCorp.
While there, a kitten named Whiskers (Winona Bradshaw), who Lulu rescued from the shelter and can now create weapons at will, attacks them and pins them down. Krypto finally learns how to get the pets working together like a team and they trap whiskers. At Stryker's Island, the shelter pets confront Lulu, but put themselves in prison cells when she threatens to kill Krypto. Lulu frees Luthor, who betrays her and locks her in his cell while freeing Mercy Graves (Maya Erskine) (Lex Luthor's Hench-woman and bodyguard). Lulu breaks out easily and decides to destroy the Justice League and Luthor herself. She plans to blow up the entire justice league by herself. If she cant have her owner, Lex, then Krypto wont have Superman.The Kryptonite passes through Krypto's system, restoring his powers. Fearing for their safety, he asks his friends to stay out of harm's way and heads to LexCorp. He defeats the guinea pigs while Lulu traps Luthor in a similar prison as the League's and launches a rocket from the building. The rocket will explode as it hits the atmosphere, killing the entire justice league and Lex with it.
This forces Krypto to choose between the Justice League or Lois, who is in a nearby helicopter. He decides to save Lois while his friends help the League. Enraged, Lulu puts the orange kryptonite in her brain, becoming a Kaiju-sized version of herself. The League and the pets team up to stop her. Realizing she has become too powerful, Krypto decides to use the ""Solar Paw Punch"" (you fly close to the sun to absorb enough energy and then slam into the villain to cause a massive explosion), a move that can defeat any super-villain, but will likely kill the user. The attack causes a massive explosion that removes the kryptonite from Lulu's brain and, shortly thereafter, her redeemed henchmen, Mark and Keith, trap her in a hot dog stand. Krypto accepts his fate, but Ace uses his invulnerability to save him.In the aftermath, Krypto allows Clark to marry Lois. The shelter pets, Mark, and Keith get adopted by the rest of the Justice League. Sometime later, the pets have formed their own superhero team called the ""League of Super-Pets"".
In a mid-credits scene, Luthor is still trapped in his prison asking any passing super-animals to free him. Meanwhile, Lulu is freed by Mercy, who adopts her.
In a post-credits scene, Krypto and Superman encounter Black Adam (Teth-Adam) and his dog, Anubis (Dwayne Johnson).

Late one night, he receives a phone call from a stranger, Ty Shaw, informing him that his ""girlfriend,"" Abilene ""Abby"" Shaw, has died of an apparent drug overdose. In actuality, Abby was one of Ben's many casual romantic relationships whom Ben barely remembers. At Ty's insistence, Ben flies to Texas to attend the funeral. He meets Abby's family: brother Ty, mother Sharon, sisters Paris and Kansas City, younger brother Mason (referred to as ""El Stupido""), and Granny Carole.Ty informs Ben that he suspects Abby was actually murdered, adamantly maintaining that she never took drugs, and asks Ben to accompany him to find the truth and avenge her. After conferring with his podcast producer Eloise, Ben elects to aid them as part of a story about grief and denial.Ben and Ty meet Ty's friend Crawl, who explains that parties often occur at the oil fields and tells Ben of an area nearby the fields dubbed ""the Afterparty"", an area between law enforcement jurisdictions where dead bodies have been reported over time. Crawl and Ty suspect Sancholo, a local drug dealer, as responsible for Abby's death. Ben meets Quentin Sellers, an eccentric record producer, in the midst of working with a teenaged female singer; like Ben, Quentin is an outsider and college-educated but has come to adopt Texas as his home. He gives Ben a memory stick with recordings of Abby performing. Ben confronts Sancholo to discuss Abby's death, who reveals he was in Tulsa at the time. Ben later joins the Shaw family at a rodeo, where he accidentally draws the crowd's ire by expressing support for the Texas Longhorns when the crowd is overwhelmingly in favor of the Texas Tech Red Raiders.Ben's car explodes. Later, Ben receives a call from Eloise, telling him that the story is complete - and his best ever - and expects him to now return to New York. At dinner with the Shaws at Whataburger, Granny mentions that Abby was, in fact, a drug user and that Ty had lied about that to Ben, wanting to get closer to her (supposed) boyfriend. Leaving the restaurant, Ben reveals that he was not close with Abby and criticizes the Shaws' lives and mentalities.Later, Mason mentions how Abby would speak in code with him, saying ""1435"" (for the letters in ""I love you mucho""). Enlightened, Ben uses the number to unlock Abby's phone, finding a contact labeled ""Ben"", which Abby did to make her family believe she was texting with a New York boyfriend (thus the Shaws' misunderstanding). The last few messages indicate that Abby was abandoned by the unknown Texas ""Ben"" as she lay dying.Armed with one of Ty's pistols, Ben rides with Mason to a party at the oil fields. Ben learns that his car was bombed by Texas Tech fans from the rodeo. Ben finds Ty and Quentin, and the latter invites him to a private tent to converse. Inside, Ben notices a stash of opioids and witnesses the teenage singer from earlier being dragged away to ""the Afterparty"". After turning off his recorder, Ben elicits a confession from Quentin, who confirms that he caused Abby to overdose and left her to die. Ben reveals that he actually recorded the confession on his phone, to which Quentin responds with a speech about the nature of Ben's story and how ever-questioning audiences will shift their negative attention from Quentin (who only ""left somebody to die"" of their own overdose) to Ben and then toward the Shaws. Ben executes Quentin with Ty's pistol.Upon returning to the Shaw house, Ben reconciles with Ty and Sharon. Before departing from Texas, Ben remotely deletes all copies of his recordings, electing to keep the story between the Shaws and himself.

During one of the marching band practices, Kevin witnesses mentally ill Scottish student Emily (Isis Hainsworth) having a full meltdown and quitting the band because of her lack of skills with the clarinet. Hunter and Kevin are struggling for funds to buy a full drums kit, as it costs a $1000.
Later that day, Kevin drags Hunter to a party at Clay Moss' (Noah Urrea) house and tries to be a normal kid while Hunter feels misplaced. Clay has his own band called the Mollycoddle.
Kevin gets drunk and flirts with a girl named Kendall (Analesa Fisher), while Hunter gets into an altercation with jock Rocky ""Skip"" Hoffman (Phelan Davis). Skip is the school bully who picks on nerds and has a thing for Hunter and Kevin.In the aftermath, Hunter discovers that the school will hold a ""Battle of the Bands"" and it prompts him to sign up his and Kevin's band named Skullfucker. Hunter has ambition to achieve fame and fortune via heavy metal, and so this competition is huge for him. Hunter is obsessed with winning. Hunter steals his father's AMEX card and spends US$ 13,500 in gear, including a full drum kit for Kevin. Kevin starts practicing at school and during one of those sessions, he discovers that Emily is in fact a skilled cello player. They become interested in each other, which prompts Kevin to give her a copy of playlist of metal songs that Hunter assigned him as a ""homework"". Meanwhile, Hunter tries to find a bassist to complete the trio, only to be unsuccessful because of lack of interest from the other students (and the fact that Hunter keeps insulting them), and has a series of run-ins with Skip (skip cuts Hunter's hair and destroys his car).Kevin unsuccessfully tries to pitch Emily as their new bassist to Hunter. HUnter is rude to Emily and says that she doesn't fit with his band's image. Afterwards, Kevin calls Emily to apologize for Hunter's behavior and they end up having sex in the back of Emily's van. Kevin and Emily become a couple, which enrages Hunter, who believes that she will be their ""Yoko Ono"". Clay hears Kevin playing drums and, since Clay's drummer is going to rehab for substance abuse, Clay asks Kevin to join his band Mollycoddle, for his sister's wedding that weekend. During a speech class, Hunter teases Emily (about how she will never understand what ""metal"" is, and that she is keeping Kevin down) to the point of her melting down, attacking him, and breaking his guitar in the process. Those two facts lead to an argument between Hunter and Kevin, who leaves Skullfucker.Kevin performs with Mollycoddle at Clay's sister's wedding, while Hunter tries to break into the wedding to get Kevin back into Skullfucker and is arrested for trespassing. Afterwards, Kevin is invited to hang out with Clay's friends and to perform with Mollycoddle on the Battle of Bands, which he reluctantly accepts. Kendall invites a drunk Kevin into the pool and flirts with him. While they make out, Kevin's conscience materializes in the form of heavy-metal musicians Scott Ian, Tom Morello, Kirk Hammett and Rob Halford. Halford makes Kevin realize that he indeed loves Emily and gets back with her. Kevin also realizes that he needs Hunter back, only to discover that Hunter was sent to rehab by his father (Brett Gelman), as a punishment for his misbehavior.Hunter discovers that the clinic is run by Dr. Troy Nix (Joe Manganiello), famed lead guitarist of metal band Killoton and former Battle of the Bands champion; Nix explains that Killoton broke up because of his alcohol abuse and fraught relationships among the band members, which prompted Nix to get his life straight, become a doctor and help other addicts. Dr. Nix says that, while Hunter is fit for discharge, it won't happen until the next week because of the clinic's policies. Kevin breaks into the clinic and breaks out Hunter and Mollycoddle's drummer; they run into Dr. Nix during their escape, but Nix lets them go after giving Hunter a better guitar pick.

As Kevin and Hunter are getting ready for their performance as a duo Emily appears to perform with them with an electric cello and decked out in gothic-metal attire. Just as they're about to take the stage, Dean Swanson (Sufe Bradshaw) warns them that the name ""Skullfucker"" is inappropriate for the event, forcing Emily to quickly change the band's name to Skullflower.

But it's only after some persuasion from Karina (Vanessa Hudgens), i.e., Meadow's best friend, and from Ky and Jimmy, that the neighbors finally take the plunge into a whirlwind romance. Things go rather smoothly because it's the ""honeymoon period."" They go on vacation together. The sex is good. They meet each other's friends. However, one night, a little misunderstanding in the form of Carmen creeps into Jabari and Meadow's lives.Upon noticing that Jabari's phone is buzzing, Meadow unlocks it and sees that Carmen has sent a photo of herself wearing nothing but Jabari's red hoodie, along with the messages ""you left this here yesterday"" and ""some things always fit."" We get a flashback that Jabari went to Carmen to get rid of a rat in her house. While dealing with it, he took off his hoodie. But after running out of the house due to the enormity of the rat, Jabari never came back to retrieve the hoodie. Hence the picture.
As Meadow starts to cold shoulder Jabari, he goes back to Carmen's to not only get the hoodie, but also to clear it out that they aren't ""friends with benefits."" They are strictly friends because Jabari is in a relationship with Meadow. With that out of the way, Jabari heads over to Meadow's to clear things up with her. However, since she isn't in the mood to listen and Jabari isn't very good at explaining, they end up putting a pause on their relationship.Post their breakup, both Jabari and Meadow dive headfirst into their work. While Meadow prepares for her art presentation, Jabari prepares his demonstration for the Mr. Rager comic. But their personal lives begin to suck. They even avoid running into each other.
When Jabari's comic gets green-lit, he types in the message to inform Meadow but doesn't hit ""send."" One of the artists who is co-presenting with Meadow, Nadia (070 Shake), lauds her for the picture of Jabari she had snapped. However, Meadow says that that portrait isn't going to be in the presentation because it doesn't have a place there. That's literal and metaphorical in nature because Meadow isn't sure if she can accommodate Jabari, someone who she doesn't trust right now, in her life anymore. And it's literal because, subconsciously, Meadow has composed her presentation in a way that the picture of Jabari just won't fit anywhere.Jabari's sister Ellie (Maisha Mescudi) pays him a visit to knock some sense into him. She tells him that he shouldn't let his pride get in the way of trying hard enough to win Meadow's trust back. Then, she basically spells out the ethos of ""Entergalactic"" by saying: ""Love is the easiest thing in the world when it happens by accident, but it doesn't get real until you do it on purpose."" Jabari and Meadow live beside each other by chance. They ran into each other by chance. And their personalities match with each other by chance. But the moment they have to put some real effort into ensuring they've got a future together, they are cutting and running. Yes, you can say that Meadow isn't as much at fault as Jabari is because his inability to draw lines caused this whole misunderstanding. Jabari should've realized that and made more of an effort to make amends.Ellie manages to motivate Jabari to not only attend Meadow's presentation but also make a grand gesture by turning the nearby McDonald's poster into a Mr. Rager street art. Meadow sees that and understands that Jabari is telling her to meet him at her secret spot, The Greasy Spoon. Jabari cycles to the restaurant while Meadow takes a cab. After reaching there, they make out and become a couple again. A news reporter informs us that the dating app, Stush, which looms heavily over the movie, has been accused of defrauding its customers by acquiring their credit card details.","Jabari, a charming, streetwear-clad artist on the cusp of real success. After a chance run-in with his cool new photographer neighbor, Meadow, Jabari has to figure out whether he can make space for love in his life."

After realizing he didn't take Trudy to the mall to see Santa, Jason implores Linda to make up with him with Jason promising to quit his job working for Gertrude and leave it all behind. He finds an old walkie talkie which he gives to Trudy to ""talk to Santa.""Santa arrives at the Lightstone estate to deliver gifts, when the catering staff and some servants reveal themselves to be part of a group of mercenaries, led by a man known as ""Mr. Scrooge"" where they all use Christmas code-names, and take the family hostage. Santa gets into a fight with one of the henchmen whose gunfire scares away the reindeer. Santa inadvertently kills the henchman when a string of Christmas lights pulls him out of the window and is impaled on an icicle decoration outside. Santa later kills another henchman, stabbing him in the eye with a tree topper, before plugging it in and electrocuting him. Taking the henchman's walkie talkie, Santa accidentally finds Trudy's channel and, seeing that she is on his nice list, decides to help save her while also finding that all the mercenaries are on his naughty list.Over the course of the night, it is revealed that Mr. Scrooge is after $300 million given to the Lightstone company to funnel oil into the Middle East, but was stolen by Gertrude and kept in the mansion's vault. When Trudy's walkie talkie is discovered, Jason and Linda attempt to convince the mercenaries that Trudy is simply playing make-believe. When she refuses to go along, Jason tells her that Santa isn't real causing her to run and hide in the attic. Over the walkie, Santa reveals that before he was Santa, he was a Viking warrior, giving context to his barbaric nature. He confirms to her that he is real by telling her about the letters she wrote to him.

The squad's commander Thorpe opens the vault which contains nothing. With a gun to Linda's head, Jason confesses that he stole the money and was planning to escape with Linda and Trudy, which shocks everyone but Gertrude, who learned of this from Jason's gift that she was forced to open by Scrooge's lead henchman Krampus but acknowledged as part of a Lightstone rite of passage.Santa retreats to a shed where he discovers a hammer. Inspired, he brutally slaughters the kill squad before rushing to save Trudy. Upstairs, Trudy creates traps inspired by Home Alone. This leads to Gingerbread being killed by a bowling ball driving a nail into his head.

Suddenly, her mother knocks on the door and wants to be let in. Ann ignores her and leaves the door locked. Ann's mother continues to plead with her to open the door. Her mother begins violently banging against the door to try to get in. Finally, we see Ann's mother is banging her head against the door, clearly possessed by something.Years later, an adult Ann (Jacqueline Byers), has become a nun who is currently on assignment, assisting at St. Michael the Archangel School of Exorcism in Boston. Sister Ann helps in the medical ward, attending to patients' daily needs (bathing, feeding, etc.). One day, she befriends a young girl, a patient named Natalie (Posy Taylor).Ann is curious about the ways of exorcism and occasionally sneaks into an exorcism class taught by Father Quinn (Colin Salmon). She is later admonished because nuns are prohibited from being taught the ways of exorcisms. Priests can only perform the act of exorcism.One afternoon, Ann gives a sponge bath to a patient when he suddenly attacks her. He begins speaking in a different voice and says something that reminds Ann of what her mother used to say when she was possessed. The entire incident is caught on a security camera. Father Quinn is convinced that this demonic spirit will continue to target Ann and that she should know how to defend herself. After Father Quinn convinces the Cardinal, Ann is allowed to attend exorcism classes.Father Quinn takes the students to see an exorcism in person during her first class. The possessed individual is revealed to be Natalie. Two students, Father Dante and Father Raymond are selected to try their hand at leading the exorcism. When it goes awry, Father Quinn tries to exorcise the demon from Natalie, but she gets the upper hand. Ann eventually runs into the room and can appeal to Natalie, and the demonic spirit leaves. Later, Ann is informed that the demonic entity merely retreated because it felt threatened, thus making the exorcism unsuccessful. Natalie is informed to be a terminal case.As Ann continues to be plagued by the same demonic spirit, she looks into records of individuals that were considered terminal cases. With Father Dante's help, Ann can access the hidden records of those patients, only finding one woman who could survive. Still, her face is heavily scarred as a result of the exorcism. All the other patients died.Father Dante later reveals to Ann that he believes his pregnant sister is being possessed and wants Ann to lead an unauthorized exorcism. Since she had some success with Natalie, Ann decided to help. After an intense session, Ann can release the demon's hold on Dante's sister.In a private moment afterward, Ann tells Dante that she became pregnant with a little girl before she became a nun. Instead of choosing to raise her daughter, Ann gave her up for adoption right after the baby was born.Ann is called into a meeting with Father Quinn and the Cardinal the next day. They reveal to Ann that shortly after their session with Father Dante's sister, she committed suicide. As a result, Ann chooses to return to her monastery, St. Mary's.Father Dante later goes to see Ann at St. Mary's to tell her that Natalie was released, but shortly afterward, Natalie experiences a relapse and is transported by ambulance back to the hospital. But, when the ambulance arrived, the doors were opened to reveal that Natalie had killed everyone inside the vehicle. Father Dante gives Ann a necklace that Natalie is holding in her hand. Ann looks at the necklace and tells Dante that this necklace is the same one she gave her daughter when she was born, thus revealing that Natalie is Ann's daughter.Dante convinces Ann to help lead another unauthorized exorcism. So, he sneaks Ann into the catacombs under St. Michael's, where Natalie is being held. Natalie eventually breaks out and kills several priests, one of which is Father Raymond. After a struggle, Ann convinces the demonic spirit to release Natalie and take her instead. So, the spirit leaves Natalie, who hides with Father Dante, and goes into Sister Ann.Ann becomes possessed and begins hunting Natalie in the catacombs. Ann dispatches Dante, leaving him unconscious. As Natalie hides near a fountain filled with holy water, the possessed Ann attacks her. Ann's normal self eventually comes to and wrestles with the demon inside of her. As she physically battles with the spirit, her body falls into the fountain, and the holy water purges the spirit out of Ann's body. Ann is rescued from the water and reunites with Natalie and Dante.Ann recovers in the hospital but can say goodbye to Natalie. Natalie reunites with her adopted mother as Ann looks on. As a result of what happened, Ann is rewarded with an academic scholarship to study at the Vatican. As she says her goodbyes to Father Quinn, he reminds her that he knows who she is now that she has battled with the devil.On her way to the airport in a cab, Ann spots a woman staring at her on the street. The woman eventually appears beside Ann's window, sporting white eyes. Ann looks in front and sees that the cab driver is no longer in the driver's seat. He is now beside her in the backseat.

Many people remain fans of Samaritan, and there are constant rumors that he is still alive.Twenty five years later, thirteen-year-old Sam Cleary tries his best to help his mother with their financial crisis, and, after being threatened with eviction, he accepts a job from a gang headed by Reza. The plan goes awry and Reza tries to blame Sam, but the real gang leader, Cyrus, is impressed and personally gives Sam $110. Reza and his friends later attack Sam as payback but are stopped by Joe Smith, a garbage collector who lives in an apartment across from Sam's. Joe displays super-strength in fighting off the gang members, and Sam suspects that he is Samaritan.

While playing outside in the field, the boys discover the barn. Exploring inside, Elias finds old toys of theirs. Mother discovers they've been in the barn and chastises them, proclaiming that from then on they will stay indoors.The boys quickly sense something strange about Mother, who does not seem interested in reconnecting with them; she drinks heavily, appears angry, and will not sing the lullaby she always used to sing to them as children. Elias also discovers Mother has thrown away a drawing he made of the three of them, which upsets him. During the night, Elias overhears Mother talking on the phone; she says she cannot go on pretending and wants him gone.After seeing an old headshot of Mother with green eyes, who now has blue eyes, the boys begin to question whether the woman they are living with is really their mother.

Meanwhile, Tom is setting up a surprise for Darcy on a motorboat but gets startled by the security guard, causing him to fall into the water.Tom's mother, Carol (Jennifer Coolidge), arrives with her second husband, Larry (Steve Coulter). At the same time, Darcy's father, Robert (Cheech Marin), shows up with his new younger girlfriend, Harriet (D'Arcy Carden), which annoys Renata since she still hates Robert after their divorce. While Darcy and Tom try to spend time together, Tom gets pulled away by his best friend/best man Ricky (Desmin Borges), leaving Darcy to be with her younger sister Jamie (Callie Hernandez). Complicating matters is the arrival of Darcy's charming ex-boyfriend Sean (Lenny Kravitz), who was invited by Robert. He calls Darcy ""Dee Dee,"" and his presence puts Tom on edge, with everyone seeing he is clearly jealous. Tom delivers a speech that is upstaged by Sean's more personal speech toward Darcy. This is followed by Tom's sister Jeannie (Melissa Hunter) delivering a speech discussing her recent marital problems.Darcy and Tom try to wind down and get intimate with one another, but it is interrupted by Carol coming in to offer words that she thinks are encouraging, but they really aren't. The couple ends up sleeping separately.The next morning is wedding day. As preparations are being made, a group of pirates makes their way toward the island after seeing the couple's wedding website. Darcy is helped by Renata, Jamie, and Carol into her dress, but she feels that something isn't right. She texts Tom to meet privately, and Darcy says she feels that having everyone come to the Philippines for their wedding was too much, as she never wanted a big wedding. They argue until they decide that they ought to call off the wedding, just as the pirates storm the resort and take the staff and guests hostage. Tom witnesses this and runs to warn Darcy. The pirates force everyone into a pool and demand a $45 million ransom from Robert, as they know how wealthy he is.Tom gets Darcy out of her room and tells her what's happening. They see an armed pirate attempting to break in and try to come up with a plan to trap him. While they attempt to subdue him with their own ideas (Tom wants to trap him in a net while Darcy thinks spraying his eyes with hairspray would do the trick), they both get taken down and are tied up together. The pirates then head with the couple to bring them to their leader, but Darcy asks for a cigarette and uses it to light the pirates' heads on fire, causing them to jump out and leaving the couple to try and take control of the driver less cart. They manage to jump out, but Darcy's dress gets caught and is mostly ripped off as the cart falls over a cliff. They are then attacked by one of the pirates, but Darcy manages to pull a grenade from his hand, and Tom kicks him and makes him fall against a rock, killing him. This leaves him mortified at killing a man.Darcy and Tom try to find a way to untie themselves, but Tom informs Darcy to be careful with the grenade she is holding because it doesn't have a pin in it, and her dropping it could set it off. They try to find an area with good cell reception so they can call for help, but they get chased by more pirates, and Darcy drops the phone. They find a zip line tower where they descend, and Darcy drops the grenade on two pirates, which alerts the others to their location when it blows up. When the couple lands, they are scared to see their loved ones being held hostage and try to find a way to get help.The couple goes into the kitchen to find a way to cut their bindings. A female pirate enters just as they cut themselves free with a deli slicer (but Tom gets a nasty cut on his hand that makes Darcy faint). Tom fights the pirate until he knocks her out by smashing her through a glass window. When Darcy comes to her senses, she shortens her dress and wears boots so she can spring into action and help Tom save their loved ones.Darcy and Tom find the main office of the resort but find that they have no internet. The owners, Margy (Selena Tan) and Ace (Alberto Isaac), hide the couple in their bunker. While tending to Tom's wound, Margy lets it slip that the resort was hit by pirates the previous summer, which Tom had known about. Darcy yells at Tom over this and his habit of self-sabotaging and his insecurities, which is what led him to make the big wedding. Tom hits back that Darcy is putting on a big front of being confident when she is also scared. Tom then takes responsibility for the hostages since he brought them all there. When another pirate starts getting close, Ace and Margy send the couple down a tunnel, but Tom gets out and turns himself in to be captured, leaving Darcy hidden.Tom is brought to the other hostages. He tells the lead pirate a phrase in Balinese (which means ""fuck your grandpa""), and he then holds Sean at knife-point. Tom deduced that Sean is the bad guy who hired the pirates because Sean had said the phrase earlier, and Tom figured the pirates are Balinese. He even produces a wedding invitation that one of the pirates had, and Tom states that Sean had hoped to get the ransom from Robert since he did not give him investment money. Sean drops the act and breaks free, joining the pirates and holding a gun at Tom.Darcy begins to feel bad while staying with Ace and Margy over her argument with Tom, so she is encouraged to save everyone herself. Sean takes the lead pirate with him to go find Darcy, using Harriet as collateral and taking her with him in his helicopter. Darcy arrives with a gun and tries to reconcile with Tom before taking on the pirates. The pirates end up taking Darcy with the other hostages, with one of the pirates personally wanting to kill Darcy because she burned his face.

Carol had turned down appearing in the fifth film in favor of doing the aforementioned panned role, and she fears that her former Cliff Beasts cast-mates may hold a grudge against her for abandoning them and the franchise. She is forced to take the role as her previous film bombed, where she played a half Israeli, half Palestinian, fighting aliens.Paula (Kate McKinnon), the studio executive overseeing the Cliff Beasts franchise (who is holidaying at a ski resort, while the shoot is on). Gavin (Peter Serafinowicz), executive producer of the Cliff Beasts franchise. Scott Dawson (Nick Kocher), the behind-the-scenes stills photographer. Bola (Samson Kayo), the cast coordinator. Gunther (Harry Trevaldwyn), the awkward COVID safety officer. Gavin reports to Paula, who reports to Tom (John Lithgow), the studio chairman.
Ronjon (Vir Das), the owner of the hotel playing host to the Cliff Beasts 6 cast and crew.One of the first major film productions to begin shooting in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cliff Beasts cast arrive at a swanky English hotel and must self-quarantine for two weeks prior to the shoot. During these two weeks, Carol slowly loses her sanity being stuck in her room. After this period is over, a welcome back party is organized for the cast and crew. Here, Carol happily reunites with co-stars Dustin (David Duchovny) (the workaholic lead of the Cliff Beasts franchise who portrays the character Dr. Hal Packard), Howie (Guz Khan) (an actor who portrays Jarrar, the comic relief character) and Sean (Keegan-Michael Key) (an actor who portrays the Cliff Beasts character Colt Rockwell and promotes himself as a wellness guru when not on-camera) but has an awkward meeting with Lauren (Leslie Mann) (an actress who portrays a Cliff Beasts fan favorite character named Dolly), the only Cliff Beasts co-star that appears bitter after Carol's abandonment.The party also welcomes two series newcomers, Dieter ((Pedro Pascal) a serious veteran actor portraying a new character and tragic villain named Gio), a respected, but indifferent veteran actor, and Krysta (Iris Apatow) (a TikTok superstar who joins the Cliff Beasts 6 cast as the character Vivian Joy), a young TikTok sensation brought in to attract a younger demographic. The latter quickly forms an alliance with Carla (Galen Hopper) (the daughter of the stunt coordinator and Gavin's production assistant), a deadpan on-set production assistant who's around her age.Director Darren Eigan (Fred Armisen) (a former indie filmmaker hired to direct Cliff Beasts 6), an enthusiastic, but frazzled indie filmmaker tries to boost team morale and make the shoot something special but comes off as pretentious. Darren clashes with leading man Dustin, who constantly bombards Darren with revised versions of the film's script to fit his own vision. Dieter harbors a crush on Anika (Maria Bakalova), the hotel's sweet front desk clerk, and hits on her. She responds that she's interested but wants to build a proper relationship with him first before jumping into sex.
As Dieter gets more and more starved for sex, he proceeds to have intercourse with Kate (Daisy Ridley), an exercise AI after a drug binge.Shooting begins and for the first few days, everything appears to be going according to plan. Sean humorously learns to fly a helicopter up and down. However, a rocky series of events occur that repeatedly delay the production even further. During a group meditation session, Howie succumbs to paranoia and quits the film in a panic. As a result, Howie's Cliff Beasts character is killed off in a gruesome display. Bored in the hotel, Krystal and Carla sneak out and go partying in the city. This gains traction online and gets Krystal canceled for her behavior, losing her a large portion of followers.Later the cast tests positive for influenza, linked to a delivery girl who had brought them all their coffee. Despite their sicknesses, the studio forces them to film, leading to them all violently vomiting during an intense shoot. The cast is told to self-quarantine yet again. Introduced is the mysterious Mr. Best (Ross Lee), who claims to be the head of a new security team sent by the studio to watch over the cast and the film's production. Best installs location detectors on all crew to keep an eye on their movements.Day 61. While in the hotel, Carol's boyfriend breaks up with her over the phone. A dejected Carol ends up encountering a handsome member of a football team who's residing at the hotel. Carol nearly has a fling with him before he reveals he's married and that he already has multiple girlfriends and mistresses. Infuriated, Carol tries to rally together her cast-mates and fight for their rights as workers, as they are being forced to work during illness.
Day 94. When the shoot starts back up again, Carol realizes that almost all of her character's dialogue and actions have been either given to Krystal or omitted. Humiliated after shooting a scene where Dr. Lacey urinates in fear, Carol suspects this is the studio's way of getting back at her for leaving the franchise, and for complaining to the studio. Carol has a heart-to-heart with Darren (in the swimming pool, where he tries to come on to her) and tells him of her concerns, Darren promises to talk to the higher-ups about giving Carol her dialogue back but this backfires.Lauren tries to escape from the hotel in a frenzy one night, after a fight with Dustin. Mr. Best's men graphically shoot one of her hands off, leaving her in the hospital for the remainder of the shoot. Mr. Best claims that his men thought Lauren was a crazed fan that had wandered onto the premises, but the cast theorizes that Mr. Best himself is the crazed fan who wants them to complete the movie by any means necessary.
Carol speaks to her agent Marti (Rob Delaney), and says that the studio is mistreating the actors and this way they would be shooting the movie forever. Marti counters that as per contract she needs to complete the movie or she would owe the studio 114 MM dollars.
Darren announces that after completing Cliff Beasts 6, the cast will roll right into shooting Cliff Beast 7. Krystal helps Carol shoot a video message to all her fans on TikTok, but Carla intervenes and deletes the video, saying that Carol sounds like a whining celebrity, which is not what the world wants.One night, the remaining cast take drugs together and bond over the grievances they've been having not only with the shoot but also with themselves. Shortly afterwards, they film an elaborate dancing TikTok with Krystal. During this Dieter collapses due to the drugs. The cast quickly works together in an attempt to revive him but to no avail. However, Anika manages to revive him, cementing their relationship. This event inspires Carol, noticing the cast's long-forgotten effective teamwork. The reinvigorated friendship proves strong and they organize a getaway plan. As they shoot the climax, Dustin creates a distraction by clashing with Darren about the script revisions while the rest of the cast members leave the set and try to avoid getting caught by Mr. Best and his men.Carla reveals she was a studio mole put in place to befriend Krystal and spy on the cast, leading to a live-streamed fistfight between the two girls. Meanwhile, Carol is chased down and nearly caught by a relentless Mr. Best but is saved at the last moment when Howie returns and incapacitates Mr. Best with a bow. The cast meets up at the helipad, calling upon an unsure Sean to fly them out. A furious Darren tries to stop them from leaving, only to be knocked out by Dustin. Inside the helicopter, they find Anika, who hopes to run away with Dieter, an offer he happily accepts. Sean is able to get the helicopter up off the ground but doesn't know how to fly it forward. With encouragement from the rest of the crew ( a YouTube video from Krystal), Sean successfully flies the helicopter away from the hotel as the Cliff Beasts cast celebrate their victory.Two years later, a behind the scenes documentary detailing the troubled production and crazy antics on the set entitled Beasts of the Bubble is released to rave reviews and praise from the public. While Carol is described as ""the villain"" of the film, she's proud of the project. Dieter and Anika's relationship is still strong. Lauren is seen to be in good spirits, having been fitted with a robotic hand. Meanwhile, Darren is signed on to direct a movie based on Skittles candy.",A group of actors and actresses stuck inside a pandemic bubble at a hotel attempt to complete a film.

Peter teaches Nemo how to maintain the lighthouse and tells her wild bedtime stories about his adventures with a character named Flip and one of their adventures involve the searching for a cave of magical wish-granting pearls, the sea of nightmares, the most dangerous waters known to man.One day, a storm occurs and Peter heads out to help a distressed boat. Nemo has a nightmare of her underwater as Peter is snatched by a squid-like shape. After Nemo wakes up from her nightmare, Carla (Yanna McIntosh) informs Nemo that her father is now lost at sea. As a result, Carla contacts Nemo's doorknob salesman uncle Philip (Chris O'Dowd) and persuades him to take Nemo in before she becomes a ward of the state. Philip is shown to lead a monotonous and unfulfilled life.Nemo is awakened one night when her stuffed pig (named Pig) comes to life, finding herself in Slumberland, the world between dreams. She is carried back to the lighthouse by her animated bed, where she meets Flip (Jason Momoa), a stubborn and unscrupulous outlaw (a con artist with sharp teeth and the ears and horns of a goat who becomes Nemo's companion and was a former friend of Nemo's father Peter). Nemo recognizes Flip as the character from the stories her father told. He asks Nemo about a magical map (which has the picture of an oyster and a pearl on it), but she is unaware of it. Flip knows that Nemo wants to see Peter again and says he will arrange that if she brings back the map. With no use for Nemo, Flip pushes her off a cliff to wake her up.Awake, Nemo struggles to adjust to her new life and is an outcast at school as she meets school counselor Ms. Arya (India De Beaufort) and a student named Jamal (Ali Asghar Shah). Arya tells Philip to connect with Nemo and he tries hard. He even teaches her how to pick locks.
Nemo then finds the map in the waking world (it was hidden on the back of a painting in Nemo's belongings that were sent from the lighthouse) and manages to take it back to Slumberland (she marks herself as on a trip on the school app for a few days, without telling Philip (whom she tells that she is spending the next few days at school) and goes to sleep in a hammock hung deep inside the school's steam rooms), where Flip begrudgingly agrees to take her with him to the pearls so she can wish her father into her dreams. This is dangerous as they have to travel through other people's dreams. If you die in your own dream, you wake up. If you die in someone else's dream, you don't wake up, ever.
There are secret doors connecting dreams to each other and the map helps you navigate through them to get to the sea of nightmares, where the pearls are.Flip tells Nemo that he has refused to wake up for so long he no longer remembers who he was when awake. He uses the map as a guide through various dreams to get to the cave. They travel through multiple dreams of different people and are attacked by a cloud of smoke resembling a Kraken, a personification of the nightmare of Nemo's father being taken by the same creature. Flip says that nightmares can smell the fear and they chase you through dreams until they get you.The duo also find themselves being chased down by Agent Green (Weruche Opia) of the Bureau of Subconscious Activities (BoSA), who wants to imprison Flip for never waking up and intruding dreams. They use more dreams to flee Green but are eventually caught and locked up. Green locks Flip up and warns Nemo that she cannot control her dreams (as those are controlled by BOSA, and they give her she needs and not what she wants) (Green says if Nemo doesn't learn to let go, then the nightmares will catch up with her and destroy her. She has to move on to other things in life) (She also says that the magic pearls are a myth, there is no such thing) before waking her up.In the waking world, Philip shows Nemo an old video tape of him and Peter as children playing together. Nemo realizes that Flip is Philip's dream alter-ego. Philip was a shy introverted kid and Peter was his only friend. Philip invented Flip as his alter-ego as he could be who-ever he wanted in Slumberland. when Peter went ahead and got married, Philip got left behind and even lonelier than before.
As Flip has not woken up, Philip remains docile and unadventurous in the waking world. Nemo borrows Philip's lock-picking tools and goes to Slumberland to rescue Flip from the BoSA. The two use more dreams to flee Green, finding their way back to the lighthouse. Nemo tells Flip who he is, and he rebukes this (as he doesn't want to be the doorknob seller), stating that he will never wake up. Before she can dive into the ocean to find the pearls, Nemo is awakened and torn out of Slumberland by Ms. Arya. When Philip is called in, Ms. Arya reports on Nemo's progress in school. This leads to an argument between Nemo and Philip.That night, Nemo sneaks out of Philip's apartment and sails through rough water back to the lighthouse in the waking world. She hits her head and passes out in the boat, sending her back into Slumberland. In the Sea of Nightmares, Nemo acquires a wishing pearl, but is chased by the nightmare. Flip arrives to save her in an airplane, and they crash their way through the various dreams from earlier which also awakens their inhabitants. In the waking world, Nemo slips off the small sailboat and into the water. Philip arranges a rescue boat manned by Carla and two co-workers and heads towards the lighthouse, terrified by the storm. The nightmare grabs Flip and Nemo uses her wish to force Flip to wake up. In the waking world, Philip is emboldened and dives into the water to rescue Nemo, who is unconscious.In Slumberland, Green finds Nemo and commends her on using her wish to save Flip. Green gives Nemo another pearl which she uses to see her father again. Peter appears and the two spend some quality time together before he tells Nemo he is proud of her, and that life is waiting for her in the waking world. Nemo says goodbye to her father and wakes up, where Phillip embraces her, now embedded with the personality of Flip.Nemo begins to improve her life in the waking world, making friends at school and repairing her relationship with her uncle as they make use of one of Peter's boats for sailing.","A young girl discovers a secret map to the dreamworld of Slumberland, and with the help of an eccentric outlaw, she traverses dreams and flees nightmares, with the hope that she will be able to see her late father again."

She is shown to be burning some official looking papers, sharpening her knife and cleaning her guns. She is preparing for something. She is shown to be attempting a suicide, by pointing her own gun at herself.The film starts earlier in the day, with Lou shooting a deer and then going to the bank to empty her account. Lou knows that she missed her deer shot by 4 inches. She has arthritis in her wrists. A big storm is headed into town and the residents are battering down the hatches to secure their homes. A hidden person is stalking Lou.
A mother, Hannah (Jurnee Smollett), playing hide-and-seek with her young daughter, Vee (Ridley Bateman), outside their home. Lou (Allison Janney), the landlady and loner living with her dog Jax, stops by to say the rent is due the next day. Hannah wants an extension as she had to buy supplies for the storm, but Lou refuses. She is a person of few words and hard. Lou almost hits Vee on her way out and tells Hannah to teach Vee to look out for herself. Hannah is livid at Lou for driving fast.
While in the village buying some supplies, Lou talks to the sheriff Rankin (Matt Craven) about her arthritis. He tells her a copper bracelet could help her condition.Expecting a large storm, Chris (Greyston Holt), Hannah's male friend, offers to bring supplies. He picks up a hitchhiker who kills him in his van. The hitchhiker cuts power to Hannah's home, and, while she is outside trying to restore power, he kidnaps Vee and flees with her on foot. Hannah, meanwhile, finds Chris's van and finds him dead inside. She rushes back home to find Vee missing. On her bed is a photo of a young Vee with a man.
Hannah runs to Lou's house, interrupts her suicide attempt (after Lou left Hannah her house and all her belongings, indicating that she loved Hannah and Vee from her heart) (Lou was committing suicide based on certain recent news events, which indicates that Lou had something to do with them. and she felt that her actions left the world a more dangerous place), and tells her Vee is missing. Hannah suspects that Vee's father Philip has kidnapped her.
Lou's truck blows up due to a bomb set by the hitchhiker. Hannah and Lou set off tracking him and Vee into the night during the storm. Lou knows Philip will try to take Vee off the island, but airports and ferries are closed due to the storm. He must be headed to the coast, to catch his private vehicle.Hannah informs Lou that the hitchhiker is Vee's father, Philip (Logan Marshall-Green), a special forces soldier and criminal she thought was dead. Lou finds and kills Philip's friends Tony (Daniel Bernhardt) & Gerry (RJ Fetherstonhaugh) on the way, clearly showing she is more than she appears to be. She explains to Hannah she is an ex-CIA field agent of 26 years. Before dying Tony tells Lou that Philip is headed to Eagle Bay. Hannah uses Tony's radio to contact the sheriff, and this tips off Philip.
Lou and Hannah track Philip and Vee to the beach at Eagle Bay. Philiphad been leaving clues for Lou all over the trail, which she hides from Hannah. Lou sends Hannah to radio for help, while she goes to confront Philip and rescue Vee. After a standoff, it is revealed Philip is actually Lou's son, who tracked them down after she turned him in and hid them for protection. It is also revealed that Lou abandoned Philip to not blow her undercover mission. Philip feels Lou chose the over CIA over him.
Lou reveals that she thought that Philip was dead (as revealed by Hannah earlier that Philip died in an explosion in his own house). She says she only protected Hannah and Vee and thought her mission was complete.
Philip injures Lou and leaves with Vee, intending to kill all of them together.Hannah contacts the sheriff, but a call from the marshal's service forces him to stand down, as it's a federal case now. Meanwhile Hannah finds Lou, who tells her the story between her and Philip. Lou says that after she heard Philip died, she got her friend to run into Hannah and persuade her to move to Orcas Island. Lou knew that one day they will need protection. Hannah is angry and leaves Lou to go after Philip at the Lighthouse.
The sheriff goes to Eagle Bay nonetheless, where he finds Lou and gives her a copper bracelet for her wrist. Lou tells sheriff that CIA is looking for her she kept evidence of their wrongdoing in Iran. Meanwhile, Hannah arrives at the lighthouse and manages to get Vee away from Philip. After a scuffle, Hannah injures Philip and flees with Vee.
Lou finds the lighthouse filled with explosives and sets them off from a distance, destroying it to signal an approaching CIA helicopter. Lou tells Hannah to head towards town with Vee, as she holds up Philip. Lou and Philip fight on the beach, until she gains the upper hand and hugs him. She apologizes as a CIA agent fires on them, and both Lou and Philip go under the water's surface.Later, Hannah and Vee are shown in Lou's house, packed up and ready to leave. After a few questions from CIA agents and a goodbye from the sheriff, they are seen on-board a ferry with Jax, who looks at someone on the upper deck, not fully in frame. The camera shifts to show a woman's arm with a similar scar that Lou had and a copper bracelet, as she watches the three through binoculars.","A storm rages. A young girl is kidnapped.

Johnny was held back by a year and gets harsher treatment from their teacher when they both joke around in class. Paul often disassociates from his schoolwork and draws pictures instead.Paul lives with his financially stable family of Jewish heritage. He is close with his maternal grandfather Aaron Rabinowitz, who encourages him to pursue his aspirations of becoming an artist. His well-meaning but strict parents, Esther and Irving, are less convinced by Paul's career prospects to be an artist. At night, Aaron tells Paul the story of how Aaron's mother escaped antisemitic persecution in Ukraine, fleeing to London before eventually immigrating to the United States with Aaron and her British husband.One day, Paul and Johnny are caught smoking a joint in the restrooms, unaware that it's an illegal drug. Furious, Esther allows Irving to beat Paul as punishment. In the hope that he becomes more disciplined, Paul is sent to the Forest Manor Prep private school by his parents,[5] where his older brother Ted is studying. Meanwhile, Johnny stops going to public school following Paul's expulsion.Forest Manor is financially supported by famous businessman Fred Trump, who also supports Ronald Reagan in the upcoming US presidential election. Many of the students are also Reagan supporters. On Paul's first day, Fred's daughter Maryanne, one of the school's famous alumni, delivers a speech to the students about working to earn their success. Paul sees the school's advantages over his previous schooling but still doesn't feel welcome at the school. Paul is also unnerved by racist comments from other students when Johnny meets with him during playtime outdoors. Johnny also begins living in secret at Paul's clubhouse, having nowhere to go other than living with his sick grandmother, where foster system workers searching for Johnny have begun to visit regularly.While playing at the park on the weekend, Paul tells Aaron of his struggles at school and how he does nothing when he witnesses racism from the other students. Aaron encourages Paul to stand up against prejudice when he sees it; reminding Paul that while antisemitism still covertly persists, he and his family still have the privilege of being white. Shortly after, Aaron dies of bone cancer, with the family mourning his loss.Tired of living under high expectations from family and school, as well as the unfair treatment of Johnny, Paul convinces Johnny of his plan to steal a computer from school and sell it for money, so they can run away together. Although they successfully steal the computer, they are arrested by the police for trying to sell it. While being interrogated, Paul confesses that it was all his plan, to protect Johnny. However, knowing that he has no options in life, Johnny takes the blame to let Paul go, much to Paul's dismay. Paul and Johnny bid farewell, as Irving arrives to take him home with no consequences due to an officer being an old friend of Irving's. At home, Irving confesses to Paul that he is sympathetic to his frustration with America's unfair racial inequality, but tells him that they need to survive to have a good life. The two agree to not tell Esther what happened, as she is still mourning the loss of her father.Days later, the Graff family are disappointed by Reagan's victory in the election, while Paul is focused on schoolwork. During a Thanksgiving dance at school, Fred Trump addresses the students, expressing hope that they'll become the next successful elite.

Hector is forced to move out and reluctantly leaves Lyle to fend for himself while he tries to make more money. Eighteen months later, Mr. and Mrs. Primm and their young son Josh move into the house.

After Toronto leaves, the suspect is shot and killed by the man who called Toronto.Teddy is getting ready to celebrate his anniversary with his wife Lori (Jasmine Mathews).

While Marty likes Teddy, he has no choice but to fire him.Toronto returns home and begins preparing his breakfast when he is contacted by his Handler (Ellen Barkin). Although Toronto just wants to take it easy, The Handler tells him that the next contract he has lined up is worth $2 million.Teddy and Lori arrive at the spa where he is treating her for their anniversary. After dropping her off, he heads to what he believes is the AirBNB based off the reservation he printed out. Due to misreading it, Teddy ends up at a cabin where Toronto is supposed to meet his target. The thugs in the house bring Teddy to the basement, under the impression that he is the Man From Toronto. As Teddy realizes he has gotten himself into trouble, he attempts to calm their hostage, but the man is terrified and ends up giving the thugs the information they want. Moments later, a flash grenade is dropped into the basement, and FBI agents storm the house, apprehending all the men, including Teddy.Teddy is interrogated by two agents, who acknowledge that he is most definitely not The Man From Toronto, but the agents need ""The Man From Toronto"" to help them apprehend former Venezuelan Colonel Sebastian Marin (Alejandro De Hoyos). He attempted to stage a coup the previous year to overthrow the government but was stopped by U.S. Intelligence. Marin and his wife Daniela (Lela Loren) managed to escape before they could be arrested. They want Teddy to continue to pretend to be the Man From Toronto in order to get close to Marin and bring him down. The agents assign Agent Santoro (Jencarlos Caneda) to look after Lori while Teddy is on the job, but he feels threatened because Santoro is suave and handsome. Teddy has to tell Lori that his absence is because he was called to a work conference since he didn't tell her he got fired. Santoro escorts her while she spends time with her friend Annie (Kaley Cuoco).Toronto finds out about the mix-up and is given Teddy's information by The Handler. He finds Teddy's fitness ads and cannot believe that this is the man mistaken to be him. He tracks Teddy down as the agents bring him to meet with Daniela. Instead of meeting Marin, Daniela has her men take Teddy with them to a hangar. Toronto forces one of the agents at gunpoint to follow them.Teddy ends up on a plane heading to Puerto Rico.

The Handler contacts Toronto and chastises him for not killing Teddy since they do not leave witnesses alive.

He gets a call from The Handler and offers him a contract to take care of the mess with Toronto. Miami agrees and then uses his golf club as a rifle to kill the other golfer who witnessed the scene.Toronto brings Teddy to a tech convention where they will find Mr Green. He coaches Teddy on how to convincingly pretend to be him so they can find Green. Teddy is brought into a room with one of Marin's men while Toronto talks to him via an earpiece. Four captive men are presented, and Teddy has to interrogate them all to figure out which one is Mr Green. He is given knives as a torture method to get them to talk, but he accidentally slashes one of the men's under his eye, causing it to bleed. Despite Teddy trying to hold back, he pukes on two of the men, and one of them ends up saying that he is Green. However, the main thug notices Teddy's earpiece and prepares to kill him, forcing Toronto to step in and kill the goons. He then cuts the thumb off Mr Green and puts it in a bag.As the two try to make their way out of the building, Miami finds them and starts to go after them. He throws Teddy off the ledge, but he catches onto a decoration. Toronto and Miami fight as Teddy attempts to get himself down. Miami almost gets the thumb, but Teddy falls on top of him, and Toronto knocks him out. Toronto then contacts The Handler for an update on the situation. After hearing the conversation, Teddy believes that The Handler is lying to Toronto.Teddy and Toronto head on a flight to Washington DC, where Toronto tells Teddy he knows that he is a screw-up just based on what he learned from him in person and by going through his video history of making his failed gym ads. When they arrive, Teddy contacts Lori, and they make plans to meet at a fancy restaurant, which the FBI is alerted to. Teddy brings Toronto along and starts to coach him on social skills. The two meet Lori, who also invited Annie. Toronto hits it off with Annie, but they have to cut it short when Teddy spots Miami arriving at the restaurant. Miami catches up to them in a closet, where Toronto fights him again and gets shot in the leg, and Miami takes the thumb. Teddy and Toronto keep moving and steal a cop car to catch up to Miami since he and The Handler are going to meet with Marin.On the way to Marin's hotel room, Teddy asks Toronto about a job in Minnesota that keeps being brought up. Toronto explains that he was supposed to kill a man who owed gambling debts to the wrong people, but he stopped himself when he saw the man's kid. Toronto later regretted it because the man went on to commit a rampage. He says that when he finishes this job, he wants to open up his own restaurant and not kill anymore.At the hotel, Marin and Daniela meet with The Handler and Miami. They find that the thumb that Miami stole to set off a bomb that will kill the Venezuelan president doesn't work, as Mr Green was actually the main thug that did the interrogation. Teddy shows up and poses as Toronto, even though The Handler tries to convince Marin that it's not him. The FBI show up and arrest Marin and Daniela, but The Handler and Miami escape. Toronto ends up taking the payment that The Handler would have collected.Teddy rushes back home to try and find Lori, but he only finds the house empty. She left him a message saying that she is going to her mother's house because she doesn't know what is going on with Teddy.

They have to be intercepted within 12 mins of their launch, after which they cannot be defeated).
The second site is a remote platform in the middle of the ocean. Captain Collins (Elsa Pataky) is recently reassigned to the latter of the two interceptor missile launch sites. Following the conclusion of a high profile case where she reported sexual misconduct by one of her superiors, she experienced hazing and bullying by her peers in the military as revenge, hence her new deployment to this remote station.Under the command of Lt. Colonel Marshall (Rhys Muldoon), and working alongside Beaver (Aaron Glenane) and Shah (Mayen Mehta) (who only joined 6 months ago) in the station's command center, Collins finds herself as part of the last line of defense after the hostile takeover of Fort Greely.
The station is infiltrated by a small group of operatives led by Alex Kessel (Luke Bracey), who promptly kill Marshall and the other occupants of the base, leaving only Collins, Shah, and an unconscious Beaver, who was grazed by a stray bullet, as the survivors, holed up in the command center. The infiltrators attempt to negotiate entry into the command center, by which they can disarm the interceptor system and leave the continental US open to nuclear attack from the sixteen stolen warheads. They are rebuffed however, and attempt to forcibly enter instead with blowtorches. The doors will hold for 30-60 mins..Collins gets a call from general Dyson (Marcus Johnson) who says that a seal team is inbound in 90 mins. The President orders Collins to hold the command center, because the second SBX-1 falls, the terrorists will launch their nukes. Alex tries to bribe Collins with $ 30 MM, but she refuses to budge. Alex executes all surviving personnel in front of Collins, but she wont open the doors to the command center.
An operative (Tim Wong) launches a surprise attack after entering via a floor hatch, but is defeated and killed by Collins and Shah. Beaver regains consciousness and reveals himself to be an inside man for the infiltrators and motivated by a big pay day, holding both Collins and Shah at gunpoint while allowing Kessel and the remaining operatives to enter and assume control.Kessel hijacks a live feed of the Emergency Broadcast System and streams his manifesto online, naming the sixteen American cities to be destroyed, and communicating with the terrorist faction to launch the nukes immediately. On Alex's orders, one missile is launched.
Collins breaks free of her restraints and locks Kessel, Beaver, and a henchman back out of the command center, while defeating and killing Kira (Ingrid Kleinig), the lone operative still in the room. Collins then fires the interceptors in time to shoot down the incoming nuke missile. Kessel kills Collins father, but she still refuses to open the doors.Kessel turns to plan B, initiating the station's scuttling protocol, hoping to sink the station if he can't take control of it. As the station begins to sink, Shah volunteers to drop through the floor hatch to the ocean below and manually re-engage the station's hatches, in order to slow down the station's collapse, such that the interceptors are still able to destroy the warheads when they eventually pass through the airspace overhead. Shah succeeds, but is killed by Beaver.
The rig will sink in 15 mins and the seals are still 17 mins out. Collins learns that Kessel is being paid to do this and a Russian submarine is approaching the rig to carry Kessel off.Collins decides to make a play, hiding and letting Kessel, Beaver, and the remaining henchman take over and disable the seemingly empty command center. Kessel orders the remaining 15 nukes to be launched at America.
Her ruse works, with Beaver going to check up on the station's roof to find and eliminate her. Collins is able to stealthily dispatch the remaining henchman while Kessel flees the room. Grabbing a laptop, Collins ascends to the roof and plugs the device in, hoping to manually launch the interceptor missiles using this method. She is found by Beaver however, and the two engage in hand to hand combat, with Collins emerging victorious after using razor wire to decapitate Beaver.
Kessel, who had called in a Russian submarine to pick up the team of operatives earlier, finds Collins just as she successfully launches the interceptor missiles with a fraction of a second left before the nukes would have crossed the point of interception. His plan failed, he engages in combat with Collins, who manages to defeat and subdue him, just as the Russian submarine ascends from the sea. A pair of Russians emerge from the submarine tower, but rather than shooting Collins, terminate Kessel instead, before departing.Collins later recovers from her ordeal in the hospital, and is personally given a promotion by the US president (Zoe Carides) for her efforts. She learns that her dad is still alive.",One Army captain must use her years of tactical training and military expertise when a simultaneous coordinated attack threatens the remote missile interceptor station she is in command of.

Five years later, a teenage Craig and elderly Harrigan have become friends.During this time, Craig starts high school and becomes close to Ms. Hart, a teacher who comes to his aid when Kenny Yankovich, a school bully, attempts to intimidate him. After winning $3,000 from a lottery ticket that Harrigan gave him and receiving his first iPhone for Christmas, Craig buys Harrigan one too. Despite initial resistance to new technology, he greatly enjoys the phone.The elderly Harrigan dies, leaving Craig heartbroken at the loss of his friend. At the funeral, Craig sneaks Harrigan's phone into the coffin. He is then informed by Harrigan's associate that he was left a bequest in Harrigan's will. Craig will receive $800,000 in a trust fund, to support his future studies and pursuit of a writing career, which he had told Harrigan about.Craig calls Harrigan's phone as a gesture of thanks. The next morning, he discovers that Harrigan sent him an odd text message, though his father chalks it up to being a bug within the iPhone itself.Life goes on for Craig, who goes to a dance with his crush, only to be attacked by Kenny, who accuses him of ratting out his drug-dealing activities on school grounds, getting him expelled. Later that night, Craig calls Harrigan's phone in a fit of frustration and sadness; he tells him what Kenny did and he is ""afraid that this won't end, and I wish that you were here just to give me some advice.""Kenny is found dead the next day, having apparently fallen from his bedroom window while attempting to sneak out. Scared by what happened, Craig goes to an Apple store, upgrades his phone to a newer model, and puts away his old one.Craig eventually graduates from high school and departs for college in Boston, to study journalism. While there, his father calls to tell him Ms. Hart was killed in a car accident involving a drunk driver, leaving her fiancé hospitalized. The driver, Dean Whitmore, is sent to rehab instead of prison for the accident although he'd been caught for drunk driving on other occasions, his license was suspended and he had an open container.Infuriated by the verdict, Craig returns to his room and uses his old phone to call Harrigan, explicitly wishing death on Whitmore. Craig later learns Whitmore was found dead in his shower. He drives to the rehab center and bribes a worker there to give him details about the suicide. He is told that Whitmore swallowed shampoo and a piece of broken soap bar. Craig is disturbed to learn that the soap is the same brand used by Ms. Hart, and Whitmore's suicide note is actually a lyric from the song ""Stand by Your Man"" by Tammy Wynette; Harrigan's ringtone.Craig breaks down and returns to his hometown. While there, he remembers opening Harrigan's ""secret closet"" (which he had refused to let Craig enter) after he passed, that it was actually a shrine to his deceased mother, so visits his gravestone, apologizing for his messages. He theorizes that Harrigan's odd text messages to him are his way of begging Craig to let his spirit rest in peace and for him to move forward in the here and now.As he leaves Harrigan's grave, Craig visits his own mother's and collapses in tears, begging for forgiveness. He then rushes to the town quarry, contemplating the water while standing very near the edge before throwing his phone into the water. As Craig walks away, he quietly narrates that when he himself passes on and is buried, he wants his pockets to be empty.

This isn't Christmas Carol, it's a movie about the ability to stay redeemed long term. And doing it everyday, and then doing it again even if you fail occasionally. It's about the consequences of the choices we make and being aware of those before we hit ""send"". And it's a fun musical. All the haters out there, like movie critics, will wake up tomorrow and still be awful because some people really are unredeemable. I mean it, movie critics on this site really are unredeemable. Merry Christmas?
The movie starts with the Christnas Carol theme. BUT this version is about the spirit of Christmas Present, CP. Christmas Present, CP, wants a challenge, a chance to impact a life where a change will make real differences, big ripples in kindness. The ""office"" wants him to consider retirement and get a life.
Christmas Present finds his target, in the reprehensible character, played by Ryan Reynolds, Clint Briggs. Clint's firm makes its wealth by creating negative attack adds and running offensive click bait on social media. But Clint's real theme is his belief that people never really change. Christmas Present wants to prove Clint wrong. But not to save Clint. Turns out Christmas Present (spoiler alert) is the original unredeemable Scrooge himself, who, it turns out died just three weeks after being redeemed. Christmas Present is hiding a fear, that he isn't really changed.
While leading Clint thru the spirits, Christmas Present falls for a Clint employee, a truly wonderful women, Kimberly, who hates the she has become helping Clint get rich and climbing the corporate ladder. She hits all time low by doing opposition research on a child to help Clint's niece win class President.The series of events past, present and future unfold for Clint, interrupted by Clint avoidance, and CPs self-awareness. All this filled with song and dance as back stage heaven actors make the flash backs work.
Not unexpectedly people do change. CP decides to try retirement. CP doesn't think he has changed, not really, but he has a friend now in CP. There is great songs, great fun, a nice twist on human doubt and failure and the idea that redemption doesn't happen over night. It's a tear jerker, yes a dieing sister, but lots of human weakness and a slam at HR. Enjoy.",A musical version of Charles Dickens's story of a miserly misanthrope who is taken on a magical journey.

Two young people lie on the road, the girl barely moving, the boy, motionless. Tessa wakes up in the hospital.In a flashback set 182 days before, Tessa spends the morning taking photos in the coastal town, wandering into the local theater to watch a classic French film. Skylar, the other person at the movie, offers to translate. He is a true romantic, he and Tessa have very different views.In a flashback set 102 days before, Tessa is encouraged to apply to the RISD for her photography skills. Later, while shooting a rowing meet, she finally finds Skylar again. They both obviously had been searching for each other. They spend the day together, and she shows him the world through her eyes. At the Empyrean, an abandoned honeymooners hotel he teaches her to waltz and they kiss. He tells her he'll be back at the end of the month to stay for the summer.In the present, Tessa is back at school, and is reminded of the RISD deadline. Later, going home, she throws out her developing materials. Her adoptive dad reminds her that her mother never stuck to anything. Dreaming of Skylar, she wakes up to see her Robert Doisneau print of Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville. Flashback: July 4. After the fireworks, she shows him her darkroom, portfolio and opens up about her mother flaking out, forcing her into the foster care system. They go out on a boat during the day, he shows her how to row, he declares his love and they make love on the shore.Tessa tells her friend Shannon about The In Between, the concept of a window of time in which someone recently deceased needs to have a final contact before moving on. Sitting the SAT, weirdly Skylar moves her hand on her answer sheet to draw what seems to be a non-sensical scribble. Then their song, 'Never tear us apart' comes up simultaneously on everyone's silenced mobiles.Flashback: 11 days before the accident. Skylar angers Tessa when he puts a photo she gifted him in a photo exhibit to show her talent. Her inability to express her feelings comes up. He wants her to realize they could have a future and she continues to hold back. Photographing her adoptive mother, she's advised to try to admit her feelings out loud.Shannon helps Tessa try to channel Skylar after reading several books. First they try with a planchette, scrying, and instrumental trans-communication Electronic voice phenomenon which, unbeknownst to them, works on the TV. Getting in her adoptive mother's car, the built-in GPS shows her the same route she had scribbled on her SAT sheet. So, she blows off returning the car, following the route, arriving to the In Between author Doris she met in the hospital. She suggests Tessa seek him where they had their strongest moments. Flashback: 5 days before the accident. Tessa discovers Skylar has decided to go to Oregon to support his father for the year, leaving her on the East coast. She takes it as a sign, as she finally has applied to RISD and was about to express her love, and she breaks it off.After buying special photography equipment, Shannon drives Tessa to the places she and Skylar had most closely connected, hoping to catch his image/connect. Finally they do connect at The Empyrean, but not completely, and he shatters a mirror trying to reach her. The police catch up with her there, traced through her mobile. At home, her adoptive parents are on top of her, she collapses, and in the hospital she's told her heart needs to be repaired the next day. Shannon sneaks her out, with Skylar's help (he manipulates some electronics, distracting the nurses), who then guides them to the site of the accident.In a flashback to the night of the accident, Shannon convinces Tessa to catch Skylar before he leaves. The timelines overlap. As paramedics attend Tessa's collapsed body, reunited with Skylar briefly, they are in Paris, in black and white, and mimic the Doisneau print Le baiser... They are back at a house on the beach, and she hears from far off her adoptive mom calling her back. Tearfully, she reminds him that 'love never dies', deciding to go back to live.In a mid-credits scene, Tessa and Skylar are wandering around the beach drawing stick figures on sand","After surviving a car accident that took the life of her boyfriend, a teenage girl believes he's attempting to reconnect with her from the after world."

Prior to the start of the film, one of Shawn's videos resulted in a serious controversy that lost him his sponsors and much of his fanbase. Desperate to regain his popularity and retain his new sole sponsor, Shawn plans to livestream himself spending the night in Death Manor, a purportedly haunted house where several people have died.As part of the deal with the sponsor, if Shawn leaves or doesn't fully explore the house, he forfeits the sponsorship. Throughout the stream Shawn periodically opens the chat screen to react to his viewers' comments. As the livestream begins, Shawn throws his car's sparkplugs into the woods, then locks the door behind him and throws the key down a grate. While setting up his cameras, he narrates Death Manor's history: It is haunted by the ghost of Mildred Pratt, a wealthy Mormon heiress and failed poet, who died by suicide after her publisher and paramour's sudden death. Subsequent occupants of the house died mysteriously and the place was eventually abandoned. Shawn speculates that the various deaths over the years were Mildred trying to build a family she was unable to have in life. Shawn tours the house and introduces each room, including one with no history of paranormal activity. He declares it the safe room and sets up his equipment there. He discovers a strange symbol hanging in a closet, removes it and later destroys it in a panic.Afterwards, Shawn attempts to provoke the spirits via a séance. After experiencing some strange noises, he fearfully shuts himself up in his room. It turns out to be Chrissy, a super fan who has traveled to Death Manor to meet him. Shawn, reluctant to share his spotlight, begrudgingly allows her stay to please his viewers. They investigate more of the house, finding Mildred's poetry book, which Shawn dismisses as mediocre as it ""doesn't even rhyme"". As the two attempt to speak to the spirit of Mildred through a spirit board, Chrissy convinces Shawn to recite a Latin phase to put the ghosts to rest.As Chrissy repeatedly tries to scare Shawn, he suddenly recalls that he locked the door to the Manor, meaning Chrissy had to have waited there for Shawn. He accuses her of being a stalker and tells her to leave. She attacks him, biting his neck. In self defense he stabs her in the neck. Believing he's killed her, Shawn intends to leave and turn himself in, but finds her body gone. Shawn searches the grate he had thrown his key down, but only finds the key to a box containing a severed finger and a picture revealing that Chrissy is actually Mildred Pratt. Knowledgeable viewers discover that the symbol he destroyed earlier was a hamsa meant to protect against evil. Also, the Latin phrase he recited was a soul offering that Mildred had used to bind the souls of the previous occupants to herself. After being terrorized by the grotesque ghouls of the previous occupants, Shawn makes several attempts to flee the house and eventually jumps out the second floor window.Shawn finds the spark plugs, but comes across more ghouls. After fighting one off with a potato gun, his iPad is damaged. Cut off from his viewers and resigned to his fate, Shawn takes shelter in his car and reads from Mildred's book of poetry. He discovers the incantation that Mildred used to gain her satanic powers, and the phrase repeated by the ghostly voices is actually in one of the poems. Putting the pieces together, he realizes Mildred never wanted a family, but an audience for her poetry. He becomes inspired to complete the ritual to circumvent her power through his own audience and send her back to hell.Shawn arms himself, returns to the house to challenge Mildred. Fighting his way back to the saferoom, he retrieves a spare iPad and reads the comments that translate the incantation. While setting up the ritual, Shawn awkwardly apologizes for his insensitive stunts, racism, and poor apology, vowing to be better.After a grueling fight with Mildred, Shawn gets the upper hand and reads the incantation, which didn't work. Spotting her severed finger, he remembers the ritual requires a ""sacrifice of flesh"". He cuts off one of his fingers, which completes the ritual, with Mildred being dragged into a blood-filled basement by an unseen force. Shawn celebrates, thanking his now massive viewer count for helping him survive the night. However, as he exits, he is surrounded by Mildred's surviving ghoul audience and his livestream cuts out.

Natalie is an artist and has ambitions to make her own movie one day. The next day, Natalie feels sick, and her best friend Cara (Aisha Dee) gets her a pregnancy test. When Natalie takes the test, her life diverges into two parallel realities based on the result.In the reality where Natalie's test is positive, she moves back home with her mom Tina (Andrea Savage) and dad Rick (Luke Wilson), who are less than thrilled, especially when Gabe proposes to her prematurely. Natalie starts getting bored with her life at home. After her daughter is born, her life is even more tied up in just taking care of the kid and with no identity of her own. Her parents encourage Natalie to still pursue her career in animation while she struggles with the realization that she is becoming a mother.In the reality where Natalie's test is negative, she moves to Los Angeles with Cara, and they look to start building their careers. Natalie applies to be an assistant to animator Lucy Galloway (Nia Long). After pining for the job (she attends a party given by Lucy, where she was not invited, just to get Lucy's attention. But she finds that Lucy doesn't even attend these events), she gets an offer, and forms a strong bond with her colleague Jake (David Corenswet). They encourage each other to follow their dreams, with Jake desiring to be a successful producer.In the reality where Natalie is pregnant, she and Gabe struggle to co-parent as their daughter Rosie is born. Gabe wants Natalie to move in with him, but Natalie does not reciprocate feelings and tells him to date. Gabe meets a woman named Miranda, who Natalie exhibits jealous feelings towards. When Natalie goes on a trip to Los Angeles to visit Cara and her girlfriend, she gets a call from Rosie who says she is left overnight with Miranda's sister. On that trip Natalie runs into Jake. Natalie doesn't trust Gabe and later finds out he proposed to Miranda. Natalie throws herself into her career as a therapeutic tool to get over Gabe.In the other reality, Natalie and Jake develop a strong romantic relationship (They start dating and have regular sex) and consider moving in together. That is, until Jake receives a year-long job producing in Nova Scotia. They try long distance, but Natalie finds it isn't working for her as Jake is always busy with work. Natalie shows Lucy her portfolio, and Lucy gives her some very critical notes, saying her work is unoriginal. She encourages Natalie to quit to pursue other avenues of creativity (& finds her own voice, instead of helping others find theirs), and Natalie does so. She returns home to a friend's baby shower with Cara to find that her life is in a downward spiral in comparison to her friends.In both realities, Natalie moves toward a career breakthrough. She gets accepted to the South by Southwest film festival where in one reality, she sits on a panel of creators including Lucy, and in another, has a short film of hers showcased. In one reality, Natalie visits Gabe's band in a bar to catch up with him after five years. Later on, she is surprised when Jake has traveled a long way to see her short film, despite the implication that he was fired from the movie. Lucy sees Natalie's work and encourages her to stop by her office for a talk when she returns to Los Angeles. In the other, Natalie and Rosie watch Gabe's band perform at a bar. Afterwards, Natalie asks Gabe why Miranda isn't here to see him play. Gabe tells her that he broke off the engagement because he is in love with her, not Miranda.In one reality, Jake and Natalie walk the streets together, happy to be reunited. In the other, Gabe and Natalie have a serious conversation about how they would like to develop a romantic relationship for the sake of their daughter and because of their romantic feelings for each other. Both realities converge when each of the couples walk past Natalie's sorority house, where she took the pregnancy test.In both realities, Natalie walks up to the bathroom, and looks in the mirror, and reassures herself that she is okay.","On the eve of her college graduation, Natalie's life diverges into parallel realities: one in which she becomes pregnant and remains in her hometown to raise her child and another in which she moves to LA to pursue her dream career."

Kimi is a smart speaker which controversially makes use of human monitoring to improve the device's search algorithm. Amygdala plans to soon hold an initial public offering, which stands to earn Hasling a fortune.Angela Childs is an employee of Amygdala in Seattle who works from home monitoring incoming data streams from Kimi devices and making corrections to the software. She suffers from anxiety and agoraphobia because of a previous assault, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Her primary human contact is with her romantic partner Terry, her neighbour from across the street, whom she meets for sex in her apartment. One day while working, Angela receives a recording that appears to capture a violent sexual assault by a man named Brad. With the help of her coworker Darius, she accesses the information of the account holder, a woman named Samantha. Angela uncovers more of Samantha's recording, including one that sounds like her murder. It is revealed that 'Brad' is, in fact, Bradley Hasling himself and that Samantha was his mistress. Bradley had ordered the murder from a hitman named Rivas. Angela transfers the recordings to a flash drive.She reports the incident to her superior, who refers her to Natalie Chowdhury, an executive at Amygdala. Angela attempts to reach Chowdhury over the phone but is eventually convinced to come to her office in person, with the promise that the FBI will be informed about the case. At the office, Angela is disturbed when Chowdhury seems reticent to contact the authorities and refers to her prior mental health leave. While waiting for the FBI to be contacted, she receives word from Darius that someone has deleted Samantha's voice recordings from the Amygdala servers, and shortly after sees two unknown men enter the office. She flees and travels on foot towards the nearby FBI field office while being tracked by Rivas and his accomplices through her cell phone.The men catch up with Angela and attempt to force her into a van, but a group of nearby protestors prevents her from being abducted. However, one of Rivas's men, a hacker named Yuri, can deduce where she is headed from her search history. Angela is drugged and taken back to her apartment by her kidnappers, who plan to stage a home invasion to cover up her murder. On their way inside, they are interrupted by Kevin, a neighbour who also spends all of his time inside and became concerned after seeing Angela leave the house. Kevin is stabbed, distracting the assailants, but Rivas is already waiting inside her apartment. He confiscates the flash drive and deletes the recordings from Angela's laptop, but she uses her Kimi device to again distract Rivas and his men, escaping to a higher floor.

Headquarters suspects there was a leak from the Vienna station, where Henry and Vick work. Henry is sent to interview Celia Harrison, who also worked at the Vienna station at the time of the hijacking. Henry and Celia were lovers, but she left him shortly after the event.Celia, now retired, lives in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California with her family. Henry meets her at an upscale restaurant, which is almost empty of customers and staff. As Henry and Celia talk, she reveals that an Austrian intelligence agent named Karl Stein approached her shortly after she moved to Carmel. He wanted her to inform on her coworkers, but she refused. Henry has Celia recall the events of the hijacking.In a flashback to 2012, Flight 127 is on the runway when it is hijacked by four armed militants belonging to an Islamic terrorist group. The Vienna station jumps into action to address the crisis and learns that Ilyas Shushani, a Chechen and former informant for Henry, may be involved. The hijackers threaten to kill the passengers unless several of their comrades are released from custody. Ahmed, a CIA courier who happened to be on the plane, contacts the CIA and suggests an attack via the plane's undercarriage. Celia connects with a possible source named Mohammed, but the meeting seems to yield nothing of value. Henry tells Celia and her mentor, Bill Compton, that when Henry worked in Moscow his superiors forced him to betray Ilyas to the Russian government as a trade-off for intel on an imminent attack on a U.S. embassy.The Vienna station receives another message from Ahmed saying that the terrorists have a camera mounted on the plane's undercarriage and the assault should be called off. Celia notices differences in the language of Ahmed's messages and fears he has been compromised. Checking the station's phone logs, she notices that a call to Iran was placed from Bill's office phone. Then Ahmed is killed and thrown off the plane. The next day, Celia leaves both Henry and Vienna.In the present, Henry asks why she ended their relationship so abruptly. Celia reveals that she saw a call on Henry's cellphone from the same Iranian number that she had found in the station phone logs. It is revealed that when the terrorists' demands were not met, they released sarin gas, killing themselves, the crew, and all passengers. The Vienna station is devastated by the outcome. Realizing that Henry was the leak, she left him but did not divulge her discovery to the CIA.She further confesses that, after Henry contacted her to arrange this meeting, she contacted Karl Stein, and he arranged the meeting place, the staff, and fake customers, with the aim of poisoning Henry via his wine.As Henry begins to succumb to the poison, Celia tearfully asks why he betrayed everyone to the terrorists. He explains that he was lured into a meeting with Ilyas, who had become radicalized and masterminded the hijacking. Ilyas' people staged the meeting between Mohammed and Celia to create the impression that Celia's life was in danger. This pushed Henry into revealing the plan for an undercarriage assault, and then the presence of Ahmed on the plane, in exchange for her life.Henry comes to terms with his impending death, and Celia returns home to her husband and children. Karl calls Vick to report that Henry has died, revealing that they had been working together the entire time.

He finds a bunch of unanswered texts and calls from his gay best friend group, as they are set to take off for their annual holiday summer weekend to Fire Island located off Long Island, New York. Noah makes it to a boat where he joins his ""sisters"" - Keegan (Tomas Matos), Luke (Matt Rogers), Max (Torian Miller), and Howie (Bowen Yang), who has the closest bond with Noah.The guys arrive at the island where they meet with their mother figure, Erin (Margaret Cho), whose house they stay at all the time. After unpacking, Noah and Howie drink beers and share a joint as they talk about where they are now in life, and how Howie hasn't been around since getting a better job in New York City. The guys make it their goal to get laid while they are there which they dub Fire Island as the 'Gay Disneyland'. Not long after, Max accidentally shoves Noah and causes him to drop his phone in the swimming pool. After putting it in rice, Erin admits to the guys that she is broke and that this will be the last year that they can spend the summer at that house, but they all are determined to make the most out of this holiday.The group goes out to dancing with other island visitors. Howie is checked out by a doctor named Charlie (James Scully), while Noah's attention is caught by a lawyer named Will (Conrad Ricamora). Before Noah can talk to Will, another guy tries hitting on Noah, prompting Will to walk away. Charlie and his friends start to leave, so Howie's friends push him (literally) to stage a meet-cute. It works, and Charlie chats up Howie as they and their friends watch the sunset. While Charlie and Howie get along, Noah puts his foot in his mouth when he makes a comment about lawyers and finds out Will is one. Charlie then invites the guys to a party at the house he and his friends are staying at later that night.The group shows up for the party, where they are surprised at how big the house is. They also stand out as seeming like the ""trashiest"" bunch compared to the wealthier crowd at the party. Charlie's snooty friend Braden (Aidan Wharton) ""greets"" them, but Charlie comes to be more hospitable to the guys. Howie talks to Charlie, but Charlie later notes to Will that Howie hasn't asked Charlie what his interests are. Noah overhears the conversation since he was using their bathroom, and he hears Will refer to him as ""annoying"". The guys have to leave after Keegan and Luke get too drunk and rowdy, and Luke vomits into an urn in front of everyone.The next morning, Noah notices Howie stayed at Charlie and Will's house, thinking he might have hooked up with Charlie. He goes over to the house and just finds Howie passed out in the bathtub because he was very drunk. Noah and Howie then invite Charlie and his friends to their house later that night for dinner. Despite Erin not being thrilled about having to cook and entertain guests, she sends the guys out for groceries. There, they meet a guy named Dex (Zane Phillips), who hits it off with Noah and his friends. When they find out that Will knows Dex, Noah invites Dex to the house as well.During the dinner party, Noah and Will continue to act confrontational and belligerent toward each other. Noah and Dex talk about how Will thinks he's better than most people because he comes from money, and he also looks down on Dex for making an OnlyFans page. Noah and Dex start to kiss before they are interrupted. When everyone is gathered for dinner, Charlie tells the guys that they are unlike anyone he has met before.Howie spends more time with Charlie and they eventually kiss. The guys do drugs (snorting cocaine and drinking scotch) and later go to an underwear party, where Noah is told by Charlie's friend Cooper (Nick Adams) that Charlie brought Will along so that they could hook up, seemingly to get in Noah's head due to an obvious attraction between him and Will. Noah finds Dex, and they go to hook up, but just as Noah starts to go down on Dex, he sees Will in the corner looking uncomfortable. Noah jumps up too fast and accidentally slams his head into Dex's nose, causing it to bleed. As Dex goes to the bathroom, Will pulls Noah aside and tells him that Dex is not who he pretends to be. The guys also spot Charlie kissing his ex, Chad (Jonathon Timpanelli), whom Cooper says was flown in for Charlie. This leaves Howie feeling depressed.Noah's friends end up leaving on a water taxi to go to another party, leaving him to walk home alone with Will as it starts raining. They continue arguing over Noah's perception of Will as being a snob, leading to Noah falling into the mud. Will helps him up and nearly kisses Noah, but he pulls back from Will because he thinks they don't like each other. Will explains that part of his behavior comes from the fact that he thinks people take advantage of Charlie's kindness and Will doesn't want to see him get hurt. Noah manages to find Howie, but they just end up getting into an argument because Howie isn't enjoying the trip the way that Noah thought he would. Noah goes back to the house and feels like he messed up.Noah is woken up the next day by Erin, Keegan, and Max, as they deliver him a letter written and left by Will. He explains himself further and apologizes for the impression he gave off, and says that Dex hurt someone close to Will, which is why he doesn't trust him and was warning Noah about him. After he reads the letter, he sees Charlie has come over to talk to Howie. Charlie leaves, and Howie throws himself into the pool. He explains to the group that Charlie was told that Chad has Lyme disease and he wants to be there for Chad, so he will be leaving the island sooner than expected.Noah goes to a drag bar where he runs into Will. He shows Noah Dex's Instagram profile, showing that he posts a lot of sexy pics with activism tags (""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Stop Asian Hate"") to get attention. Noah and Will talk more, and Will ends up getting on the stage to dance. The two continue to hang out into the morning.Later on, the group goes to another spot where Howie does karaoke. Things take a downward turn when Erin receives a video of Luke having sex with Dex being posted online. Noah prepares to confront Dex but gets help from Will, who uses his lawyer skills to convince Dex that he will serve jail time if he doesn't remove the video since it was posted without Luke's consent. Dex agrees. Noah is impressed and walks along the beach with Will. The spark between them becomes clearer.The next day, Howie tells Noah he is leaving because, despite his denial, he cannot get over seeing Charlie with Chad. Noah runs to Charlie's house to tell him what the deal is, as Charlie acknowledges that he and Howie like each other the same way. With the help of Noah's friends, the group hijacks a water taxi to catch up to Howie since his boat already left. Charlie manages to catch up to him and express his feelings to Howie, leading them to kiss again.In the final scene, the group goes to watch the sunset again. Noah and Will dance together and finally kiss. The friends run over to cheer them on.","A group of queer best friends gather in Fire Island Pines for their annual week of love and laughter, but a sudden change of events might make this their last summer in gay paradise."

In the struggle, the creature accidentally pushes Cindy's mother against a nail that pierces her neck, killing her. Before the creature escapes, Cindy calls him a ""monster"".Twenty years later, Cindy returns to Newville for closure and to spend Christmas with her father, Lou. She bonds with police officer Burke Goldman and reunites with Newville's sheriff Peter Hooper, who continues to dismiss Cindy's claim of her mother's murderer being a monster due to lack of evidence. He reveals that Newville stopped selling or putting up Christmas decorations after the incident. That night, Lou finds old Christmas decorations and puts them up with Cindy. While she is taking out the trash, the creature locks her out and kills Lou before stealing their decorations.While at the hospital, Cindy meets Newville's mayor Margie McBean, who is uncomfortable with Cindy's claims of the creature, believing it will cause panic. After her father's funeral, Cindy finds a rare flower in her home and traces it to a mountain via a website. Cindy finds the wallet of a missing person and sees the creature killing a couple before retreating. Shortly after, Hooper tells Cindy he cannot investigate as the mountain is in federal territory, although Burke agrees to help. Meanwhile, the creature slaughters a group of Santa cosplayers in a local bar.As the creature attempts to break into Cindy's home, he is scared off by a man known as Doc Zeuss, who believes Cindy's story since his wife was murdered by the creature years ago. Burke goes to the mountain and finds the creature's hideout with several wallets of missing people. Cindy trains and prepares to kill the creature, who rampages through Newville and kills several residents. Burke discourages Cindy from facing the creature and finds out the wallets all belonged to tourists who were lured to the mountain by the same website Cindy saw, which is owned by Mayor McBean. He confronts Hooper, who confirms the creature's existence and explains that after Cindy's mother's death, the creature returned every Christmas to slaughter more people, and later his hideout was found. Hooper and Mayor McBean collaborated to make the website and send unsuspecting tourists to sacrifices in order to stop the creature's killing spree in addition to removing all Christmas decorations from the town.Mayor McBean attempts to leave the town, but the creature kills her on the way. Burke heads to the mountain to kill the creature but becomes injured and is rescued by Cindy, Hooper, and Doc. Hooper goes after the creature but is killed. Cindy retreats to her decorated home and waits for the creature. When the creature arrives, she ambushes and engages him in a fight. Cindy finally incapacitates the creature, but before she can kill him, Cindy sees that he is still wearing the necklace she gave him twenty years ago. Cindy realizes her mother's death was unintentional, and the creature never wanted to hurt anyone; his murderous behavior sparked when she called him a ""monster"", so she forgives him and kisses the creature on the cheek. This act of kindness causes the creature's heart to grow three sizes, which ends up exploding and kills him.Sometime after, Newville reverts to displaying Christmas ornaments, the creature is deemed an urban legend and causes the town to become a popular tourist destination; Cindy and Burke start a romantic relationship and the narrator hints that the creature may return next year as his growl is heard.","In a sleepy mountain town, Cindy's parents are murdered and her Christmas is stolen by a bloodthirsty green figure in a red Santa suit."

The meeting, held in a church, is cut short when the church pastor, uncomfortable with the topic of the group, threatens Emily into leaving. To save face, Emily decides to invite the others to her home; Leslie, Kim, and Marjorie accept.The four travel to Kim's store for food and drink. While Emily is selecting wine, Asian-American sisters Anne and Lily arrive. Unaware that the shop was closed, they attempt to purchase wine, but are refused service by Kim. Lily confronts Kim refusing service, causing Emily to intervene. Anne attempts to defuse the situation, only to be intimidated by Emily into purchasing the most expensive item available.

She had been abducted by an Army deserter and was now being held for ransom. A soldier guide for the bounty hunter was appointed by the Army. As it turns out the guide is a fellow soldier and friend of the Army deserter. He had also claimed to know the possible whereabouts of the woman and her captors. After trekking into Mexico, they encounter another of the antagonists who happens to be a powerful land owner and a kind of warlord. After a stale mate standoff that resulted in a retreat by the villain, the two continued on to the place where the abducted woman was possibly being held.

Argentina had been under military rule for 7 years before that. President Raúl Alfonsín orders a trial against all former commanders for crimes against humanity.
Public prosecutor Julio César Strassera (Ricardo Darín) is chosen to make the government's case against the military junta for alleged crimes against humanity after the military courts declined to press charges.
Julio lives with his wife Silvia (Alejandra Flechner) daughter Veronica (Gina Mastronicola) and son Javier (Santiago Armas).
Susana (Paula Ransenberg) is Strassera's secretary. Julio knows that he is being arm twisted into taking the case, and he has no hope that the military commanders would be brought to justice. Julio knows that this might be a trap and that his family might be in danger.Ruso (Norman Briski) is Julio's mentor and says that this will be the most important trial of Julio's career. Julio does not have the option to refuse the case.
The junta have retained the services of senior, experienced lawyers, while Strassera struggles to find lawyers to form his prosecution team. Strassera meets Luis Moreno Ocampo (Peter Lanzani), his assigned deputy prosecutor, but initially rejects his offer for help due to Ocampo's military family background.
Strassera receives several death threats and is assigned a security detail. Leech and Ramiro find out that the man dating Veronica is married but is not connected to the Junta.Finding no other lawyers, Strassera accepts Moreno Ocampo's help. Moreno Ocampo, a professor, suggests that they look for young law graduates and inexperienced lawyers, as senior lawyers are unwilling to risk their reputations or safety to sign on to a trial that is so divisive among the public.
Basile (Héctor Díaz) is one of the military junta's defense attorneys. Jorge Rafael Videla (Marcelo Pozzi), Orlando Ramón Agosti (Jorge Gregorio), Emilio Eduardo Massera (Joselo Bella), Jorge Isaac Anaya (Sergio Sánchez), Basilio Lami Dozo (Marcelo López), Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri (Carlos Ihler), Roberto Eduardo Viola (Héctor Balcone), and Armando Lambruschini (Jorge Varas)-the members of the military junta, are the defendants.Strassera and Moreno Ocampo interview and assemble a team, many of whom work in government offices and can use their access to materials to help the case. The team is assembled on 21st Oct 1984 and has till Feb 15th, to conduct their investigations and build their case. The hardest part is to provide proof that the commanders knew of the tortures and the kidnappings and were seen physically at the detention centers all over the country. Julio says that they will focus on proving that the atrocities were systematic and followed a pattern all over the country, which means it was coordinated from the top.
Because the atrocities were committed across the country, Strassera and his team seek victims and record their testimonies. Meanwhile, he and his team face risk to their safety. Moreno Ocampo's family turn on him for going against their military history.
On Feb 15th, 1985, 16 volumes with 4000 pages of evidence were submitted to the court in 709 cases with 800+ witnesses.On the first day of the trial on 22nd April 1985, the court receives a bomb threat, but Strassera convinces the judges that the trial must proceed. The trial is recorded by cameras and parts of it are broadcast around the world. Many victims of the junta testify about torture they endured or witnessed. Witnesses were repeatedly threatened, and Julio knew that there was nothing he could do to protect them. The court stopped issuing the daily list of witnesses, so the threats could stop.
Adriana Calvo (Laura Paredes), testifies that she gave birth while kidnapped by the military government during the dictatorship. She says that she was in a car while the birth took place, the soldiers did not allow her to hold the baby. They took her to a marble room, where they made her clean the floors, naked, before allowing her to hold her baby. This is the testimony that eventually changes Ocampo's mother's opinion about the Junta.
President Raúl Alfonsín invites Strassera to meet with him and informs him that he is keeping a close watch on the court events and was deeply moved by the testimony of the witnesses. Despite this, the Attorney General angers Strassera by intimating that he should be lenient with the Air Force. The Attorney General implies that Julio has to be careful while asking for sentences, as it is very easy for the Junta to take over the power again and shed blood.For his closing argument on Sep 18th 1985, Strassera realizes that he will have the chance to make his case not just to the judges in the courtroom, but to the people of Argentina and those around the world. With the help of his family, he composes an eloquent closing statement, ending: ""Your Honors: never again!"". The judges move into deliberations, and Strassera's team await the outcome.A dying friend Ruso asks Strassera for details of the final sentences. Strassera lies and tells him that all the generals received life sentences.
Shortly after, Strassera learns that the court is sentencing General Jorge Videla and Admiral Emilio Massera to life imprisonment, General Roberto Viola to seventeen years, Admiral Armando Lambruschini to eight years, and General Orlando Agosti to four and a half years. 3 commanders from the Air Force were acquitted. Dissatisfied with most of the outcomes, Strassera begins typewriting an appeal.
This was the first instance in history when a military dictatorship was tried in a civilian court.",A team of lawyers takes on the heads of Argentina's bloody military dictatorship during the 1980s in a battle against odds and a race against time.

Not far from them, U.S. Air Force Captain Sean Irons (Jesse Williams) drives by them, injured and in search of an artifact he has traced to that location. Jack finds him and tries to help him, and they discover a crashed aircraft in a nearby field. Emerging from the aircraft is a glowing orb that scans both men, choosing Jack as its guardian. The aircraft then self-destructs.From here on, Jack becomes a superhero called The Guard. While he is regarded as an amazing protector of the world, his duties have caused him to neglect his duties as a father, so he and Lily get divorced, and Charlie stays with his mother.Ten years later, Charlie (now played by Walker Scobell) is part of the baseball team with his best friend Barry Berger (Keith L. Williams). He has a crush on a girl named Maya (Momona Tamada), who used to go to school with him until she transferred out of the country, which Charlie believes is due to an incident he caused when they were kids, while Berger has a crush on another girl, Lizzie (Abby James Witherspoon). During the baseball game, Charlie goes up against a bully called Forrest Deal, AKA ""The Sequoia"". Forrest goes up to bat and swings the ball square into Charlie's stomach.Berger's brother Big Mac (Kezii Curtis) drives the boys home. Charlie is set to go to Jack's house for his birthday, but he has also felt a distance from his father due to his constant excuses for missing out on his life. However, Charlie is also a big fan of The Guard. Meanwhile, CEO Ansel Argon (Michael Pena) of Argon Tactical has been wanting to use the source of The Guard's power for his own sinister schemes.Lily drives Charlie to Jack's house, where he gives him a baseball mitt as a birthday gift...except it's for the wrong hand, as Charlie is a lefty. Jack makes a save with a Nintendo Switch, and the two spend the night playing together until Jack is called away for work. Charlie calls Jack out on his excuses and accepts that his dad will always disappoint him. Charlie pretends to call Lily to pick him up, but he is actually calling Berger so they can hang out.Berger brings Lizzie and Maya over, to Charlie's surprise (and horror). While talking to Maya, Charlie accidentally opens a secret passageway that leads to Jack's basement. The kids head downstairs and discover what appears to be a lab filled with gadgets and a mission log of all of The Guard's heroic activities, leading Charlie to realize that his father is The Guard. The kids begin playing around with the gadgets. At the same time, it's shown that Irons has been working for Argon, trying and failing to locate The Guard's power source. Argon gives Irons until the end of the week to shut the project down and take his team with him.The kids bring some gadgets to school to use to cheat on a test, and Charlie uses a wristband during his next baseball game to beat Forrest this time. However, their usage of gadgets, as well as Jack's G-Mobile, causes Irons and his team to pick up a signal and track the power source. The cops soon chase after the kids, but they manage to shake them off using more gadgets before they make it back to Jack's house. Jack leaves Charlie a message that he will be gone a little longer than expected.The kids continue to hang out in Jack's lair. Here, Maya recalls the incident between herself and Charlie - when they were five and at a birthday party, they nearly kissed until Charlie chickened out and told the kids that Maya had bad breath, leading to her getting the nickname ""Moldy Mouth Maya"". Charlie thinks this is why she left school, but she clarifies that her mom had gotten a job transfer. Soon, Irons and his team show up at the house. They manage to make it into the secret headquarters and contact Argon to head over before Irons locks the place down. Charlie manages to grab the power source before the villains find it. While Charlie, Berger, and Maya hide, the bad guys find Lizzie, as well as Big Mac (who turns out to be Lizzie's boyfriend) since he was there to pick her up. The two are held hostage and order Charlie to give up the power source. Charlie puts his hand on the source and sees visions of war and destruction if he gives it to Argon.Argon rigs the place with bombs before the rest of the kids come up with a plan. Berger uses a magnetic wand to hit Argon with a chair and throw him against the wall. They tie him up, and he explains how the power source works to them, as it is an alien artifact that adapts to the environment it inhabits. He wants to use the source to supposedly create weapons to solve the worlds problems, claiming that The Guard is selfish for keeping the power to himself. Charlie gives Argon the power source, but it turns out to be a fake that the kids made with a 3D printer. They cause a diversion by shutting off the power. Meanwhile, Jack sees security camera footage showing that Charlie and his friends are in danger, so he makes his way back home.The kids fight the villains for the power source until Irons gets his hands on it, which also allows him to see similar visions to what Charlie saw, and he realizes Argon cannot be trusted, since he is fully prepared to kill the kids and leave no witnesses. Berger uses the wand to grab the power source and throw it into a portal connected to his locker at school. Jack shows up, and he begins to defend the kids. Argon gets hold of one of Jack's gadgets and forms his own suit, while Jack cannot suit up because he is not fully powered. Argon kidnaps Berger and forces him to show him where the source is at the school. Charlie leads everyone, including Irons, to work together to stop Argon.The gang tries to 3D print jetpacks to head to the school. Lizzie tries to crack the system code while Charlie and Maya get trapped and nearly crushed by falling debris, at which point Charlie admits his feelings to Maya. Lizzie saves them, and they use jetpacks to fly together to head to the school, just as Argon's bombs go off and destroy the lair.As a dance goes on at school, Argon brings Berger to his locker, but one of his teachers took it out of the locker and realizes Argon is a bad guy, so she helps Berger run. Argon forces the other kids in the gym to clear out as he tries to get Berger and the source. Charlie, Jack, and the others arrive for the showdown. Jack suits up and fights Argon, leading to the final confrontation in the gym. Just as Argon tries to grab the power source, Charlie throws a grenade at it, which blows up and sends Argon through a portal. After everyone turns out to be okay, Charlie dances with Maya, and they have their first kiss.Charlie and Jack are later shown finally spending more time together. Charlie gets a distress signal, and Jack shows a new G-Mobile that Charlie can drive when he is older. They then head out on a heroic mission.The ending text/clips show that Irons now works as the head of Mission Control for The Guard, and he continues his podcast on alien things. Lizzie and Big Mac are still dating, and are planning for their own first kiss. Berger uses the portal device to become a DJ. Maya is supposedly interning for the CIA (but it is not confirmed). The Kincaids are now a crime-fighting family. Also, Argon is alive but trapped in another dimension, still stuck in his power suit.

He discovers Yosille was attempting to conjure the archangel of life, Martiel, so that he could bring back his dead wife Aida. He used Sarah for the ritual. But the ritual killed Sarah and conjured the demon Abyzou instead.Meanwhile, ""Aida"" comes to visit Claire and tells her she wants to see her husband's body. When Claire tells her husband Aida is here to see Yosille's body, Art realizes his wife is in danger. While Claire is on the phone, ""Aida"" burns Yosille's body, which releases the Abyzou. Art tries to rescue his wife, but is unable to.Art turns to Heimish and shows him Yosille's video. Heimish brings in Chayim for help. They discover the sigil and Chayim says that the demon gains strength and is fed when a child steps in it. Chayim explains the binding ritual and explains that Abyzou has to be trapped in a body. Art is willing to sacrifice himself for his wife and child.Abyzou kills Chayim, so Art and Heimish rush to begin the ritual. Heimish tells Art not to step outside the circle, but Heimish is taken by the demon. Art begins the ritual, but he sees his wife who is taken and threatened by the demon. He leaves the circle to rescue his wife who is being held against a high window.Unable to do anything else, Art finishes the inscription to force the demon inside him, but he is unable to kill himself. Heimish crawls to him and Art begs Heimish to stab him with the inscripted knife. Heimish reluctantly stabs Art, then tells him that he should have stayed in the circle. Heimish alludes to the amulet that has been taken off and flung across the room. Art then sees the real Heimish's dead body in the next room, and dies helplessly.Claire wakes up under a table. She rushes to the demon masquerading as Art, but looks down to see she is standing in the sigil. Abyzou appears and takes her.

Kath is middle-aged while he's in his thirties. They arrive at the cabin and find it double-booked. Al (Owen Teagues) tries to get them to leave, but Greta (Breanne Tju) let them stay for the night. Brianne and Al both have matching green coats. (Important later.) They are both twenty-somethings. (Age in a big theme, figures in the end.)Inside the cabin, Max finds a game, Pillow Talk, a game that ""reconnects lovers."" They all play the game. At one point, the game asks Kath to recount how she and Max met. Kath is a horticulturist who runs a store and teaches an adult class. Max was a student in the class. At the end of the class, he asked Kath out. At another point in the game, Greta is to lick the elbow of the player to the right (""the elbow is an erogenous zone""), which is Max. She licks and bites Max's elbow. Kath is weirded out and turns in for the night.In the morning, Kath wakes up to find the cabin empty. She walks out into the woods and finds Al distraught. He said that Max and Greta hooked up and have run off.Back in the city, Kath tries to process what happened with a friend who suggests she finds out who Greta is. She is unsuccessful in finding Greta online, but a search of the address of the cabin reveals the ownership deed with a number. She calls the owner, Nicholas Barlow (Dermot Mulroney). Kath wants Greta's number so she can return a book to her. Nick won't give out the number but will drive to Kath's nursery store to pick up the book.
At the store, Kath comes clean, and they have coffee. A passerby recognizes Nicholas in the shop and lays out who he is: a brilliant scientist who is now retired but was involved in a biotech startup. (The passerby mistakes Kath for a VC and pitches her on male cosmetics.) Later, Nicholas reveals that he left the startup because his father was wasting away and died from a genetic degenerative neuron disease. He left to be with him. Kath asks if he has the disease, and he says he is working on a treatment cure. Nicholas decides to help Kath.Flashback to a week earlier: Kath is hosting a dinner party for her Gen-X friends. Max is bored and trolls her friends. (One of her friends says songs on Spotify encode a cult message and Max says he was a victim.) He leaves to get more wine and runs into Al and Greta arguing in a liquor store.Cut to the present, Kath and Nicholas stake out Greta. Following Greta into a house party, Kath confronts Greta, who drops her smartphone with a screen-lock photo of her licking a sleeping Max's face. Kath leaves in disgust.Cut to the time when Max meets Greta and Al in the liquor store. Greta flirts with Max and invites him to a house party. There she flirts with him more and invites him to that cabin.Max returns two hours later. They argue, and Max blames Kath for being too old-fashioned and not spontaneous enough. He invites her to the cabin.Cut to Max and Kath driving to the cabin, but this time from Al and Greta's POV. They are expecting Max to be alone, and Al freaks out when he finds out he's not. In the morning, after Kath leaves, Al runs back to the cabin. Greta shows a drugged Max sleeping inside a plastic chemical barrel. She leans in to lick his face and takes a selfie. Before that, it is shown that Greta finds a letter in the cabin (important later).Kath and Nicholas are hitting it off. Nicholas says his cure is a transfusion treatment. Later, Kath drives to the cabin to give him a tiny avocado plant as a present. (He lives there and ""rented"" out the cabin.) He leaves to get wood to heat up water for tea and leaves a bundle of keys on the table. Kath riffs through his books and finds a photo of a younger Nicholas holding a baby. She turns the photo over, and it's a photo of Nicholas and Al! Al is his son.
.
Horrified, Kath grabs the keys and explores the cabin. She sees a shipping container in the woods. She walks to the container and unlocks it. Inside the containers are medical equipment and monitors, and Max is in a hospital bed hooked to a transfusion machine.In the woods, Nicholas meets Al and Greta, who are hiding out. (They were in the cabin when Kath arrived.) Deciding to confront Kath, they find her in the shipping container. Al and Greta are scientists (They were wearing the green lab coat to prepare to harvest Max that night.) Greta is the one who wants to use Max for harvesting, but she lets out a big secret: Nicholas is negative for having the degenerative neuron disease (the letter says negative test result), so Nicholas's motive for getting transfusion is to not age. Nicholas explains: he doesn't want to grow old and weak like his father and wants to spend more time with Al. He helps Kath out to keep tabs on her investigation but grew close to her. Hearing this, Kath plays to Nicholas's sympathy and says that she wants the transfusion too. She says she's dating Max to stay young, and every day of getting old scares her. That means Greta is to be harvested. Al and Nick subdue Greta with a sedative. But this is all a ruse as Kath tries to walk out with Max. A disoriented Max rips a tube out from his neck and promptly bleeds out. Kath runs out of the container and locks Al, Greta, and Nicholas inside. She sits in her car to collect herself and walks into the cabin, opens a window, and stares out.

Kate and Paul got married after she got pregnant in college. As time went on, Kate felt suffocated in the relationship with Paul. Kate eventually divorced Paul, but they remained friends with Kate acting as an occasional, though slightly inattentive, babysitter.Zoey (Gabrielle Union) married football player Dominic ""Dom"" Clayton (Timon Durrett) and had daughter Deja (Journee Brown) (wants to play basketball) and son DJ (Andre Robinson) (who wants to be a Lego designer and a comic book artist). Due to Dom's celebrity life, Zoey divorced him and took custody of the kids.
Paul met Zoey after she visited his small restaurant and suggested that he make the entire menu breakfast themed all day. The two eventually got married, expanded the restaurant, renamed it Baker's Breakfast and had two sets of twins: Luca (Leo Abelo Perry) and Luna (Mykal-Michelle Harris), and Bronx (Sebastian Cote) and Bailey (Christian Cote).Dom continues to be active in Deja and DJ's lives which slightly intimidates Paul as he was rarely there to begin with. While Deja prepares for her basketball scholarship, DJ feels that he connects with Paul more than Dom and would rather speak with him. Deja has a successful game in front of a scout and when Paul offers to celebrate, she decides to go for a 1:1 lunch with Dom instead.
Paul gets a meeting with a large company to expand his restaurant. He succeeds and has his famous sauce (that tastes Sweet, Salty and Savory depending on what you put it on) sold on shelves. The investors Melanie and Michelle buy out the company name and brand in exchange for the funding. He decides to use the money to move the family and their pet dogs Bark Obama and Joe Bitin' from Los Angeles to Calabasas, in a bigger house in a gated community. Deja is not happy as she would have to move to a new team.
As the sauce gets popular, the investors propose an expansion plan, which means more work for Paul.Upon arrival, Zoey begins to feel the effects of racial profiling, especially after meeting her neighbor Anne (June Diane Raphael). Paul suddenly gets a call informing him that his sister Rachel (Cynthia Murell) has checked into rehab, forcing him to take in his nephew Seth (Luke Prael), who has had a habit of being a thief. The kids are not happy about this decision, but they are not given a choice. Seth bonds with Haresh when he discovers that he is being picked on at the new school because of his ethnicity and teaches him to defend himself. Deja begins seeing a boy named Chris (Simeon Daise) and sneaks out of the house to see him.Paul finds himself having to travel to look for new places to expand his restaurant. The investors Melanie (Brittany Daniel) and Michele (Cynthia Daniel Hauser) also insist on altering some of his business ideals to cut costs. They also insist that Paul changes the brand name, as it is confusing with chains with a similar sounding name. He starts to miss out on being with his family which upsets Zoey as this was the reason she divorced Dom. Deja doesn't get game time, as the new coach keeps benching her in favor of other white kids on the team.
On DJ's birthday, Paul rushes to get home. During the party, things start to get out of hand as DJ changes his look to impress a girl, Haresh and Seth are suspended from school for a week after starting a fight with the kids who bullied Haresh, and Anne profiles Zoey's family for a series of recent break-ins. Upon Paul arriving, Deja reveals that she quit the basketball team and that the entire family has been unhappy since arriving in Calabasas. Feeling that Zoey can no longer handle their kids, Dom announces that he wants full custody of Deja and DJ.Harley and Ella accuse Seth of the break-ins after Haresh pointed out that he saw him stealing from the restaurant cash register, though he returned it and he angrily leaves. Upon realizing their mistake, the Bakers, Kate, and Dom all go out and find Seth. They apologize and admit that he is part of the family and he rejoins them.Back at home, Paul and Dom discuss their different upbringings; while Paul will never know what it is like to be at a disadvantage, Dom has to understand that being away from his kids has made him distant and that he needs to be more attentive. Realizing how much his family means to him, Paul breaks his deal with the company so that he can run the restaurant himself. The Bakers move back to Los Angeles and buy a new house. While having dinner, or rather breakfast, at the newly named Baker's Dozen Breakfast, Paul reveals the design of the sauce bottle has changed to reflect the family, Seth included.The end credits show Dom, Paul, and Zoey were able to invest their sauce and went National. Kate invented bird yoga. Seth moved back in with his mom after she got out of rehab, but still spends lots of time with his cousins. Deja and Chris soon started their freshman years at USC. Ella became the social manager for Harley's punk band and a video of her band playing at her school talent show broke the internet. Luna and Luca won the tennis national under 12 division becoming like Venus and Serena.

After realizing her mother is relentless and will not give up, Asha proposes a plan to Ravi that would be a win-win for both: a pretend relationship to be each other's date to get through the upcoming wedding season, as Asha is scheduled to attend 19 of these with her mom...

From this strange beginning, the narrative shifts to David (Luke Kleintank), an American journalist, who wakes up at an airport. He is moving to Latvia as a part of his job and meets his superior and friend Grant (Bruce Davison). He helps David with his accommodation, work, and other necessary arrangements. His place is close to both the train station and the office, where he is supposed to work. He also hands him over the keys to his car.Later, David goes to his workplace and gets familiar with his colleagues. At night, when he tries turning on the car, he finds it impossible. So, he walks up to his neighbor's place, planning to ask for help. Robert (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) opens the door and offers to share gas/fuel to make it start. Since this solution does not work, Robert pops by his garage and offers to help with the repair. He manages to get it started, which makes David think him being a mechanic. Robert denies this claim.When David decides to take the car out for a drive, Robert tags along. They have a casual chat about their lives and seem to be getting along pretty well. Since he does not know anyone in this new place, he asks Grant whether he will join him for a dinner later. He already has some other plans, which makes David asks Robert if he can come along for a drink. They go to a nearby pub and start drinking. That's where David comes across Janine (Ieva Florence) and gets instantly gets smitten by him.During their conversation, David mentions being a journalist and Janine mentions her bicycle when asked about her wristband. They dance together and have a good time, while Robert eyes them from a distance without interrupting them. When she is about to leave, she leaves her number written on David's arm. After that, David goes back to Robert, and they decide to leave. While driving back home on a pitch-dark night, they have a smoke together, and then try changing the music playing in his car.While he takes his attention away from the road in front of him, he ends up hitting someone with the car. They get out in complete shock and see a woman lying down with her bicycle. David realizes that it is Janine and gets even more confused about what he should do in this circumstance. While his gut feeling says to call the hospital and the authorities to inform them about his mistake, Robert warns him against doing so. Firstly, he was drunk driving, and she was not breathing afterward. He sees David getting convicted as a result of this for a murder where the evidence will go against him.Since David looks remorseful, Robert tries to calm him down saying it is not entirely his fault since the lights were not on. They leave the place, making it a case of hit-and-run. The next day, David confronts Robert for not letting him go to the police and indicates that he wants to. Robert implies that it is not just David but also him, who will get caught in case he does that. He resists every urge of David with the same method. Later, he goes to the scene of the crime and sees Janine's body being taken by an ambulance.He stops by at a nearby place and meets an old lady who he knows from before. He learns the details she remembers from the previous night. She notes seeing two silhouettes and a car and he understands that she can implicate them in the act. So, when the police knock on his door, he lies to them about her saying that she did not say anything about the accident. Meanwhile, David is conflicted with his feelings of guilt. While his job as a journalist is to uncover the truth, he cannot work on this case. The burden weighs heavy on his conscience.While he goes to a press conference about Janine's murder, he meets her sister - Vanessa (Eloise Smyth), who comes there from England to get to the bottom of the case. She asks David to help her with the same when he is left with no other option but to give empty promises. On the other side, David and Robert become more and more distant due to their different viewpoints. David feels that the truth will come out sooner or later, and Robert suggests lying about the night when they left the pub and returned by tram. He also advises claiming his car (that has a bump due to the incident) was stolen, while he sinks into a water body.During the emotional drift between these two neighbors, Vanessa and David get emotionally closer. Their romantic interest enrages Robert, thinking that it would make it difficult for them to hide their crime. Meanwhile, Grant speaks with David about Robert, who he always considered to be a bit strange. While that opinion impacts his judgment about this neighbor, his violent acts out of jealousy about Vanessa being closer to him, make him despise the person. When the couple decides to go kayaking, he shows up there as a surprise and tries to kill her.Sometime later, the police officers show up at David's house when he was with Vanessa. They mention a call by him which he notes to be a mistake. It makes Vanessa realize that he knew Janine from before but did not utter a word about it. While she becomes enraged, he mentions not knowing that he did not know that it was Janine who got killed that day. Her suspicion of David's involvement gets even bigger when she finds out that he lied about his return journey. While he mentioned returning by tram late at night, the last one is at 10:30 PM.She then goes back to David's place to confront him about it. He is not home, and she meets Robert. During their conversation, he realizes that she knows their secret, and he strangles her. When David returns home, Robert welcomes him and shares a tour ticket for him to leave the place for a while. He calls it a friendly gesture, but it ends up making him more frustrated. Right after Robert returns to his place, David calls Vanessa's number wanting to tell her about her sister. However, Robert, who strangled Vanessa earlier, has her phone and cuts that call. He realizes that David is eventually going to convict himself of the crime.When David goes to his office, a colleague informs him that their meeting is canceled since she could not get hold of Grant on the phone. He goes to Grant's office, sees a gift basket on his basket, and realizes Robert giving it to him. He rushes out to Vanessa's place but cannot get in touch with her. That's when he receives a call from her, and Robert starts speaking. He mentions that she is with him. He mentions planning to take her fishing. So, David realizes Robert's ill intentions and drives back to his home as fast as he can.Meanwhile, Robert tells Vanessa that it was he who convinced David that Janine was dead that night and made him run away. The reason why he went through all this trouble is that he saw David as a brother he never had and did not want to lose the bond they had built. By the time David reaches home, Robert already hits her so hard that she dies. While David confronts him, Robert keeps mentioning doing everything for him. He keeps asking for forgiveness when David walks out with a weapon in his hand.That is when the police show up at this place and arrest David. They convict him in all these crimes and Robert shows himself as an innocent person. The police then tell him that Vanessa's alive. The police reached there at the time because Robert called them before. So, it was his plan to save himself from conviction. However, upon learning of Vanessa, he realizes that she would tell the truth about him.When the ambulance takes her away, David overhears her pulse is stable. He smiles taking it as a sign of him being proven not guilty. On the other side, Robert sinks himself in the same lake, tied to the anchor - the same image that we see in the opening shot. Unlike David, who had a conflict of conscience, Robert does not show an iota of remorse, and his psychopathic tendencies are revealed slowly over the period. (thanks to highonfilms)",The budding friendship between two very different neighbours takes a tragic turn when David runs over a young woman and causes her death.

Impressed by his zeal and guts, a woman named Estelle calls him to her night bar in Miami. Without going much into the background, the film informs us that Estelle is some sort of kingpin who runs a prostitution ring in the area. She doesn't waste a moment and immediately informs Stray that she herself has fought her way up the ladder, which is the reason she is especially interested in him; he seems like a hustler to her. Estelle teams up Stray with her most trusted hitman, Mr. Cuda, who drives Stray to South Beach to eliminate a target named Ronnie Fennech. Ronnie owes a lot of money to Estelle and has failed to pay her back, which is why she sent Mr. Cuda to finish him off. But even though Mr. Cuda and Stray finish the mission successfully, Cuda doesn't like Stray's amateur working style and thus sends him off.The very next morning, Cuda pays a visit to his 15-year-old daughter, Lola. It is the first time Cuda meets her after coming out of prison. In an effort to mend his relationship with his daughter, Cuda hands her some money and asks her what she wants for her upcoming 16th birthday. However, it is apparent that Lola doesn't like her father visiting her at school and hence quickly takes a leave from there. Later, we find Cuda near a beach, where he meets another 15-year-old girl named Billie, who has run away from her foster parent's house in Atlanta and has come to Miami to start a new life. A woman catches Billie shoplifting, and as soon as Cuda hears the fuss, he quickly comes to Billie's rescue. Cuda takes Billie to a joint and advises her not to roam the streets of Miami, as they are not safe for a young girl like her. Out of generosity, Cuda pays for a hotel room so that Billie can stay there for a week and, in the meantime, find suitable work to survive in the city. He even hands her some cash along with a golden-colored money clip. Cuda saw a glimpse of his daughter, Lola, in Billie, which could be one of the many reasons why he was so supportive of her. His relationship with Billie eventually becomes a turning point in Cuda's character and his criminal life.Later that night, an unknown man kidnaps Billie from her hotel room, and as soon as Cuda finds out about it, he starts looking for her. He even approaches Stray and asks for his help to find Billie. During a debt collection in a Chinese restaurant, Cuda spots the golden money clip in his hand, which he had given to Billie. Cuda starts following the leads and ends up discovering that it was the hotel manager who had sold Bille to a guy named Freddie, who runs a webcam factory in Midtown. Freddie abducts or buys girls through his corrupt ways and later forces them to do obscene scenes for the internet creeps through which he is earning a lot of money. But even though Cuda finds out that it is Freddie who has kidnapped Billie, he cannot help her because Freddie has paid half a million dollars to Estelle as protection money, and if Cuda decides to attack Freddie in order to save Billie, then it will ignite a war between him and Estelle. So, will Cuda raise his arms against his own owner in order to clear his conscience? Absolutely yes, and that is what brings about a much-deserved closure in his character.What Happens To Stray, Billie, And Lexus?
Cuda tried to convince Estelle to allow him to stop Freddie. However, as it was apparent, Estelle was more interested in money than Cuda's newfound empathy towards the underage girl. She knew it was time for Cuda to retire and thus ordered her bodyguard, Doom, to kill him. Suddenly, Stray arrived at Estelle's office with the bags Freddie had given to him. At this point, Stray had two choices. Either to stay loyal to Estelle and witness the death of his friend-cum-mentor, Cuda, or help Cuda and start a war with Estelle. Fortunately, Stray chose Cuda over Estelle, and during the fight with Doom, he unclipped the shotgun hanging on his vest. While Doom was trying to suffocate Cuda to death, Cuda quickly grasped the shotgun and killed Doom. In a fit of rage, Estelle tried to shoot Stray, but suddenly, Lexus arrived and shot Estelle. Lexus or Sloane used to work at Estelle's night bar as a prostitute and a dancer, but as soon as she fell in love with Stray, she hoped for a completely different life and yearned to escape. Hence, shooting Estelle meant that not only did she free herself from Estelle's prostitution ring but also saved Stray from having a similar fate as Cuda. A bleeding Cuda asked them to take the money and run while he went to the old cookie factory in Midtown, where Freddie had kept Billie captive along with several other girls.Quite heroically, Cuda saved all the girls and shot down Freddie's men. However, as soon as he stepped into Freddie's den, Freddie, hiding in the dark, shot him in the stomach. Freddie wanted to see Cuda bleed to death, but fortunately, Billie, who had been unlocked by one of the girls, arrived there and picked up Cuda's gun, with which she shot Freddie. At this point, Billie wanted to shoot Cuda, too, as she believed he was the one who had sold her to Freddie, but Cuda quickly cleared her misunderstanding, and together they left the factory, leaving Freddie to die. Cuda drove to a location where he had already called Stray and Lexus, and there he requested Stray to take Billie with him and leave Florida as soon as possible. He ordered him to take half a million dollars and travel to a place that is far, far away from Miami. Somewhere, no one will ever be able to find them.Stray took his mentor's advice and shifted with Billie and Lexus to a cold region in the mountains far away from the shores. They had built a peaceful life for themselves, and Stray opened an auto repair shop under his real name, ""Ricky."" Once, Cuda had told Stray that he had quite a talent in fixing automobiles, and indeed, Stray remembered that compliment, which influenced his decision to enter into the same line of business in order to live a life worth living. Nevertheless, he had half a million dollars with him and could have survived even without it.'The Enforcer' Ending Explained: Is Cuda Dead?
After bidding goodbye to Billie, Cuda drove to his daughter's school, where he left his ""barracuda"" car for her. It was the perfect birthday present for Lola. At the beginning of the film, when Cuda had asked Billie for her advice on what he should give to his 16-year-old daughter, Billie told him that whatever he wanted to give should come from his heart and, more than that, it should be something that only he could give. We rarely see Cuda without his car in ""The Enforcer,"" so it becomes an extension of his personality. The car would always remind Lola of her father since there was no other legacy that Cuda could hand over to her.Soon after leaving his car, Cuda walked to the shore of one of the beaches in Miami, where he took his last breath. The last scene reminded us of the painting that Cuda had bought from a fine art gallery, probably run by his ex-wife. As soon as Cuda saw the painting for the first time, something struck him. In the painting, we see a man sitting by the shore under a tree, living the most peaceful life. Probably, Cuda too yearned for such calmness, which is why we always saw him roaming around the beaches when he was not killing people or collecting debts. During his final moments, Cuda sat under the tree just like the man whom we saw in the painting and died there in peace. In the last scene, we see the same painting in Stray's or Ricky's garage. This suggests that Cuda might not have been able to live a peaceful life himself, as depicted in the painting, but he indeed helped Stray, Lexus, and Billie to live one. By sacrificing himself, he saved three lives, and for him, it was his redemption.

She has a jar full off sulfuric acid and she threatens the host with it. The host said the show was on a budget and that's why the wishes never came true.

While Brady films his latest video of two soldiers making love, Dylan bursts into his room and takes the camera, which he uses the film himself practicing pick-up lines. He and his friends Kurt (Tyler Lofton), Mark (Cree Kawa) and Boner (Duncan Anderson) exclude Brady from their activities, thinking him to be a hopeless loser. The friends then go out to pull some pranks on the neighborhood residents and each other including drawing a penis on Boner's forehead and made him slap cream on his privates. Then, they perform tricks at the local skatepark. The group also discover a large patch of snakeskin near a field and are a bit disgusted by it. They taunted Boner to eat it for 50 cents. After concealing the camera and using it in an attempt to get secret up-skirt photos of two girls, the teens become fixated on Sandra (Emily Sweet), an attractive blonde who has moved into the house across the street from Brady and Dylan's house, whose yard is revealed to be decorated with several stone busts. As the boys film her washing her car from Brady's window, they are interrupted by a deliveryman who hands Sandra a Macintosh computer. Brady later meets and befriends Sandra, who invites him into her house while he attempts to rollerskate, much to Dylan's shock and jealousy. Upon Brady's return, Kurt, Mark and Boner compliment him for his newfound relationship with Sandra. When they beg him for information, Brady tells him that Sandra invited him back to help set up a new webcam. Dylan and his friends enlist Brady to follow through on this promise, pressuring him into installing spyware on her computer, intending to hack into her webcam in the hopes of seeing her nude. Brady reluctantly agrees and returns to Sandra's house that night. Although he is nearly caught, he manages to install the spyware, despite being wracked with guilt for spying on Sandra and betraying her trust. Unbothered, Dylan and his friends watch Sandra as she undresses as Brady leaves the room. The boys are horrified to witness Sandra bending her limbs, ripping off her scalp, uncovering hair made of snakes and revealing that she is actually a gorgon.

As Dylan flees, Brady arrives and attempts to reason with Sandra, apologizing for violating her privacy. Not accepting his apology, Sandra turns Brady to stone, then proceeds to petrify Dylan as well. Now fully transformed, she slowly approaches the camera, stuck in Dylan's stony hand, as the tape comes to an end.""To Hell And Back"":On New Year's Eve 1999, best friends and videographers Nate (Archelaus Cristano) and Troy (Joseph Winter) have been hired by what is revealed to be a coven of witches. Their task is to film the witches performing a ritual where a woman named Kirsten (Tori Pence) volunteers to be offered as a vessel to a powerful demon known as Ukabon (Dustin Watts). Despite agreeing to film the ritual, Nate is notably skeptical of his clients and thinks that the ritual may be a prank. The witches performing the ritual tell the duo that while they call to Ukabon, they will not actually summon it until the stroke of midnight on the new millennium, when the veil between Earth and Hell is at its thinnest. As the ritual begins, Ferkus, an uninvited demon who has disrupted the coven's rituals before, makes its presence known. As the witches attempt to cast it out, Ferkus grabs Nate and Troy and drags them underneath the witches' altar. As his camera glimpses Ferkus retreating, Troy slowly discovers that he and Nate have been sent to Hell. The duo encounter bloodthirsty demons, hazardous traps, and mutilated bodies spread throughout the cavernous landscape, prompting Nate to arm himself with a discarded pitchfork as a means of protection. As they make their way across Hell, Nate and Troy cross paths with Mabel (Melanie Stone), a damned soul who speaks in archaic terms and can tell that they are mortal, thus making them irresistible to hungry demons. She decides to help them escape by leading them to Ukabon, whom she hates, in exchange for the two of them writing her name in the witches' spell book. Nate and Troy also remember how the witches told them that the veil between Earth and Hell is weakest at midnight, and since Ukabon is the only conduit through which the duo can return to Earth, they have only minutes to find them before they are stuck in Hell for eternity. While trekking across Hell, the group encounters more demons, and Nate and Troy bicker with one another constantly over their predicament, confusing Mabel with their modern ways of speaking. Eventually, the group enters a cave where they find Ukabon, surrounded by a cult of masked demons, preparing to enter Kirsten's body. The demon cultists attack the trio, but Nate and Troy manage to kill them. As midnight rapidly approaches, Nate and Troy shout at Mabel to come with them to Earth. She is unfortunately stabbed by one of the cultists, reminding them to write her name in the book. The two friends jump inside Ukabon's cavernous stomach just as the ritual commences. The duo successfully return to Earth, albeit with Nate possessing Kirsten's body. Furious that their ritual has failed, the witches kill Nate and Troy before arguing with one another about what went wrong. A dying Troy uses his blood to write Mabel's name in the book the witches used to summon Ukabon, then succumbs to his injuries before the tape ends.""The Gawkers (Final Frame)"":
The tape returns to the previous segment, showing Dylan and Brady's stone bodies before the camera's battery runs out.As the credits end, the witches can be heard performing their ritual again, this time calling Mabel's name, hinting that she will return to Earth. Then, a final clip of Brady's video shows a soldier spying on enemies, but gets ran over by a tank - presumably Johnson's - and the clip ends.","Witness a hellish vision of 1999, as social isolation, analog technology and disturbing home videos fuse into a nightmare of found footage savagery."

One of the workers the Rivers hired to remodel the house hands Julie an old bracelet he found while doing maintenance on the drain, assuming it belongs to her. Julie chooses to keep the bracelet, despite it not being hers. The Rivers enter the bedroom, where they find their Seal Point Ragdoll[1] cat, Lou, wandering around. Daniel is exhausted from managing the house renovation, but he is happy in his marriage as is Julie, who is seven months pregnant and due to give birth in two months.That night, Julie is fixing the bracelet she received earlier in the day, and she puts it on her wrist. She then picks up a box she brought with her but puts it down when she hears a child whispering down the hall. Lou appears to hear it too, as Julie sees her cat hissing at a tarp-covered doorway while going to investigate. Julie is then startled by Daniel, who brings her into what will be the baby's room. He excitedly shows her the crib and baby monitor in the corner, which can record video, and is connected to a microphone. Later on that night, the couple attends an academia banquet hosted by Dean Whittier and his wife. Julie strikes up a conversation with Dean's wife about hers and Daniel's move to the lakeshore house. Dean's wife asks Julie if the child she is pregnant with is her first, but Daniel cuts in with a yes before Julie can answer.When Julie and Daniel return home, they get into an argument. As it turns out, the baby Julie is pregnant with is not hers and Daniel's first child. Several years prior, they were supposed to have a son, but he was tragically stillborn. Julie is upset with Daniel for not being honest about the loss of their son, and while heading upstairs, she is startled at the sight of a little boy, and trips, suffering a nasty fall.After recalling the stillbirth of her son, Julie awakens in the hospital. The doctor seeing the couple, Dr. Meadows, reveals to the Rivers that even though Julie suffered a partial placental abruption from the fall, she and the baby are both fine. However, as a precautionary measure, Dr. Meadows places Julie on mandatory bed rest for the remainder of her pregnancy. This means that in the 8 weeks leading up to delivery, Julie cannot drive or do any heavy lifting or other physical activities barring the occasional trip to the bathroom. Dr. Meadows also emphasizes the importance of Julie avoiding stress, and strongly recommends putting all renovations on hold until the baby is born. A few days later, Julie is discharged from the hospital, and is helped into bed by Daniel once they get home. Noticing his wife's unhappiness, Daniel attempts to cheer her up by showing her the useful things he set up in the bedroom, such as a tool for grabbing things, an iPad, her laptop, and a pair of two-way walkie-talkies.On her first day of bed rest, with 55 days remaining until the due date, Julie tries to do some work on her laptop, spends some time watching TV, and uses the grabbing tool to enable her to play with Lou. While using the bathroom, Julie hears a child laughing and a baby crying, so she returns to the bedroom to investigate. Seeing the closet door crack open on its own, Julie goes to see what's behind it, only to find nothing there. Daniel returns home and scolds Julie for being out of bed for too long upon seeing a UPS box in the bedroom, deducing that she must have gone downstairs to retrieve it. He and Julie fight again, and the latter expresses her irritation with her constraints. Daniel apologizes, understanding Julie's frustration and remembering Dr. Meadows' advice about his wife avoiding stress before thanking their unborn daughter for behaving herself. That night, a storm comes, and Julie has a hard time falling asleep. She hears the closet door creak again, and a flash of lightning reveals a child peeking from behind it. Julie frantically wakes up Daniel, who checks the closet and finds no one inside, much to her confusion.12 days pass, and Julie is now on day 13 of bed rest, with 43 days left until the due date. Julie is sitting by a window, watching TV and cleaning the bracelet she had been given. Julie notices a little boy playing out in the snow, and she calls out to him, asking where his mother is. The boy points at her before the window abruptly slams shut. An alert comes on the baby monitor, but it's only Lou. Despite this, Julie keeps checking the nursery, and spots the reflection of someone's face in the mirror. Julie frantically dials 911 to report the intruder. Daniel returns home just as Julie finishes telling the police officer on site what she had seen. The officer says that he was unable to find anyone. Once the officer leaves, Julie and Daniel get into yet another argument because the latter thinks the former is once again relapsing. Unwilling to see his wife in her current state any longer, Daniel decides to hire a babysitter to watch over Julie, much to her disdain. Night falls, and Julie once again has a hard time falling asleep. She takes out the box from before, and looks through the contents, which include toys that were supposed to be for her stillborn son, Andrew. Julie cries herself to sleep over her dead son, but is woken up by an object moving on the ceiling, which is Andrew's toy car. After seeing a little boy run out of the room, Julie begins to suspect that she received a visit from her son's ghost. She tries to call out to Andrew through the baby monitor, before being interrupted by Daniel.It is now day 23 of Julie's bed rest, with 33 days remaining until the baby is due. Daniel has hired a nurse named Delmy Walker to watch over Julie while he is at work. Delmy gives Julie a health exam before discussing the latter's past history. It is revealed that after Andrew's stillbirth, Julie had an episode of postpartum psychosis, which required a six-week stay in a mental hospital. Delmy then confides in Julie that she tried several times and failed to become a mother because she was barren and took her job as a doula so she could consider herself an honorary mother by helping other mothers deliver their babies.A week goes by, and Julie is now on day 29 of bed rest, with 27 days remaining until she gives birth. Delmy helps Julie into the bathtub before temporarily leaving the room. As soon as Delmy is out, Julie sees Andrew's reflection in the mirror, and she experiences a pain in her stomach. Dr. Meadows comes to the house to check on Julie and her unborn daughter and tells Julie that she was dealing with Braxton Hicks contractions. Dr. Meadows asks Julie to tell him about the boy she's been seeing, having been informed of her mental state by Daniel and Delmy. Feeling like Julie is dealing with postpartum psychosis again, Dr. Meadows prescribes Julie a medication and tells Daniel about the possibility of admitting his wife to a mental facility should the medication not work, which is overheard by an eavesdropping and miffed Julie.Delmy begins giving Julie her medicine that very night. The days pass, and Julie now appears to be stress-free, enjoying her time with Delmy. On day 38 of Julie's bed rest, with 18 days left until the baby is due, things begin to go downhill once again when even Lou begins to see the boy. Julie calls for Andrew that night through the baby monitor.It is now day 46 of Julie's bed rest, with 10 days left until she is set to give birth. Julie, who is in the bathtub, calls for Andrew, and his spirit appears in the bathroom, much to her delight. Andrew, however, warns his mother that she needs to leave, and that 'she wants baby sister'. Julie asks her son who he is talking about, but disappears when Delmy re-enters the bathroom. This causes Julie to begin to suspect that Delmy has nefarious intentions for her and her daughter, and she shares her concerns and Andrew's warning with Daniel. They argue once more, and Daniel storms out in frustration before heading into the nursery and turning off the baby monitor's camera.Another week passes, and three days remain until Julie's due date. Delmy gives Julie another health exam before telling her a story about a family that once lived in the area. The couple had three kids, and the mother was pregnant with a fourth child. The couple had been on their way to the hospital to have their fourth child when their car skidded on some ice and crashed, taking their unborn daughter's life. Afterwards, the wife fell into a deep depression, and eventually killed herself. Julie asks what the mother's name was, and Delmy answers that the woman's name was Melandra Kinsey. Julie glances at the bracelet on her wrist and finds a charm with the initials 'MK' on it. With her curiosity piqued even further, Julie pulls out the deeds to the house, and discovers that a couple with the surname 'Kinsey' previously owned the house, and that the wife's name was Melandra. Julie calls the local newspaper, The Daily Courier, inquiring if they had any archived articles about a woman named Melandra Kinsey who committed suicide in the late '60s.It is now the last day of Julie's bed rest. Julie is alone in the bedroom with Lou, and Daniel is on his way home. Julie connects her cell phone to the Roomba and utilizes it to see what's going on in the nursery. Julie sees Andrew once again, and asks him if Melandra Kinsey is the person who wants her baby. Andrew runs away hearing Melandra's name, and Julie sees him standing with two other boys before the camera dies. After hearing heavy footsteps and seeing ghostly hands on her stomach, Julie calls out for Delmy. Thinking that Julie is in the early stages of labor, Delmy goes to get dressed.Julie then gets an email from the Daily Courier with the article she had previously requested, and she clicks on the link. While reading through the article, Julie is horrified when she learns that Melandra drowned her three sons in the bathtub before taking her own life. It then becomes clear to Julie that Melandra was the woman Andrew was warning her about, and that she wants to take Julie's baby so she could replace the daughter she lost. When Delmy re-enters the room with Daniel, Julie begs to be taken to the hospital because Melandra Kinsey is in the house and wants the baby. Julie has a contraction, and Daniel and Delmy begin to witness the paranormal activity for themselves. Realizing that his wife was right all along, Daniel tells Delmy to get the wheelchair for Julie, but it is supernaturally thrown to the side. Delmy yells at Melandra to leave Julie alone, but an unseen force yanks her out the window to her death. Julie and Daniel run for their lives, but Melandra refuses to let them leave. Daniel is hit on the head with a tool, and is knocked unconscious. Julie's water breaks, and she uses one of the walkie-talkies to try and call the police for help but is yanked into the bathroom and then into the unused bathtub. Melandra's ghost is then seen rounding a corner, heading for the bathroom.Julie gives birth to her daughter in the tub, and Melandra appears in the bathroom seconds later, attempting to suck the life out of the baby. While attempting to fight back, Julie realizes that the floor underneath the tub is made of rotted wood. She shakes the bathtub until the floor underneath her caves, sending the tub crashing down to the first floor with Julie and the baby inside. The baby is alive, but Julie is dying from her injuries. Hearing the baby crying, a now awake Daniel rushes to tend to his wife and newborn child. A weakened Julie urges Daniel to take his daughter and flee. Daniel takes his daughter and attempts to break the front doors down, but they won't budge. Melandra enters the foyer, refusing to be denied. As Melandra advances on Daniel and the baby, Julie rises up, determined to protect her daughter. She puts Melandra into a chokehold, loudly proclaiming 'this is my child' before ordering the ghost to leave. Melandra is sucked out and banished to the afterlife.Reveling in her victory, Julie calls out to Daniel, but he does not hear her. Paramedics arrive at the house, and Daniel yells to them for help. Julie then sees her own corpse amongst the wreckage of the bathtub, and comes to the realization that she has died. As Julie watches the paramedics frantically attempt to revive her, she breaks down in sorrow before the little boy's ghost appears and guides her to a room where Andrew is waiting for her in a crib. Julie holds Andrew in her arms, overjoyed to finally have the experience she had been robbed of years ago. As Julie readies herself to enter heaven with her son, she feels herself being summoned back to her body. Delmy's ghost appears, and Julie, realizing that her husband and newborn daughter need her, asks Delmy to take care of her son until her time is up. Delmy agrees, and Julie bids her son farewell. Julie then watches as Delmy ascends to heaven with Andrew before being revived by the paramedics.The movie ends a year later, with Daniel playing with his now one-year-old daughter and Lou the cat, before Julie enters and joins in on the fun.

They'd wanted to run away together, but before that could happen, Leanne was taken away by her mother to Boston. Bayou spends years writing to her, but none of his letters reach Leanne. Eventually, however, they meet each other again, but this time, the situation is a lot direr than it was before. Now, Leanne is passing as a white person and is married to the man who is to be the mayor of the town which is racist, through and through. While Leanne feels trapped in a marriage that she was forced into by her mother, seeing Bayou again gives her hope. However, their reunion is short-lived when Leanne's mother wrongfully accuses Bayou of whistling at Leanne. This angers the white men of the town and they decide to make Bayou pay for it. Before they can kill him, he runs away to Chicago.From the beginning of the film, we find a strong sibling rivalry between Willie Earl and Bayou, with a major part of it exhibited by the older sibling. Bayou is treated as an outcast within his family, and his father favors Willie Earl, mainly because he learned to play the trumpet quicker. While Bayou has a beautiful voice, he could never do what his father wanted, while Willie Earl dedicated himself to the man. When their father leaves for Chicago, Willie Earl doesn't bat an eye before following him, even though he is told not to.Sheltered by his father, Willie Earl grew up believing that he was better than Bayou in every aspect. While he was good at playing trumpet, his talent didn't make him stand out. Still, much like his father, Willie Earl was delusional about his abilities. He had big dreams and he might even have achieved them, but he was simply not dedicated enough for it, unlike Bayou. It was Willie Earl's plan to go to Chicago and become a successful musician. He spends years in the city, to no avail. When he crosses paths with Ira, he thinks he might finally have it all. But then circumstances lead to Bayou accompanying them on the trip, which is where everything starts to go south for Willie Earl.Ira knew that Willie Earl needed something more if he wanted to make it as a musician. The spark that he lacked, Ira finds in Bayou. When the time comes to audition, it is Bayou who stays and actually auditions, as opposed to Willie Earl who leaves when the first trouble comes along the way. Still, Ira gets the gig for both brothers, tagged along with the actual deal that is signed by Bayou. As his younger brother flourishes, Willie Earl's career starts to go downhill. He gets hooked on drugs, which further affects his work ethic. As Bayou finds more success, Willie Earl becomes jealous of him. He starts resenting him for taking away what should have been rightfully his. He was the one who followed after their father and spent all that time in Chicago trying to make it. But here was Bayou, who had things served to him on a silver platter and took everything away that Willie Earl had worked for.The final straw for Willie Earl arrives when he is fired. He doesn't stop to think that his addiction and the problems that he created at the workplace might have something to do with it. Instead, he blames it all on Bayou and he wants him to pay for it. It is when Bayou decides to go back home that his older brother finds his opportunity. Everyone knew how dangerous it was for Bayou to be there. But Bayou reckons that Leanne's husband and his brother would probably not remember him because enough time had passed. Once back in town, Willie Earl goes straight to the sheriff and not only reminds him about Bayou but also tells him exactly where to find his brother. This leads the mob to descend on Bayou and kill him.","Follows an investigation into an unsolved murder unveiling a story full of forbidden love, deceit and a secret."

Leonetti'],"Rachel and John have just welcomed their newborn son, Eli, and get settled into their new apartment along with John's beloved childhood pet cockatoo.Prior to Eli's birth, Rachel's sister Vivian was hospitalized after the death of her own infant son Zachary, so their mother sent Zachary's old things for use by Rachel's new baby. While going through the boxes, Rachel discovers an old Hebrew children's book, and explores it with John (who has learned Hebrew following his religious conversion), and after finding the tune, Rachel sings it to Eli to put him to sleep.Shortly after, Rachel and John both begin to experience vivid hallucinations of an old hag. At one point, the apartment loses power, and Rachel runs out of the apartment following disturbances by the hag, insisting there is an intruder, and John investigates. Armed in the dark with a fireplace poker, John is startled by his cockatoo flying past him, and strikes it out of the air, killing it. John grieves, as it is a pet he has had since he was 11 years old. The incident culminates a series of small frustrations that begins to drive a wedge between Rachel and John.Finally, Rachel elects to visit Vivian in the hospital to try to get an explanation for the book. Vivian is shaken to hear Rachel has discovered the book, as she instructed her mother to discard it. Vivian explains to Rachel that the lullaby is a conjure song for Lilith, a demon in Jewish folklore who is said to be Adam's first wife in the Bible. According to the lore, Lilith was cast out of the Garden of Eden for her unwillingness to submit as Adam's wife. Wandering the earth alone, she gave birth to flawed and grotesque babies, as Adam and his new wife Eve gave birth to perfect ones - humans. In vengeance and jealousy, she becomes a demon, and spirits away the human babies of all those who sing her lullaby - a song initially sung to her by Adam, which she twisted into a summoning spell. Vivian tells Rachel that her son Zachary was not killed, but taken by Lilith, and they urgently must return to the apartment to protect Eli.Meanwhile, John visits the synagogue to receives help from the Rabbi. She informs him that Vivian came to her with the same concerns, but there is nothing she can do to help. Shortly after, John receives a mysterious phone call instructing him to come to a local address, where he will receive the answers he seeks. John arrives at the sequestered practice of Rabbi Cohen, who is known for performing Jewish services that will not be honored by the greater church, due to their taboo or unorthodox nature. John brings the book to Rabbi Cohen, and hears the story of Lilith. Rabbi Cohen explains that the hag haunting John and Rachel is a minion of Lilith known as the Crone. She is the first in a series of agents dispatched by Lilith to claim Eli. The next set of agents will be Lilith's own young, the Lilim - the grotesque, distorted babies birthed after her banishment. John is also informed that the accidental killing of his cockatoo was a deliberate part of Lilith's summoning ritual, which is the slaughter of a beast considered ""unclean"" to Judaism. This leaves the final ritual, which is the spilling of the blood of the infant to be taken by Lilith. If Eli sustains a bloody injury, the ritual will finalize, and he will be abducted and replaced with a dead golem.Rabbi Cohen sends John home with instructions on dispelling Lilith's agents, but does not allow him to leave with the lullaby book.Rachel and Vivian are the first to return to the apartment. Vivian covers the mirrors, warning that they are portals. Overwhelmed, Rachel hands Eli off to Vivian to step to the bathroom and recuperate. While there, she overhears Vivian singing Lilith's lullaby to Eli.Rachel carefully steps back into the room, finding Vivian in a chair cradling Eli, happily singing the lullaby. Vivian tells her that her plan is to prick Eli's finger to summon Lilith, and will follow behind Lilith to her realm to reclaim Zachary. She also reveals she never instructed her mother to discard the book, as she fully intended it to be found by Rachel. Vivian urges Rachel's trust, as this will ensure both Eli and Zachary are returned safely. Rachel feigns cooperation long enough to retrieve Eli from Vivian's arms and return him to his cradle. Rachel then attacks Vivian, and the two struggle in the hallway. Ultimately, an agent of Lilith arrives to cut Eli, and he is taken through a nearby standing mirror and replaced with a golem. Rachel stares down hopelessly at the golem in Eli's crib, until she turns to face the mirror and is pulled through by Vivian, who has already walked through.Rachel arrives in the first area of Lilith's realm, on the other side of the mirror, where she is able to see into Eli's room as though a window. Rachel nearly sinks into a pile of animated golems, until she is saved by Vivian, who pulls her along to continue.They traverse a series of hallways, all populated by wall mirrors where she can see into the bedrooms of other couples with infant children, via the mirrors in their own rooms. They arrive at the final room, a room full of cribs containing the babies successfully taken by Lilith. As Rachel clamors to each crib looking for Eli, Vivian seeks Zachary.Rachel successfully finds Eli, but is caught by Lilith, who throws her back and reclaims Eli, placing him back in the crib. Rachel lunges at Lilith, but is grabbed, and Lilith begins to sing her lullaby to Rachel, slowly draining the life from her. Before Lilith can kill Rachel, she is ambushed by Vivian, who thrusts Eli into Rachel's arms and instructs her to run. Vivian apologizes for what she's done, and sacrifices herself as a distraction for Rachel's escape, as Lilith sings to her and drains her life away. Rachel flees through the mirrored hallways, pursued by Lilith, looking for the mirror in her own home.Meanwhile, in the apartment, John has arrived to discover the golem. Rachel locates the living room mirror and bangs on the mirror to let John know she is on the other side. Per the instructions of Rabbi Cohen, John has lit a candle to expel Lilith's agents, and is reciting the Hebrew prayers to close the portal to Lilith's world. John's prayers successfully soften the portal, and Rachel breaks through with Eli, shattering the mirror and closing the portal.John and Rachel embrace on the floor in their success, and Rachel checks Eli, bundled up in his blankets. Rachel discovers a birthmark that Eli did not have, and realizes Vivian secretly gave her Zachary instead of Eli. Vivian rescued Zachary, leaving Eli imprisoned in Lilith's realm.Some time passes, and Zachary is now a walking toddler. One of Rabbi Cohen's men meets John in a park and hands over the book. He confirms that Rabbi Cohen does not know the book is missing. John returns with the book to Rachel, who sits with Zachary. Exchanging few words, they ponder their next move.","A new mother discovers a lullaby in an ancient book and soon regards the song as a blessing, but her world transforms into a nightmare when the lullaby brings forth the ancient demon Lilith."

Johnson'],"In the present day, 3 private agents are tracking a target in Antwerp, Belgium. They are supported by a local strike team Bundy and Manson, who covertly attack the target inside his home. But the target is prepared and launches a counterattack on the operatives. The target improvises normal house-hold appliances to convert them into weapons. This prompts the agents to come out and assist their strike team. When the team gets there, the target surrenders and the team have to fight off Belgian police to extract the target.5 weeks ago, CIA Agents Harris (Dermot Mulroney) and Bill (Jason Isaacs) are trying to get information out of Omar Abadi (Barkhad Abdi) at a black site. They are assisted by Visser (Annie Ilonzeh), and all three answer to Olsen (Mel Gibson), who is at the top of the command chain.
Omar is held for receiving a large amount of money ($2 million) for his resistance group, the Crescent Democratic Front, which aims to oust the dictator, Bandar El-Mizdawi. But it seems that this amount of money came from a group that only associates with terrorists.
The trio tries to get Omar to give in to the charges despite it being apparent that he has no prior information and is clean.
Bill is sure that Olsen is holding something back on Omar. He asks Harris to take the call on this situation since Olsen is pushing them to kill Omar on very flimsy evidence.
It is made clear that Bill and Visser have different motives and apply their own approaches to manipulating Omar. Visser brings in Omar's family to get him to confess, while Harris is the good cop. Bill believes that Omar is telling the truth.
Harris, Bill's partner-cum-friend for years, observes on a screen from a nearby room. Harris tells Bill that El-Mizdawi is helping the CIA against Al-Qaeda, and a week after the deal was made, Harris and the team got orders to pick up Omar.Omar is ultimately killed by Visser under the excuse of defending herself from being shot. What follows is the revelation that Visser has her own orders from Olsen, and they include killing Bill too. And so, she shoots him as well in the interrogation room. This whole thing is observed by Harris, who makes a run with the footage of the whole incident and escapes before Visser and two guards (formerly thought to be working for Harris and Bill) can get hold of him.Back in the present, we see three private agents on their way to capture a person. This is also on order from Olsen. Later, we see Kavinsky (Adan Canto), Miller (Katie Cassidy), and Reese (Rhys Coiro) bringing the person in via air. Also, Kavinsky has been receiving encrypted messages since they were putting the person on the plane. Later, it is revealed that the person is none other than Harris. Kavinsky searches the entire plane before boarding it.Kavinsky is an ex-marine, and had been rejected by the CIA 5 times, and he had been taking on private assignments in the meantime. Olsen had called Kavinsky for a meeting a few days ago and asked him to undertake a mission as a test for his readiness to join the CIA.
Olsen also met Miller, who had dropped out of college twice, and had beaten up her professor at Harvard Law School. Olsen recruits her for his mission.
Someone from CIA (Called Control and later revealed to be Visser) is in contact with Kavinsky via messages and tells him not to talk to the target, or to open the encrypted messages that he has been receiving on his phone.
In parallel, Control is in touch with Miller and tells her not let Kavinsky open the messages or talk to the target under any circumstances.Omar's interrogation, followed by Harris's capture, are both parts of Olsen's plan, which in turn is following orders from Langley (CIA headquarters). Omar is a sacrifice as a part of a deal struck between the CIA and El-Mizdawi (the very dictator that Omar and his organization intend to overthrow). El-Mizdawi would allow the CIA access to his resources to bring down Al-Qaeda (whom Mizdawi hates as well). In return, the CIA would have to stop those trying to overthrow him, e.g., Omar. Olsen is given the responsibility to handle the operation and, with loose ends never an option, he does all in his power to have a ""clean-up,"" i.e., kill everyone associated with this operation without a trace.The team panics when Kavinsky finds body bags inside the plane, the cockpit door locks, and the plane starts descending. It is obvious that the team is heading into a trap. Needing answers Kavinsky wants to talk to the target. Miller stops Kavinsky but agrees with his logic and they decide to look at the messages he has been receiving from his unknown source. The message has a video showing Visser killing someone on her own team.
All 3 team members say that Olsen told them that Visser would be running point on this Operation. Miller figures that the encrypted messages are coming from their target. The team agrees to now hear from their target, who is revealed to be Harris.Harris reveals that the team (bringing in Harris) would be intercepted by Visser after landing in Thailand, killed, and deemed KIA. But this doesn't happen as the team decides to work with Harris to foil Visser's plot. This video would prove Visser and her seniors guilty of killing a CIA operative. The senior in this case, is Olsen. Olsen, however, doesn't know anything about this footage.What follows is a gunfight between Visser and her men and Harris and the trio (Kavinsky, Miller, and Reese). Olsen had sent in a strike team to kill everyone, including Visser, but the team manages to fight them off. Visser realizes that she has been burned, when Olsen will not pick up her phone. In the ensuing firefight, Visser is killed by Harris.
Despite Olsen's best efforts to kill everyone at the location, including a drone strike (to eliminate the strike team sent in to kill Visser and the team), Harris makes it out alive along with Kavinsky and Miller. Reese isn't able to make it. But to Olsen, everyone is dead, and the secret is buried underground forever.Two weeks later, Olsen receives a video feed that shows Visser killing Bill, proof that he can compromise him to the CIA big-time. Realizing that he is being tracked, he looks around and recognizes a white van. Despite being shot at, the van and its occupants (Harris, Kavinsky, and Miller) escape unhurt. Olsen contacts a man and telling him, ""We have a problem.""",A CIA officer finds himself the target of a rendition operation after being scapegoated for the death of an interrogation subject.

Ellie immediately voices opposition from the beginning wishing to be back with her friends.The first night they are there, Kiera and Brian must go into the office for work, and leave Ellie to watch Steven, much to her dismay. Steven finds a secret room that contains older items, and has Ellie play the sonographe they found. It begins with a man reciting formulas and then counting up slowly. Ellie shuts it off before it reaches seven and tells Steven to go to bed.While Steven is sleeping and Ellie is watching TV, the power goes out and Ellie frantically calls her mother. Kiera has Ellie count up to 10, the number of the stairs down to the cellar where the breaker is located. Kiera notices that when Ellie gets to 10, she continues to count in a dreamlike manner. Brian and Kiera rush home to find Ellie missing and a search is sent out for her.The next day, unable to find Ellie the local police deem she has run away and will turn up in a few days, seeing as how she has a history of running away. Keira knows something is wrong and investigates herself.In the cellar she finds mysterious equations etched into the floor, and plant-based paint on the far wall in the forms of red haunted faces. After having the police look at it, they determine its from the 1950s and question who owned the house previously. Brian responds by saying they bought it for almost nothing at auction from an elderly woman.Later that night while Brian and Kiera are sleeping, Steven wakes Kiera up to tell her he has wet the bed. After helping and sending him back to bed, she hears whispering from the upstairs bathroom sink in the form of a girl counting up. As the counting continues she makes her way down to the cellar door. She opens the door and turns the light on before going down the steps to find nothing.The next day Kiera asks Brian what the different symbols above all the doors in the house mean. Kiera takes pictures of the symbols and goes into the office and has her coworker Erica find out what they mean. She tells her they are Hebrew glyphs that spell out ""Leviathen"", a sea creature of Jewish mythology.Later at the house Kiera plays the sonographe from earlier and Steven begins to count with it while walking towards the secret room. Kiera snaps him out of it. While researching the man in the portrait that hangs in the house, John Fetherston, the cellar door opens and the lights slowly go out. Steven calls for help from the cellar and Kiera goes to get him out of the closed Cellar, while looking through the keyhole she sees a monstrous eye only for Steven to ask her from behind who she's talking to as he's been asleep the whole time. The door opens slightly and the lights return. Kiera goes into the cellar, the lights off and the door swings shut. A growling is heard slowly ascending the steps after Kiera drops her phone down the stairs. She becomes frightened until Brian shows up and opens the door.Kiera tells Brian that something is down there, her phone disappeared and the people who used to own the house, the Fetherstons, all went missing except their daughter. Brian believes she's overreacting and goes down to look for her phone, finding animal hair instead, the phone gone.The next day Kiera goes to the National College of Mathematics to meet with Dr. Remi Fournet. She gives him the paper with the equation on it and he says it's ""Delta point vector sum epsilon partial I equals 1N DY by DX"", the same words from the sonographe. He tells her Fetherston was a colleague of Erwin Schroödinger at the college on a unity theory until his son became ill and then he completely disappeared. He tells her at first glance the equation is a representation of dimension(s) and is incredibly complicated. Kiera gets home with her new phone and Remi calls her asking if she's okay as he called and heard someone pick up who was counting. He then tells her a colleague of his stated the equation was created in the 12th century by alchemists, it was like an unfinished incantation. He also says there is a similar case of a house in Belgium with similar markings and everyone had disappeared as well.Brian gets upset with Kieras theories and so she takes him into the cellar to show him the symbols. While there, Steven walks toward the mysterious secret room. Brian tells Kiera she's being delusional and refuses to help her. He attempts to destroy the bottom step, unsuccessfully, and the sonographe turns on to count while Steven sees a cruel form of Ellie with symbols carved on her face and she counts in unison. Kiera and Brian run upstairs after he screams and Brian finds Ellies phone in the room.Kiera goes to visit Rose Fetherston at St Antonys private nursing home. Rose tells her it was her father who brought the dark entity into this world, to save her sick brother Jack. She tells Kiera it is Leviathen, one of the seven princes of hell who has gone by many names and is an ancient evil. She also tells her its not just the cellar, but the whole house.When Kiera gets home, Brian shows her the research he's done, that the shapes and symbols over the doors make a pentagon, which combined with Leviathen means ""Baphomet"", a goat-human with black wings, a demon worshipped by the occults Knight Templar. As they are talking, Steven follows his drone into the cellar as the sonographe plays. Baphomet appears and takes Steven as he reaches the bottom and the lights go out. They search for Steven with the lights out, the breaker not working, and find him in the secret room with a carving on his chest. Both he and Brian begin counting down from 48 and Kiera runs from Baphomet when they reach one, with the chase leading down the cellar stairs which are now very long leading to a lone door at the end.Kiera hides behind the door, and after Baphomet has gone, she continues walking down the passage way and finds what seems to be an endless crowd of people, all counting different numbers as they shuffle forward in a lifeless dimension. She finds Ellie after losing hope and brings her back, escaping Baphomet and yelling at him that he cannot take her family. She reunites with Brian and Steven.Together again she leads her family to the front door and opens it, revealing they never left the demons dimension and Ellie, Steven and Brian begin to count up turning away and walking into the cellar, and as the credits roll, Kiera joins in the counting. (thanks to Wikipedia)",Keira Woods' daughter mysteriously vanishes in the cellar of their new house. She soon discovers there is an ancient and powerful entity controlling their home that she will have to face or risk losing her family's souls forever.

Robert and his wife Maia have inherited her father's huge house, and they're moving in. Almost immediately, she goes to a secret compartment in the floor that contains a creepy doll. They go to the bar and talk to Judy the bartender. Everyone in town is happy to see Maia returned, and they all buy them drinks. Robert drinks way too much and passes out.Late that night, Robert hears crying coming from the attic. It's a very old blind woman. ""You're home,"" she says before roaring at him. Nope, just a nightmare. The couple talks about losing their baby in a miscarriage; she thinks he blames her for the loss.Robert finds a painting in the attic that looks exactly like him. She doesn't think it looks that much like him. The painting is titled ""The Visitor Accepts,"" and she has no idea where her father got the old painting. We see that Robert is on medication for his anxiety, and he's had trouble with it before.Robert goes to the hardware store, and the clerk says, ""We need to talk, Robert."" When another customer comes in, she ends up writing him a note. ""Art is a lie that makes us realize the truth."" The note mentions Delacroix Art & Antiques.Robert and Maia go to her father's memorial service, and the pastor gives a speech about his devastating absence.Everyone in town is way too friendly to Robert. He goes to the antique store the hardware lady indicated and finds a civil war-era painting there, again with his face. This one is titled ""The Visitor Watches it Burn."" The owner says the painting was there when she bought the store. The woman says he doesn't really want answers; ""You don't want answers- What you need is to run back to London as fast as your legs can carry you!""When he comes home, Maia has hung the first painting in their living room as a joke. He thinks the stress is getting to him. Meanwhile, over at the antique shop, the proprietor gets an unexpected visitor, a swarm of locusts that kill her.The next morning, Maia tells Robert that she's pregnant. Several months pass. The pastor has a talk with Robert about being a true believer, which Robert is not. ""You will be,"" the old man says. ""When you see for yourself, you won't be able to deny it."" The preacher has his own painting, ""The Visitor Stakes His Claim."" The preacher says the painting was of Alistair Edgar, the man who saved their town back in the day. Robert and Maia find a bunch of frogs in their living room when they get home.Robert gets a strange phone call from Maxwell Braun, another art dealer. He's been researching the Visitor paintings and photos as well; he's got one with Hitler and another with Saddam Hussein and Stalin. Robert, or the Visitor, has turned up in hundreds of photos and paintings ""corresponding to moments in history we wish we could forget."" Maxwell says it's not too late to go back to London; he hands Robert an envelope full of money. If he stays, he will become the Visitor.Robert is convinced. Maia goes berserk when he mentions going home to London. Robert gets a call from Maxwell to meet in the woods. When he gets there, Maxwell is dead and tied to a tree. He goes home looking for Maia and finds another picture of himself, but Maia says that this one is of her father. And, as it turns out, his father as well; Robert had been kidnapped as a baby. Maxwell and his friends sent Robert to London to grow up, hoping to break the cycle.Maia reveals to Robert that it's been him going out at night and killing people. He is a vessel for a greater power. This has been going on since Alistair sold his soul for the town in the 1700s. Even the miscarriage in London wasn't an accident - it was a girl and she needs to have a boy to continue the line of ""Roberts"". Robert passes out, and Maia says now he can be who he was always meant to be.We get a flashback of when Maia and Robert met in London, cut with Maia giving birth, ala ""Rosemary's Baby."" The whole town is there in robes and masks chanting as the baby is born. Robert, who is now The Visitor (again) takes the throne. Afterward, Maia is blind just like her mother. He drives through the town, jubilant as they all celebrate his return.","After a series of tragedies, Robert moves with his wife back to her childhood home. After he discovers an old portrait of a man who looks like him, he goes down a rabbit hole to discover the identity of this mysterious doppelganger."

She'd wanted a divorce from the misogynist, but he refused and her pill addiction prevented her from taking their young son Kevin. Now clean, she's teaching high school English and drama and needs Grace's support in her fight for full custody.As the sisters co-own the house, Kathleen asks to mortgage her half. And she vaguely mentions she's looking into other things. When pressed, Kathleen talks of blackmail.Homicide Detective Ed Jennings has a week off, so he's renovating his house, where he's Kathleen's next door neighbor. Ed and Grace meet and instantly connect. They meet up, she with the excuse of consulting with him for a story idea. Heading back next door to Kathleen's, Grace finds her lifeless body. Ed hurries over and helps the other police in the investigation, and lets Grace stay with him that night.After searching the house, they discover that Kathleen had been working as a dominatrix for the website Fantasy Inc. Collecting her things from the house the next day, Grace goes over the details she'd observed with Ed, and he likewise answers some of her questions. Detective Jennings and his partner Ben learn that Kathleen's performer name was Desiree and she had many clients. As the company is small and family-run, access to the performers' info is limited.Visiting Kathleen's school, a few students express their condolences to Grace. She collects her things, finding the papers she'd planned to use against her husband. Outside the school Jerald Baxter, son of a senator, asks Grace what she knows about Kathleen's death, but she doesn't say. He tells her he'd overheard janitor Billy Sachs upset her one day. Grace approaches Billy, and he admits he'd discovered Kathleen was Desiree at his cousin Richie's, the webcam technician for Fantasy Inc.Another performer is killed, the body laid out similarly to Desiree's. This body was discovered as she was killed during a recorded session, and her client had called 911. Now they consider it to be a serial killing.Grace approaches Jonathan, who insists he has a solid alibi. He also knew of her side job, and refers to her as a hooker, so she punches him. Grace tells him not to come to the funeral, but he disregards her. She confronts him there, and is observed by students. Jerald takes a moment by the casket. Reading the cards sent with the flowers, one is addressed to Desiree.Grace approaches Captain Rivera, showing her the card and offering her services for the investigation. Citing help she gave to the NYPD which ended a case they'd worked on for months solved three days after she'd joined them, she offers herself as an asset. After Grace makes a few concise observations, the captain takes her on as a consultant.Another performer is attacked, but this time she cuts the attacker, who gets away. She describes him as a tall white teen and his watch in detail. Returning to student Rand's house, they find a watch fitting the description, he has an injury on his arm and his size matches. He's taken in, but his blood type doesn't match. After Grace speaks to Billy again, he admits Rand and Richie are a couple, although he is still closeted.That night Grace and Ed act on their attraction. At the next morning's debriefing, after Ben reports Rand's legit alibis, Grace proposes baiting the killer by posing as Desiree. In the meantime, after wrestling practice Jerald beats Rand severely after he says he was obsessed with Kathleen.The MPDC shuts down Grace's sting operation as they have enough evidence on Jerald. While they are at the Baxters' to arrest him, having abandoned the sting operation, Grace faces him alone. She secretly leaves the computer on live feed and Jerald confesses to all, even a plot to kill his own mother. When Grace tells him his confession was recorded, the enraged teen goes ahead with trying to strangle her.

Unable to find any evidence, he orders his DEA men to track Cain wherever he is. Cain was shown escaping the house a few minutes before it blew up. He was pursued by armed assailants and his car was blown up.
Meanwhile, John Cain wakes up in a Mexican hospital without having any idea of who he is or how he got there. A woman by his side, Anna (Abbie Cornish), claims to be his wife. There is also a guy named Eddie (Omar Chaparro) who is supposed to be his friend. Eddie promises to help him bring his memory back. He then makes his way to the doctor, under whose care Cain is, and threatens to kill his family unless he brings back Cain's memory by any means necessary.Anna says that Cain was born on Dec 2nd, 1972, in Boulder Colorado.
With time, as Cain's memory comes back to him in bits and pieces, he finds that those around him aren't what they seem. Cain knows that Anna is not his wife. Cain realizes that every time he remembers something, the Doctor gives him a sedative. Cain attacks the doctor and tries to escape the hospital with Anna.
Eddie and his men attack Cain and force him to hide inside the hospital. Anna tells Cain that he is very close to Eddie and Eddie is a drug dealer. Eddie and Cain did all kinds of deals together. Cain believes that he is a drug dealer.
Cain doesn't believe Anna and ties her to a chair in the utilities area. Cain starts attacking Cain's men inside the hospital.The doctor finds Cain and takes him to a cabin. Cain finds out that they are looking for a case he had in his possession before he landed in the hospital. He stole it from General Mondejo, head of the army, someone to whom all the cartels report, and then went off-grid. And since he arrived at the hospital, Eddie has been trying to administer memory drugs to bring his memory back so that he can remember the location of the case. The Doctor was giving him B12 to counter the effects of the memory drugs. The doctor is helping Cain, as he has been terrorized by Eddie for many years.
Cain calls a number that he found inside his wallet. He is connected to McCoy. McCoy tells him that he is DEA and has been undercover in Eddie's organization for the last 5 years. Cain finds evidence of Eddie's drugs operation inside the hospital.
Cain returns to Anna. Anna tells him that he was recruited by the CIA. John Cain knows he is in a ""Blackout.""One of Eddie's men finds Cain. Cain learns that Montejo paid money $20 million for the case, but Cain double crossed him by taking the money and the case. Cain talks to Eddie.
Eddie tells Cain that he knew Cain was DEA (McCoy told Cain earlier that he was DEA), and they both decided to ""play"" DEA by stealing the case and bringing it to General Montejo.
Cain escapes from Eddie when his men open fire on him and meets Anna again inside the hospital. McCoy calls and says that the cavalry is on the way to rescue Cain.
Later on, it is Anna who confirms that John Cain is indeed DEA, but he was recruited by the CIA to recover the case. So, we do not really know what Cain intended to do with the case. Cain is confused about whether he is the good guy or the bad guy.Anna recovers the case from the doctor's chamber. We also find out that the doctor actually helped Cain by making him forget his memories so that the bad guys (Eddie and the others) couldn't kill him.
It is revealed that the case has ""the names and addresses of the Illuminati"" ... ""the puppeteers and the puppets..."" [that run the world]. McCoy turns out to be another bad guy trying to get his hands on the case.""It's about order,"" says Anna to Cain, addressing the importance of the case. Keeping in mind how information is power during present times, any one person with all that intel (that can ""destroy the government,"" according to Anna) can certainly become an international threat, compromising relations among nations and causing disorder and chaos. When Cain went off the grid, he compromised the order. Perhaps because he realized how dangerous it could be in the hands of the wrong person. It was Cain's good fortune that his doctor hid it somewhere where no one could find it unless they looked hard. Anna did.
Cain remembers that he was in a romantic relationship with Anna.Cain attacks the remainder of Eddie's men and kills them all, just as McCoy arrives with his troops. Cain gets into McCoy's car with Anna. Turns out McCoy is crooked as well and wants his own hands on the case. McCoy believes that Anna was working for him, but Anna ends up attacking all of McCoy's men.Anna and Cain run away with the case after killing all of McCoy's men. Cain shoots McCoy as well, but it's only a flesh wound. No single organization should have the case in its possession. Such things should be destroyed unless there is a place where they can be locked away until the time comes to bring them out again.","A man wakes in a hospital with no memory, and quickly finds himself on the run in a locked down hospital with the Cartel on his tail.

In this setup, the movie starts off.Next a series of news snippets are inter played as the media is shown portraying the 2019 protests by BLM and Antifa in a manner that satirizes the situation, juxtaposing actual scenes of arson against the news anchor's statements of peaceful protests. Two protesters are then shown discussing the suppression of information for ""the good of the people.""This morphs into the first scene of Hunter Biden, and one of his many parties that throw around cash, sex, and drugs. At the end of this first scene, with the revelers mostly asleep and strung out, there is a humorous presentation of a small dog, using dialog bubbles to tell Biden he's being used by freeloaders who don't really care about him. Agreeing with the dog, Biden orders everyone out of his apartment.We then see Hunter meet up with another recurring character in the movie, named Grace Anderson, who spends much of the movie as a combination of Hunter's girlfriend, savant, and moral conscience. Her first interactions show Hunter entering a drug purchase, followed by the first of many intimate conversations about their lives and troubles.Next enters Joe Biden into the movie, meeting with his son Hunter in the back of a Vice-Presidential motorcade, discussing the laptop that Hunter Biden abandoned at a computer repair store. They discuss how the laptop became the property of the store owner. They discuss how the FBI now has the laptop and how Joe Biden needs to know what's on the laptop so he can work to create cover stories in the media.This limo scene is interrupted by scenes of Grace meeting with one of Hunter's personal assistants. This assistant then works with Grace to try to find web articles to discuss what Hunter had previously told her took place. Being unable to find any information that matched what Hunter had told her took place, Grace is told she must find other websites to find the background information she seeks. Grace then consults those other websites and finds her corroborating information.The Secret Service agent then provides a brief summary of the convictions these Biden associates received, while describing some of their most significant criminal actions, as well as the financial details of the Hunter Biden business deals. This is when the movie first portrays Joe Biden telling an audience how he forced the resignation of a Ukrainian prosecutor, who was investigating Hunter, in return for a $1 billion loan guarantee by the Obama administration.The story then returns to the limo, where Hunter and Joe Biden end their conversation with the mention of removal of travel bans against Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs in return for Hunter no longer being prosecuted, along with revealing a smear campaign against the computer store owner by portraying him as a Russian agent.Following this, is another extended scene between Hunter Biden and Grace Anderson, where the two discuss the Peoples Republic of China. In this exchange, details of Hunter's business deals with Chinese business leaders are played out in character. It is during this scene where the apartment manager evicts Biden due to the salacious nature of his many parties. This extended scene concludes with Anderson speaking about Chinese human rights violations, as well as confronting Hunter on the true roots of his actions and self-destructive behavior.Hunter Biden's personal assistant then gives to Grace a recording of her many conversations with Hunter Biden, a recording she tries to give to a freelance journalist named Bob, who is working at the time for the Washington Post. This journalist is shown as refusing to accept the story and urging Grace to forget all about it. Grace then posts the information she has online, and is shown immediately suffering social media cancellation and attacks.The final scenes play out showing Rudy Giuliani accepting Grace's invitation to meet, releasing the recordings. The movie concludes by showing the aftermath of the public release of these conversations, prior to the 2020 election, that force the FBI to accelerate their criminal investigation of Hunter Biden, as well as force mainstream media to retract their previous denials of the laptop information. This culminates in a revisionist outcome of the 2020 election in which Donald Trump is re-elected by a wide margin, presumably due to the controversy created after the media reports the details of the Biden business deals and Hunter Biden's personal lifestyle, as well as other media reports of Hunter Biden being arrested by the FBI for various charges.These revisionist narratives are then stopped, showing a concluding scene of Grace refusing to release the recordings, and lamenting what could have been if she had done so. She reconciles with her estranged father in an embrace and final statement that perhaps, ""in the end, the truth itself has become the fairy tale.""The movie fades out with several real world media clips as well as actual video of Joe and Hunter Biden and their activities. These clips show 2020 efforts by mainstream media to castigate the New York Posts' laptop articles as being Russian disinformation, followed by reports they made in 2021 and 2022 that the laptop information is genuine.","Fictional retelling of the lifestyle and scandals of Hunter Biden, son of US President Joe Biden."

Her main profession is that of a burlesque dancer, but she wants to shift away from it, mostly because of her aging body and because she finds her passion in writing. Her neighbor's young boy, Sam, and his pet dog, Moses, are friendly with the woman, and it is with the boy that trouble begins. One day, while Gypsy is at work, she is called up by his neighbor, Ralph, who desperately asks for her help. Ralph had stolen a large sum of money from a local criminal, Jack, and the gangster had now sent men after him to kill him and his family. Jack and Gypsy, however, have a history together, as Ralph claims she is the only person Jack would listen to. As a panicky Ralph tries to drive away from danger with his wife and mother in the car, he calls up his son, instructing him to quickly come down to a certain spot along with his iPad, for all the necessary codes and information are stored on that device. Sam reaches the designated place on time, along with his dog, but his family is shot dead almost right in front of his eyes.Meanwhile, guessing that something terrible has happened, Gypsy drives back home and finds a weeping Sam hiding in her bathroom. Although not very keen on having to disrupt her own life to essentially babysit a kid and a dog, Gypsy cannot help but provide assistance to the boy, for she knows that he would be killed if Jack gets his hands on him. Quickly packing her bags, she takes Sam and Moses on her semi-truck and drives away from their neighborhood and town, to get as far as possible from her ruthless ex-lover.Gypsy's plan is to escort Sam to his uncle's place, who is a rabbi at a synagogue in a city some distance away. But the uncle does not seem to have been very connected with his brother, and although he agrees to take the child in, he asks for some time to prepare for such a sudden change in his life. Gypsy aggressively claims that the boy, too, did not get any time to prepare for such a massive change of fate and decides to hand the boy off at his uncle's place no matter what. On the way, she stops at a hotel and puts up with the boy there, and realizes that the boy is too chatty and attention-seeking for her solitary life. But she also realizes why Sam craves such love and affection, as he is, after all, a kid who has lost everyone he knew in life all of a sudden. His only companions now are his dog and his neighbor, who has been taking him away from trouble. He realizes what the trouble is, though, as Sam is an extremely intelligent and sharp kid who keeps mining and investing in cryptocurrency. But in his childhood arrogance, he often refuses to cooperate with Gypsy until apologizing and trying to get back to her good terms only a little while later.On the other hand, Gypsy has to constantly look out for the boy's and her own safety, as Jack's men have already been following her and even questioned her about her neighbor's boy, to which she lied. After some time, she realizes that it is best to use her old charms on Jack, and she visits him at his residence, claiming to hand over her neighbor's dog to him. Jack admits that she has always been the love of his life, despite having cheated on her multiple times while being together, and that he is still interested in her. Gypsy, however, knows better, and she denies any commitment to him and manages to bring the dog back alive. Despite trying to convince Jack to let the boy alone, though, she finds out that her ex-boyfriend has placed a tracker on her car, suspecting that she has the boy with her.They somehow manage to evade the gang men at the hotel's parking lot and then throw away the tracker on a different car, duping the men in the wrong direction. Gypsy then casually breaks into an unlocked car and steals it, only to put the men off her track. Sure enough, the men track her semi-truck down with the help of their police friends, and momentarily lose track of them. However, Gypsy and Sam shockingly realize that they are also accompanied by another woman who had been sleeping inside the car and claims it to be her own. Gypsy persuades this woman, Tasmin, to help them and drop them off at their location, and they continue to journey together. They gradually bond with Tasmin too, and take another stop, but have to rush out again as Gypsy realizes Jack has set off the police after her, claiming that Sam is a missing child. Tasmin helps them out of this situation in return for some money that Gypsy promises to give her once they get to their destination. That night, they reach Cascade, Montana, where Gypsy's close friend Lacey prepares a safe space for them. Leaving the boy and the dog back, Gypsy takes Tasmin to the local graveyard, where she digs up an empty grave, which actually contains a bag full of money that Jack had saved up for her when they were together. However, Jack also remembers this spot and confronts them here, making Tasmin flee the scene. Gypsy manages to survive the night by hiding inside a concrete casket, and Lacey gives Sam and Moses company on the other side. The next morning, they meet up at a predetermined spot, and Gypsy and Sam now drive forward towards Sam's uncle, leaving Moses behind with Lacey.Along with the progressing plot, ""9 Bullets"" tries to build up the gradual relationship of friendliness and possible kinship between solitary Gypsy and young Sam. The woman, who is often irritated by the boy's actions and her decision to keep him tagging along, also finds company in the boy. The boy seems mentally more mature than his physical age, and despite his childly perceptions, he realizes that nobody really wants him and that Gypsy is the only one who cares about him even a small bit. Gradually, Gypsy opens up to him about her own past-she had been forced upon by a college professor, the result of which was a son that she decided to keep and raise as her own. But the child soon died tragically in a car accident, for which Gypsy still holds herself responsible, and she admits that she is not good around children because they remind her of her own child and her failure. Though such emotions are brought in, they remain restricted only to the point of being stated rather than being felt. The film overall lacks the chemistry and emotiveness that were required to make it convincing.Jack and his men track down Tasmin to interrogate her about Gypsy's location, and she fearfully tells them of Lacey's house. One of the men possibly spares Tasmin's life, as she weeps that she has been returning home to her estranged mother, and then they go over to Lacey's. They are not accompanied by Jack, though, who is seen returning to his current lover, Lisa, a young, influential woman who wants Jack to get into politics. Lacey has a very aggressive reaction to the men, as she was prepared for such a visit, and shoots dead one of the men with her lethal shotgun. On the other hand, Gypsy advises Sam to return to Jack all the money that his father had stolen, for there is no end to running away from crime. She calls up Jack, asking him again to spare the child once he returns the money, and Sam does so shortly after. He and Gypsy then reach the rabbi's synagogue, where they enter and listen to a sermon about repentance. This convinces Gypsy to not leave the child behind and instead take him along with her and keep him as a part of her life.As the two happily exit the building, though, they are tracked down by two of Jack's men, who have been promised even more money to kill Gypsy by Lisa. They manage to shoot Gypsy down, with the final shot fired by Lisa herself, who kills the woman out of jealousy. But Gypsy manages to shoot the two men dead before dying, and keeps Sam out of trouble as Lisa has no intention of killing him. The boy is shocked by the whole scene and desperately cries for help. Despite having been shot five times from point-blank range, Gypsy wakes up in the hospital a few weeks later, perhaps out of her sheer insistence from the very beginning that it would take nine bullets to kill her, as she is like a cat with nine lives. Sam joyfully welcomes her back to consciousness, and he has even identified himself as the woman's son to the doctors. Sam also reveals that he had placed a virus in the code while sending the money over to Jack, which made Jack unknowingly donate all the money to the Save the Children foundation.

Ralphie has been taking the year off from his job to write his first novel, but its excessive length leads multiple publishers to reject it. Mrs. Parker (Julie Haggerty) calls to tell Ralphie that his dad, ""the Old Man"" (played by the late Darren McGavin), has died, and the grief-stricken family makes its way to Hohman, Indiana, to be with her. She gives Ralphie two tasks: write his father's obituary and take up his mantle of making Christmas special for the family.Ralphie's children befriend one of the Bumpus kids next door and are bullied by two children on a snowmobile. Ralphie reunites with Flick (Scott Schwartz), who now owns his father's old tavern, and Schwartz (RD Robb), who still lives with his mother and has run up a large tab at Flick's. While leaving the house to go ice skating, Sandy falls, slips on ice and sprains her ankle.As Christmas Eve approaches, the family goes to Higbee's, where Ralphie miraculously buys everything Mark and Julie asked for while their children wait in line to see Santa. On the way back, Ralphie's car breaks down again and Ralphie accidentally injures Julie in the eye during an impromptu snowball fight, which requires a trip to the emergency room and a temporary eye-patch. All of the gifts are stolen from the car's popped trunk when the family is inside the hospital, and Sandy has little money left to replace them.Back at Flick's, Flick offers to forgive Schwartz's tab if he completes a physical stunt, the ""Ramp"". Schwartz succeeds and his tab is forgiven, but afterwards Mark breaks his arm sledding and Ralphie is rejected by his final prospective publisher. After some comfort from Sandy and remembering the Christmases of yesteryear, Ralphie suddenly gains a burst of inspiration and writes a piece that far exceeds the length of a normal obituary. However, he leaves it on the desk, needing to prepare for Christmas Day. Mark and Julie manage to get back at their bullies by building a snowman over a tree stump so that their snowmobile crashes.That night, though, Julie becomes upset after the tree's star falls and breaks. Ralphie, frustrated, goes out against his wife and mother's urging to find a new one. Because all of the stores are closed, Ralphie breaks into Flick's tavern to ""borrow"" the star from the tree. On his way out, he is caught and apprehended by Scut Farkus (Zack Ward), now a Hohman police officer. Ralphie is terrified at what Scut will do to him, but Scut brings him home, saying he owes Ralphie because their fight set him on a better path in life.On Christmas morning, Ralphie is confused by compliments he receives about his piece in the newspaper. Sandy reveals she found the obituary manuscript and took it to the local paper, and its high quality led to it quickly being syndicated. Ralphie is offered a new job as a syndicated columnist, fulfilling his dream of leaving the rat race and becoming a full-time writer. Opening presents, it is discovered that the Old Man had bought and personally wrapped very thoughtful gifts for the family shortly before his death. Much of the town soon comes to the Parker house for Christmas dinner along with Randy (Ian Petrella). After dinner concludes, the core family asks Ralphie to read his story about the Old Man. Ralphie takes a seat and begins to read, fully embracing his new role as the Old Man's successor as his narration of it transitions into Jean Shepherd's from the original film.","Follows the now-adult Ralphie as he returns to the house on Cleveland Street to give his kids a magical Christmas like the one he had as a child, reconnecting with childhood friends, and reconciling the passing of his Old Man."

He and his mother Dela (Golshifteh Farahani) owned a candy shop in a small town, but were soon forced to close down and move away when the people of the town moved away. They move to a faraway city where they plan to open a new shop, but they eventually lose all the money they save up while getting by. Dela struggles to find work in the city and is barely able to afford her weekly rent payments to Mrs. McClaren (Rita Moreno).Elmer soon befriends a cat (Whoopi Goldberg) and eventually gets the idea to panhandle the money needed for the store, only for his mother to tell him that it is a lost cause. Angered, Elmer runs to the docks to be alone. The Cat comes to him and begins speaking to him, much to his shock. She tells him that on an island, Wild Island, beyond the city lies a dragon that can probably help him. Elmer takes the task and is transported to the island thanks to a bubbly whale named Soda (Judy Greer). Once they make it to Wild Island, Soda explains that a gorilla named Saiwa (Ian McShane) is using the dragon to keep the island from sinking, but it remains ineffective. The Island continues to sink and needs more and more frequent effort from Boris to pull it back up from the ocean.Elmer frees the dragon, a goof ball named Boris (Gaten Matarazzo), and they go on an adventure in search of a tortoise named Aratuah to find out how Boris can keep the island from sinking for the next century. Boris explains that his kind has been saving the island as long as anyone can remember, and after he succeeds, he will be an ""After Dragon"". Dragons have been coming to wild island forever as a rite of passage. when Dragons are 10 yrs old (100 in human yrs), they come to the island and save it from sinking (coz the island sinks every 100 yrs), and this turns them into a After Dragon, more muscular, fire breathing and basically awesome. Boris knows that the way he is saving the Island is not the right way, as he hasn't turned into the After Dragon yet. Boris has no idea how to save the Island the right way, and believes that Aratuah would know since he was around when the last dragon Horatio came to save it.During this conversation, it is discovered that Boris cannot fly due to breaking his wing when Elmer saved him (They were chased by Saiwa's 2nd in command Kwan who threw a fire torch at them and ended up hitting Boris's wing, injuring him), and he reveals that he is afraid of both water and fire. The two make an agreement that Boris will help Elmer raise enough cash to buy a new store and will let the dragon go free once finished. Along the way, they encounter some of the islands inhabitants, like Cornelius the crocodile (Alan Cumming), the tiger siblings Sasha (Leighton Meester) and George (Spence Moore II) (The tigers want to eat Elmer, as he is soft and sweet. He only escapes by making them fight over a cinnamon flavored bubble gum) and a mother rhino named Iris (Dianne Wiest) (she fell into a trap with her baby rhino and wasn't able to climb out. Elmer fell into the same trap) all while trying to evade Saiwa and his monkey army. Elmer explains to Iris that he is taking Boris to Aratuah to find out how to save the Island for real. When Saiwa arrives, Iris helps hide Boris and Elmer and tells Saiwa that they went towards the summit if the Island.
As Boris and Elmer make their way to Aratuah, the island continues to sink gradually. Kwan almost captures Boris, but Saiwa makes him let go, as he wants Kwan to save the monkeys from the incoming sea. Saiwa tells Kwan that one day he will lead the monkeys, and he has to learn to not abandon them, ever. They still have time to capture the dragon and save the island.They soon make it to Aratuah's shell, but Elmer finds out that he died, and leave as the island continues to sink. While resting on a flower, they are found by Saiwa and his forces. When Boris tries to escapes, Saiwa captures him by his injured wing, fixing it inadvertently in the process. Boris flies away with Elmer. Saiwa reveals that he knew about Aratuah's death, which angers his macaque 2nd-in-command Kwan (Chris O'Dowd), who proceeds to use a giant mushroom as a raft to leave the island, convinced that it is hopeless to save. While flying with Boris, Elmer has an epiphany; it is the roots below the island that pull it down. He manages to convince Boris to fly with all his might and while Boris manages to free the island from two of the roots, he then realizes that this is still the wrong way to save the island. He knows he has to jump into the summit fire to save it. But Elmer is not convinced and keeps telling him not to. Boris pushes Elmer off, who falls off the Island and into the water.Elmer is saved by Saiwa, who reveals that he and the other animals are evacuating the island and berates Elmer for wanting to use Boris for his own merits. He then reveals that once he found out about Aratuah's death, he was frightened about making everyone more worried and was even more worried when Boris showed up to save the island but Saiwa was weary of his goofy personality, so he lied and said he knew how to control Boris. Wanting to fix things, Elmer goes back to the island where Boris tells him he has found a way to save it by jumping into the fire at the summit of the Island and eventually after a lot of encouragement from Elmer he jumps in, he bursts out and magically lifts the island from the sea, finally becoming an After Dragon.After telling the animals of the island how to always let future dragons know the right way to save it, Boris takes Elmer home, passing by a surprised Kwan residing over on tangerine trees. Elmer reunites with his mother and the film ends with him embracing his new life in the city with his daughter narrating the end of the story.",Elmer Elevator searches for a captive Dragon on Wild Island and finds much more than he could ever have anticipated.

Her problems start when her daughter gives the finger to two racist rednecks. These thugs confront Brenda when she and her family get further down the road, and she is forced to humiliate herself in front of them. Bigger problems arise during their stay in a motel when they hear noises coming from next door. After hearing a gunshot, Brenda and Reggie investigate and find a dying man slumped against the wall. While Brenda tries to save him, Reggie foolishly decides to take a bag of cash that he finds in the bathroom.The money is originally in the hands of a drugs cartel, and this is later passed to two men who work for the mysterious Mr. Cross. One of these men, Harvey Ruck (Jesse Luken), betrays his partner Ochoa (Efrain Villa), kills him, and flees with the cash. He hides out in a motel, and this is where Brenda and Reggie find him.
Unfortunately, they don't find Harvey alive and well and living life to the full in his motel room. After booking a stay in the room next door to Harvey, the family hear a gunshot from the man's room. When Brenda and Reggie investigate, they find his dying body. As she is a certified nurse, Brenda desperately tries to save his life and she asks Reggie to get towels from a bathroom. When looking in a cupboard for the towels, Reggie also finds the money.Unbeknownst to Brenda, Reggie takes the money, not for selfish gain but because he thinks it will help his family. Unfortunately, his actions do his family more harm than good.
After giving their statements to the police, the family continue on their journey. Brenda then receives two phone calls. One call is from Arizona state trooper Captain J.D. Hammers (Beau Bridges) asking her to return to the motel and another is from a stranger who demands that she give back the money.
After speaking to the stranger, she realizes what Reggie has done. While initially unwilling to break up her journey and return to the motel, she finally decides she needs to in order to return the stolen money.After placing the bag in another motel room, she leaves a key under the doormat and calls the stranger to let them know the money has been returned.
While enjoying a day out with her family at a Wild West-themed Park, Cam decides he needs to use the washroom. Meanwhile, Brenda receives another call from the stranger. The person on the phone tells her that Cam has been abducted from the washroom by Mr. Cross and that if she wants to see him again, she has to deliver the money to a specific location.Leaving Kelly with Reggie, Brenda returns to the motel but when she gets to the room where the money was placed, she discovers the bag of cash has gone.
When Brenda returned the money, she was sighted by one of the motel's staff members. After a brief moment of panic, she sees the female employee with the bag. Brenda gives chase and follows the girl to a trailer park. While here, Brenda is confronted by a group of white extremists. She is then knocked unconscious by the girl.
When she wakes up, she tackles her captors and demands the release of the money they have taken. They don't take her seriously at first but when she tells them it belongs to Mr. Cross, they tremble at the name and give the money back to her.Meanwhile, Reggie and Cam meet with Captain Hammers. Kelly lets him know what has happened to Cam and she and Reggie then journey with Hammers to his ranch, which is supposed to be a place of safety for them while he carries out his investigation into Cam's disappearance.
Hammers introduces the two of them to his wife, a woman who looks warm and hospitable. Unfortunately, she is anything but. It turns out that Hammers is Mr. Cross, his wife is his accomplice, and they are the people responsible for Cam's kidnapping.
Reggie, Kelly, and Cam get locked inside Hammer's basement. While there, the corrupt Captain calls Brenda and demands that she brings the money to him.The captured trio manage to escape and when Hammers tries to stop them, they throw bleach in his eyes. They then overpower his wife and lock her and Hammers in the basement.
At this point, Brenda arrives and is elated to see that her family are safe. She leaves the bag of money on the driveway and leaves with her family.But before they can get far, Hammers and his wife escape from the basement and come after them. A car chase ensues, resulting in Brenda falling out of the car that Reggie is driving.
It looks like the end is nigh for Brenda when Hammers and his wife try to run her down but when she throws a road flare into their car, she survives while the two crooks perish in the burning car.
While sitting in a diner, light-fingered Reggie reveals that he took some of the money from the bag to help the family get a fresh start.Brenda is not happy about this news, and she tells her family that they need to give it back. There is just one problem: they don't know to who the money originally belonged! Reluctantly, Brenda decides to keep the cash when she realizes there is nobody to hand it to.
The movie ends with them enjoying breakfast, presumably helping themselves to a second helping with the money that Reggie has secured for them!","In this high-octane action thriller, a cross-country road trip becomes a highway to hell for Brenda and her family. Alone in the New Mexico desert, they have to fight for their lives when they become the targets of a mysterious killer."

Other students include Randall and Steven, two bullied loners who harbor crushes on Tamra and Ever; Danny, a jock; Hunt, Danny's best friend; Jacey, Danny's girlfriend; overweight outcast Ryan; and nerdy girl Candice. A sudden burst of blood on the windshield causes the driver, Wayne, to crash the bus in a forest. An emergency radio broadcast warns of a nearby chemical attack. A metalhead who appears to be a mutated zombie, later revealed to be a vengeful burnout named Chip, enters the bus and savagely mauls Lorenzo. In the ensuing commotion, Ever, Tamra, Randall, Steven, Danny, Hunt, and Jacey escape into the woods and seek safety in an abandoned building. Ryan joins them later. Meanwhile, Chip attacks Candice and others back on the bus.Ever attempts to help Candice when she tries to join everyone in the building, but the other students deem rescuing her too risky, so they let Chip attack Candice again. Wayne, having seemingly mutated into a zombie like Chip, attacks everyone inside. Classmates who were also apparently transformed capture Hunt. Ever, Tamra, Randall, Steven, Danny, Jacey, and Ryan regroup in a room where they find mannequins dressed to resemble them, realizing someone has specifically targeted all of them. Wayne suddenly attacks again, but Randall beats him. Danny begins transforming after being stabbed with something during the commotion. Wayne rises to tackle Danny through a window onto the ground outside. Initially appearing dead, Danny surprisingly contorts and runs off.Ever leaves Tamra behind after they argue about Tamra ignoring their friendship in favor of aligning with the ""jocks"". Ever and Steven return to the bus to look for a phone, although Ever becomes distracted by the radio, discovering that the emergency broadcast was actually a tape recording. Steven apologetically injects Ever from behind with a syringe. Before passing out, Ever sees Randall join Steven. A flashback shows that weeks earlier, Randall enlisted Steven for a scheme modeled after ""Scared Straight!"" where they would stage a zombie attack to get revenge on their bullies while looking like heroes to Tamra and Ever. Wayne volunteers, while ex-con and former student, Chip creates a dangerous drug to make people behave like zombies. Back in the present, Randall brings Steven back to the building to check on the students they injected and took captive, including Danny and Hunt. Meanwhile, Ever gathers enough strength to use a boom box to beat Chip.Tamra finds Randall, who lies that zombies killed Ever. After Steven secretly injects the captive students with more of Chip's drug, Randall arms Tamra, Ryan, and Jacey with weapons as he rallies them to kill their supposedly transformed classmates. Ever suddenly interrupts to tell everyone the truth about Randall and Steven's plot. Tamra hits Randall, who inadvertently reveals a vanity mural he previously painted that depicts him and Steven as mythic heroes saving Tamra and Ever from zombified bullies. With the secret now fully exposed, Ever's allies rescue Danny and lock Steven in a cage with Hunt and the other ravenous ""zombies"". Everyone then fights with Randall, who gravely wounds Danny, as Ever uses a makeshift Freddy Krueger glove, that Chip created, to stab Randall with several syringes of the drug. Randall reforms as a ""zombie"". Tamra, Jacey, Candice, and another rescued young woman team up to take Randall down, with Ever finishing him off.Hours later, Wayne, Chip, Randall, and Steven are all taken captive.

After screaming at her mother, she misses the bus and hitchhikes to school like it is no big deal.Abby has her crew of friends at school and isn't bothered by the mean popular girls. She does seem to have a problem catching the school bus and misses her ride home. Abby walks home and gets into a car with a stranger who gives her a ride but passes her street. Then he locks the doors and pulls a gun on Abby while threatening her. The man destroys her phone and tazes her, screaming at Abby to obey him.They drive deep into the woods, and the man drags her into his house, duct tapes her eyes, and zip ties her hands. He ties her to the bed with restraints, and she prays for God to help her. The man tells Abby that he served in the army and is good with guns. He says if she ever tells anyone what happened to her or tries to get away, he will have a militia kill her family.Abby's mother, Zenya, is worried when her daughter doesn't come home from school. She drives around town, searching the streets for her daughter. She comes across a police officer who puts a call out for a missing child. Then she drinks wine with her friend laughing about how she is probably just overreacting. She isn't and files an official report. News reporters start circling, and the search for Abby is on.The man watches the news about Abby on TV and wears a mask when he talks to Abby. To keep him from raping her, she listens to him and keeps him talking to earn his trust. It doesn't work because he puts a shot collar on her. Then he shows her news clippings about her kidnapping.Thirty-two days later, Abby is still in captivity. She asks the man his name because she wants to be his friend. He tells her to tell him what his name is; she says Felix because it sounds like someone smart and nice. (Which is a move that probably kept her alive, winning him over with subtle ego boots.)At work, the man is reprimanded for being a 9/11 denier/flat earther/annoying asshole. He continues to see missing posters for Abby and realizes he needs to call off the search. The man has Abby write a letter saying she ran away. She indents help on the letter and almost gets away with it.The punishment for trying to get help is more shocks on her neck and body. Then he locks her into a closet and has Abby rewrite the letter.Zenya receives the letter and is upset that the police/FBI are not moving faster on the case. The letter leaks to the press, and people who helped with the search harass Zenya for wasting their time.The shed finally comes into play; the man created a soundproof shipping crate with some books and a security camera for Abby to live in. She acts appreciative of his ""thoughtfulness. ""77 Days missing, Zenya is losing hope and starting to doubt that her daughter is even really alive. She finds solace in religion.For Christmas, the man gives Abby a cookbook; as she flips through the pages, Abby sees the name ""N Kibby."" Later, he gifts Abby a chess set. As they play, Abby tells him that she wants to be a hairdresser and asks him about his job and aspirations. She convinces him to take off the mask, and he relaxes his rules and lets her stay in his house.The man and Abby have an uncomfortable romcom moment that includes a flour fight while cooking, like a Hallmark movie. The man spins her around while dancing; Abby keeps her eyes on the exits and locks on the doors. At night Abby dreams of escaping, but the man shoots her before she can get away.While out in the world, the man gets into a fender bender with a litigious woman named Dottie. He gets some unwanted police attention and has to turn over his guns due to the assault charges against him. The police come to his house to collect and ask questions about the shed but don't find Abby.To reward Abby for not creating a scene with the police, he takes her to pet horses and promises to explain more about why he kidnapped her once people stop looking for her.Abby asks ""Felix"" to pick a flower for her. While he is outside, she steals a knife and tucks it away for safekeeping.The man gets fired from his job and forces Abby to help him counterfeit money.

Most people think that she is a runaway and has stopped looking for the teenager, but she needs help more than ever.Nate has become unhinged and realizes that he has to kill Abby. He cries to her and apologizes for what he has to do. Abby continues to outsmart her abductor and tells him that he is just misunderstood. Abby begs him to leave her body someplace where it can be found so her parents know what happened to her. After that, Nate just lets her go.Abby walks home and just says, ""hello."" Zenya can't believe that her daughter has just walked back into her life. They embrace while sobbing tears of joy.Nate Kibby is arrested and sentenced to 45 years in prison.In a voice-over, Abby says that the only way she survived was God, her family's love, and getting Nate to see her as a person rather than an object.

An extended outage where there's no electricity for the entire nation could kill up to 90% of Americas' population. This estimate came from the highly credentialed EMP Commission which operated at the behest of the US Congress for more than seventeen years.The film begins with Dennis Quaid saying he believes in this project and how the film will eventually get to a happy ending. Legendary comedian George Carlin, lays out how the nation is 'SoL' and 'JwF'd' if the power goes out for an extended period of time. It is explained how there's a major difference between a shorter term outage and a longer term 'Grid Down' scenario that could kill up to 90% of the country's population. The 2021 short term power outage in Texas is explained with note that the state's grid was 4.37 minutes away from a potential extended state-wide blackout.Then, the 'Power Grid' is explained. There are more than 3000 companies involved with the Grid, both public and private. There are three elements to the grid: 1) Generation. 2) Transmission 3) Distribution. There are three distinct grids in the US: 1) Eastern grid 2) Western grid. 3) Texas grid. The backbone and critical infrastructure of the grid is the power substation, which includes transformers. If multiple transformers become inoperable, the entire grid can go 'down' for an extended period of time. These transformers are massive and are manufactured overseas and require long lead times for replacement. A major vulnerability is the fact that many transformers have been manufactured in China.The major four threat vectors covered include:
1) Physical attack
2) Cyber attack
3) Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) attack
4) Geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) , otherwise known as Coronal Mass Ejection
These four threats are covered in some detail. For the (1) Physical attack threat vector, a 2021 60 Minutes segment was mentioned whereby a FERC study was mentioned whereby less than twenty substations being taken down could create a 'coast to coast' blackout.It explains how the major electrical providers are regulated and how there's essentially been 'regulatory capture' of the industry. Each party wants to claim that grid protection isn't their specific responsibility, it belongs to someone else. It's explained how there is protective equipment available that can protect our transformers and substations from attack, both from adversaries or from the sun. Several utilities are mentioned that are giving much further than most in seeking better protection of their infrastructure. Viewers are informed that this entire vulnerability can be fixed if regulators and legislators take action and they do their job, so they must hold these officials accountable by contacting them immediately by utilizing 'action tools' available on the website. Several local initiatives are mentioned that are having some success and viewers are urged to contact their local officials as well as state and federal officials.
The viewers are called on to take action now and the film ends with a patriotic review of history exemplifying how we can fix this horrific problem.","The film outlines the risk and consequences of the US power grid going down, leaving the nation without electricity for an extended period of time. It is explained how we became this vulnerable, and how we can resolve it going forward."

Those suffering from the curse experience nightmares, murderous impulses, and visions of Lizzie, who urges them to commit murder. Fearful and depressed, Tara's only solace is her hobby of redesigning vintage clothing, which her mother Emily sells for her online.When several townspeople are discovered murdered the police are quick to suspect Tara as all of the victims had issues with her and the murderer was seen wearing one of Tara's dresses. Seeking answers, Tara goes to visit her aunt Diane, who was institutionalized for the murder of her infant child. During the meeting Diane claims that Emily experienced the same curse, implying that Emily may be the murderer.Left with more questions than answers, Tara decides to visit Borden House with her boyfriend Carl. While at the house Tara learns that Lizzie was an excellent seamstress, causing her to wonder if the dresses are a trigger. Intrigued, Tara sends Suzy to her house to fetch some dresses. When the girl does not return or respond to calls, Tara and Carl travel to Tara's home, where she learns that her aunt has escaped from the mental institution. She also learns that her mother is the true killer and that Emily had also killed Diane's baby, as she believed it to be the product of incest between Diane and their father. In a psychotic rage Emily sympathizes with Lizzie Borden, who she believes killed her parents due to her mother's suspected infidelity. Emily then turns to slaughter Tara, but before she can do so, Emily is shot down by the police, as Tara's brother Caleb had called for help. The film ends with one of Tara's brothers talking to the spirit of Lizzie Borden, implying that he is a victim of the same curse.

Now, out of the army, he has been abandoned by the system. He's an impoverished man with a young daughter who has a serious medical condition for which he cannot afford treatment. Hence, he has chosen a life of crime to make ends meet. Following a drug bust, he is arrested and is looking forward to a 10-year prison sentence.This is when the police commissioner of the city in which he was caught gives him a lifeline. A corporate-backed, private prison, Degnan Correctional Facility, has been on the commissioner's watch because of its shady nature and the clandestine dealings in the place. The Warden there is a highly powerful man who runs the place with impunity, aided by guards who are all ex-military. If Terry goes into Degnan as an inmate, working undercover for the Commissioner to bring him proof of corruption and human rights violations inside the place, he won't have to serve his sentence. Terry agrees, knowing that to be a better solution than anything else at hand.Degnan is a quintessential 'hellhole'. The guards are brutal, inmates divide themselves into gangs, there are inter-gang rivalries and no new inmate is safe from getting hazed. Terry is secretly provided with a cellphone by the Commissioner, accessible only by him and through which he is to contact him and send him proof of what goes on inside. Terry is a lone wolf who refuses to join any gang. One day, he's attacked by members of an Aryan Brotherhood in the prison where he manages to fend them off with help from a stranger. Following a stay in solitary confinement, Degnan is informed about 'The Dungeon' and that the Warden wants him to participate in it.The Dungeon is an underground fighting ring where prisoners are made to fight against each other. It's a brainchild of the Warden who admits to having created it for entertaining himself in his otherwise dull job. There are no rules and fighters can get as ruthless as they wish in their matches. A good fighter in The Dungeon gains respect. The best fighter gets the title of the 'top dog', who is untouchable by inmates and guards alike.The top dog is also a close associate of the Warden. When Terry first arrives in Degnan, it is Freeway who is the reigning top dog. In the case of Freeway, he maintains law and order amongst the rest of the inmates through his gang and in turn is exempt from the penalties the other inmates are subjected to when they transgress. To train Terry for fighting in The Dungeon, the stranger who helped him, Bones, volunteers. Bones is the son of a martial arts grandmaster and learned how to fight from his father himself. He also trained Freeway in the past and wants to help Terry because he reminds him of a young man he once knew.The Dungeon itself is a completely illicit activity that is run under the Warden's watch. As it turns out, the other prisons that are run by the same private organization as Degnan, have their own fighting competitions similar to The Dungeon. This in turn has created a gambling network as the top dogs of these prisons fight against each other for large wagers and the winning fighter's Warden gets to keep that money.Along with The Dungeon, the Warden is also running a narcotics business, dealing in marijuana, cocaine, and PEDs. The workshop where it's packed and sent out from is worked entirely by prisoners of Degnan, made to labor there for free. After Terry becomes the top dog, he is given the offer to get a share in the profits from this business, the first time for someone in his position.In the drug bust that got Terry arrested, he took down multiple members of a gang with his bare hands. It's established then and there that Terry is an exceptionally strong fighter. When we find out that the Commissioner and the Warden are friends and that Terry was never really working undercover, the conspiracy behind his term at Degnan is laid open.Terry was never sent there as a mole by the Commissioner but to establish himself as the top dog in The Dungeon. The Commissioner had full faith in Terry's abilities and even placed a bet with the Warden that he would become their best fighter. With Terry as their top dog, they can put him in matches against other top fighters from different prisons in their network and make a lot of money from the winnings. Terry was never going to get a pardon and his movement up the ladder in The Dungeon cemented the indefinite period of his stay at Degnan.Terry plans a coup with other inmates and uses those who work in the narcotics workshop to record the activities there, which isn't shown onscreen. Before the coup's execution on the day he is to fight against the Aurora Correctional Facility's top dog, he hands over the memory card with incriminating evidence against the Warden and the Commissioner to Janette Johnson. She uses it to get the authorities involved and the DEA comes into the mix because of the narcotics ring that is being operated out of Degnan. When the inmates revolt during Terry's fight, DEA officers in riot gear arrive at just the right moment to catch not one, but two wardens from a connected network of prisons, presiding over an illegal fighting contest.The Warden and the Commissioner get arrested and Terry's evidence gets him a full pardon from his prison sentence. The medical costs of his daughter's treatment are taken up by the State as well, meaning he will not have to return to a life of crime.The excesses of the Warden of Degnan and what went on inside make a case for Congress to intervene in the functioning of privately-owned prisons and regulate their activities. Terry gets released from prison, walks out as a hero, and reunites with his daughter. He keeps his promise to Bones and Freeway by sending Janette as their lawyer to get them out of prison.

After saving Sugar's life, Mason shoots him with a fake bullet, thereby giving him another fake death in order to create a new cover for him so that he can easily leave the state. As soon as the film sets the premise, it quickly introduces the major conflict, which involves a woman named Rina Kimura, who is gathering evidence against a crime lord named Kosta.The FBI had planted Robyn Nhi (Rina) in the inner circle of Kosta Kimura to gather evidence against the criminal Syndicate for which he was working. The film quickly establishes that Kosta has married Rina, though he uses his wife to physically please his potential investors so that they will hand him the money without going too much into the details. Kosta has arranged a party to get some investors for a new project, and the FBI, hiding inside a van parked outside Kosta's villa, instructs Rina to use the distraction in their favor. The government authorities want some confidential information on Kosta; therefore, Rina walks into Kosta's office and opens his safe in order to transfer the files. However, at this point, she intentionally drops her hidden camera given to her by the FBI and quickly takes out an electronic wallet and some codes from two different shelves. She quickly closes the safe and tries to sneak away when Kosta confronts her and tries to assault her. Rina kicks Kosta out of the window, which leads to his sudden death. Kosta's associate, Marco Sari, who is in love with Rina, tries to stop her, but she runs away and sits in the FBI van, suggesting to Marco that she has been working for the FBI for a long time.Earlier, the Marshalls had promised Rina that they would give her a new identity and a new passport to leave the country in exchange for gathering evidence against Kosta and his Syndicate. But after Kosta's death, they changed their conditions and now want Rina to testify at trial, which means she cannot have her passport and her freedom until she fulfills their demands. The head of the department, Keisha Rhodes, suggests Rina take federal protection until the trial and assigns deputy Mason Pollard to her for the same. However, Rina refuses to become a prisoner of the state and walks out of the office.In the meantime, Marco, who replaces Kosta, swears to take revenge on Rina for tricking them both and killing one of his own. The Syndicate has also instructed Marco to recover ""the cold wallet"" that Rina had stolen from Kosta's safe, as the wallet holds some very crucial information. Later that night, Marco assembles a team of masked assassins and raids Rina's attorney's house, where Rina is hiding. Fortunately, Mason, who had been keeping an eye on the apartment, quickly arrived at the scene and helped Rina fake her death in order to escape Marco and his men. After rescuing Rina, Mason once again gives her an offer to become a state witness and take federal protection. Rina steps out of Mason's car to think for a moment, when she discreetly disposes of the seedcodes required to access the cold wallet. She then sits in the car and agrees to testify.Mason takes Rina to Cape Town, South Africa, where he arranges a new life for her. She starts living in a new country under a new identity named Rachel Madison. However, Mason soon finds out that Rina is hiding something from him, yet he ignores the fact and doesn't confront it because he doesn't want Rina to feel like a prisoner. Soon, Mason learns from Keisha Rhodes about a breach in the system because of which the covers of all their witnesses have been compromised, and thus they need to create a new cover for each one of them as soon as possible. Paul Whitlock, Mason's senior, arrives in Cape Town to protect one of his clients, but soon, Mason discovers that Whitlock has been working for Marco and the Syndicate, and thus the entire breach thing was a setup to find out Rina's location. The film from here on follows Mason's pursuit to protect Rina from his own people until the trial.The cold wallet that Rina had stolen from Kosta's safe was a polycarbonate crypto drive used to store some cryptocurrencies that Kosta used for bribes. It could only be opened by the seedcodes that consisted of 24 words that Kosta had engraved on a golden sheet. It was the same sheet that Rina had gotten rid of because she had mugged up all the 24 words. It also made her the only person who knew the seedcodes, therefore acting as an insurance policy for her safety. However, the cold wallet had a tracking code attached to it, and as soon as Rina tried to transfer the money into her account, Whitlock hacked Rina's DAX fiat account and transferred all the money to Ocean Trace International, which was a shipping company that used to sell endangered animals on the black market. Whitlock had been on the task force that was investigating Ocean Trace and probably cracked a deal with them as well to get the money. The seedcodes and the cold wallet were the only things that were protecting Rina so far, and hence, as soon as Marco and Whitlock got the money, they opened fire on Mason and Rina. Marco finally kidnaps Rina from the bank and takes her to the dockyard, from where he had planned to sell Rina on the black market along with a rhinoceros that they had captured.The climax fight takes place between Mason and his mentor, Paul Whitlock, at the dockyard, where Mason is able to get rid of Whitlock forever. He arrived at the docks and, with the help of the two misfits, was able to take down an entire gang of thugs. During the fight, Marco was shot dead by Rina while the rhino took care of Whitlock. It attacked him from behind, pierced his guts with its sharp horn, and took him for a ride. Soon after, Keisha Rhodes arrived at the docks with the team, but it was obvious there was no one important left alive to arrest.Some six months later, Rina appeared at the trial and testified against the Syndicate. After the hearing, Mason gave her a crypto drive that contained 644,000 dollars, probably a part of her cut from the money the authorities had recovered from the account of Ocean Trace International. And as promised, Mason also handed her a new passport with the name Robyn Nhi Nguyen written on it, which was probably her birth name. Mason tells Rina that her new resume will inform the world that she is a financial planner, which was something that Rina always wanted to be, and probably with a huge amount of money in her account, she would be able to plan her finances well. Before finally taking a leave, Rina asks Mason about the ""bud"" tattoo on his body, which, according to Mason, was a homage to all the people he wasn't able to protect and, thus, they had to die a real death. His brother was one such person. As soon as Mason walks Rina to a vehicle, the vehicle blows up. No, Rina doesn't die at this moment. Instead, it was another cover-up so that the Syndicate would not hunt for her, and she could live a peaceful life away from their threats.At the end of ""Eraser: Reborn,"" we see Rina, walking inside a sewer line with Sugar Jax, who has now become Mason's permanent sidekick. The car that blew up was probably parked above a manhole through which Rina and Sugar escaped and blew up the car later to orchestrate their fake deaths. While walking in the sewer line, Rina and Sugar spot a person coming toward them, and soon it is revealed that it is none other than deputy Mason Pollard, who has fallen in love with a witness and is ready to cross the line to be with her. (thanks to dmtalkies)",It is based on U.S. Marshal Mason Pollard who is specialized in engineering the fake deaths of witnesses that leaves no trace of their existence.

Walking back to the car park, Cath's abusive husband Greg takes Cath home. That evening, Nic gets a desperate text from Cath and rushes over only to find Cath's body drowned in a bath and Greg claiming she made him do it.Nine months later, Nic returns from India and reunites with Jodie, Lisa and Annie (Nic and Cath's younger sister) at a rented cabin to a nearby island. After catching up and celebrating their reunion, the group goes on a kayaking trip the next day. While doing some spear fishing, Annie feels something is wrong and briefly notices a shark's dorsal fin. When the group heads back, Annie is then tipped over by a massive great white shark and manages to get back onto the kayak. Lisa turns around to help, but is also thrown from her kayak. Trying to reach Annie, Lisa is killed by the shark.When the three women regroup and paddle back to land, a young girl, Demi, playing with her friend Winston, is bitten by the shark but survives. The three women decide to head to the nearest island for medical help. The children's mothers wait on the island with their children while Nic, Jodie and Annie tie a kayak to either side of an old fishing motor boat to stabilize it and then set off. While venturing across to the next island, the boat is taking in water and then the motor packs up, despite it having enough fuel, all the while encountering the shark along the way.After Nic and Annie get into an argument about Nic being gone, the shark returns and drags Annie into the water, only for Annie to survive. Nic apologizes for not having been there after Cath's death, admitting it was too much for her and she blamed herself for not doing something, even when she believed something was wrong between Cath and Greg. Annie forgives Nic. When the shark reappears, Nic points out that, for some reason, it will hunt them to no end and they need to kill it rather than try to out-paddle it. Using a fish Jodie caught earlier as bait, they attach it to the boat's little anchor, hoping the shark will become stuck on the anchor and drown.It seems to work at first and the three women resume their journey. However, the shark frees itself and attacks them once more. The women then throw a fishing net over the shark, trapping it. When Annie gets tangled in the net with the shark, Nic jumps in and stabs the shark multiple times. The three women rejoice and continue onto the island for help.Sometime later, Annie, Jodie and Nic walk along a beach to a small plaque on a rock commemorating Cath and Lisa, ""dive sisters forever"". After receiving a video call from a fully recovered Demi, they leave flowers, a shell necklace and the original selfie of the four from the start of the film.

They get lucky and find a ride through a local that Ray chats up outside, but this proves to be perhaps the last plot development that breaks their way.Just before boarding, the two manage to link up with their cameraman Sean Tibbets (Justin Huen), a local they find on eerily short notice to come shoot the series for them. Something about Sean seems a little bit off, and those suspicions are confirmed when Ray opens a lunchbox that their third wheel carts around ... only to find a sound system and a set of headphones. They each take a listen, Ray for a bit longer, to hear the odd whale sounds emitted by the device.Sean does his job well enough on board, capturing footage of the charismatic captain Jim (Rune Temte) as well as the various contingents of Swedish tourists, Germans, and Norwegian scientists on board. Alan chats up the latter and learns they are on board to study the region's auroras. As they explain, these are powerful geostorms with the hypothetical power to disable electronic technology - perhaps even the human brain.Not long after the passengers witness a large seal with some conspicuous open wounds brutally mauling a younger animal of its own kind on an ice flow, Sean begins to notice a few other things off on the deck. A man seems to be bleeding out of his ear, and a flock of birds begins to circle ominously. Then, in a moment ... everyone disappears. Everyone, that is, except Sean, Ray, and Alan.The core duo emerges from below deck and tries to figure out where everyone went; Sean lies and says he was in the bathroom when it all went down. None of the electronics work, including the boat itself. Alan begins bleeding from strange gashes. They soon piece together that their fellow passengers did not just disembark so much as they completely disappeared.The trio takes a raft ashore to Svalbard, their original destination, to find no signs of life. Inside an abandoned building, odd and ominous harbingers of abandoned humanity abound like a flickering TV and a skipping Russian record. Alan's condition further deteriorates, as does his trust in Sean. That confidence completely evaporates when he turns on the digital camera from one of the Germans as they videoed each other just prior to their disappearance ... and he spots Sean filming from the deck, thus exposing his dishonesty.When Ray confronts Sean, their shady cameraman finally admits that he is an ex-military operative assigned to document the effects of the exposure to a sonic weapon. Humans are supposed to be merely disoriented by it, not entirely vaporized. His lunchbox headphones provide a countering vibration to the weapon's frequency, inoculating the listener but not saving them entirely.Alan becomes too weak to leave on the raft, and Ray asks him to film a video on his phone for the family he'll be leaving behind. Sensing a threat, Ray puts the phone and camera inside a waterproof pouch and chunks it out to sea. Walking and talking with Sean, his walkie-talkie lights up with a message: ""We have your location. Extraction in 30 minutes.""They transport Alan out of the building in a wheelbarrow, and Ray stays behind with him as Sean goes outside to meet the people who make eye contact. Alan continues to teeter on the verge of death. Shortly after he expires, Ray presses his necklace with a jack on it - a totem expressing his anguish over the loss of a sibling he couldn't save at the age of 10 - into his friend's hands.In the throes of his grief, Ray hears a gunshot ring out. Sean takes a sniper's bullet to the back of the head. Inside the room with Ray, an old phone begins to ring ... and rings ... and rings.After the credits, the camera bag continues to float in search of someone to discover it.

He turns her down, only to offer her a job as a secretary at his tattoo parlor. He gives her a lighter too with the name of his shop, ""Gasoline Alley,"" and his name, ""Jimmy Jayne,"" engraved on it.
The next day, two LAPD detectives arrive at his shop, Detective Vargas (Luke Wilson) and Detective Freeman (Bruce Willis), to question him about a recent homicide. Four other girls were found in a hotel brutally murdered, and one of them was Star. And all the evidence points towards Jimmy. The lighter that was found at the spot had his fingerprints on it. Also, he was the last one to be seen with her before she was murdered. Jimmy decides to clear his name by himself. He makes his way into the morbid world of drugs, violence, and corruption. Jimmy admits he was with Star at the hotel, but he left at 2 30 am.
Jimmy's dad served with the police force himself. He has an alibi as he went to meet his girlfriend Christine at 2 30 am, which she verifies. Vargas is clear that Jimmy is just one hair follicle away from being arrested.Jimmy is clearly a former conman who has a lot of connections. He saved a popular actor Dennis Bourke (Kenny Wormald) from getting beaten up when they both served time together. Dennis tells Jimmy that he knew one of the dead prostitutes that he met at a party with Percy Muleeny. Jimmy also meets a mechanic at Dennis's set, who seems like an upright person.Jimmy is attacked by an unknown person in a land rover, which prompts him to buy an unlicensed gun for protection from the mechanic.
He is also on discreet terms with a cop, who gives him Muleeny's current address. The cop also says that Muleeny's land rover was reported stolen a day before. Both these things do make him more or less a nice guy since the time he served, or maybe even before that. He is well-mannered and amicable, especially to women. So, he is motivated by affection.Getting past Kaiser (Vernon Davis) the Bouncer, Jimmy confronts Percy at his party. Jimmy suspects that Percy met Star and had something to do with the murders, but Percy has an alibi too and Jimmy has no other evidence. There is a lot of drugs in Percy's house. Kaiser later tells Percy that he had seen Star come into Percy's party with Eleanor Rogers (Sufe Bradshaw).
Jimmy tracks down Eleanor, who is a singer. She says Percy likes to hang around drug mafia connections, to play him for a fool. She also says that the 4 girls were at Percy's party. She recollects that she had seen the girls hand over money to a silver haired cop officer Flosso (Ash Adams). She says that Flosso handed over money to someone, who looked like the mechanic.Shortly thereafter, Percy is found murdered in his office, in the same style as the 4 dead girls, brutalized. He used to run a porn filming business. Kaiser's body is found in Jimmy's trunk. Jimmy informs Vargas and Freeman about it. Jimmy thinks Flosso killed Percy, as he is strongly built and can break necks like a twig. He confides in Vargas and says he thinks Freeman is dirty. Vargas says Freeman was at a bar at the night of the murder and Jimmy asks Vargas to check the tapes and bets that Freeman left between 2 and 2 30 am that night.We see him standing in front of a body of water, once in front of a pool (in the rain) at Muleeny's and once in front of the sea. He is thinking about Star at both times. It is immediately after his moments of calmness that he makes his strategic move, he confronts Bourke after the party at Percy Muleeny's (Rick Salomon). Bourke says that a local cop was pimping the girls from Percy's party. He tells Jimmy to talk to Erasmos, a screenwriter and used to date Star. Erasmos talks to Flosso all the time.
Jimmy makes his way to Muleeny's office at Skid Row to interrogate Erasmos (Johnny Dowers). Erasmos says that Star knew that Percy was trafficking drugs from Mexico and found a way to launder the money via his porn film business. He then started trafficking girls. Star knew this and was blackmailing them. So, they used Flosso to kill Star and her friends. Flosso is a cop and was in on the take and the drug mafia used the cops to take care of the blackmailing hookers. Freeman ordered the hit.Jimmy gets a call from Eleanor, who is standing outside Jimmy's parlor. She calls Jimmy and says that he texted her 15 mins ago. Jimmy says he didn't and asks her to run, but someone grabs her and kills her.
Jimmy calls Vargas and says Freeman is definitely engaged in this mess. Vargas agrees and tells Jimmy to stay away from his parlor.
Jimmy still goes and is attacked by Flosso, whom he beats. Vargas arrives and arrests Flosso and sends a word to his unit to arrest Freeman. Jimmy takes advantage of the distraction and drives away with Flosso. He learns that Flosso killed Star and he shipped Eleanor to San Diego to traffic her to Mexico via a tunnel.Jimmy makes Flosso take him the place, and then kills him in the car, by smashing his face. Jimmy enters the tunnel, where Freeman was already taking Eleanor over to Mexico. Jimmy shoots down Freeman and then burns him alive.","A man implicated in the triple homicide of three Hollywood starlets begins his own investigation.

JLO celebrates her 50th birthday. 6 months later in Feb 2020, she performs live at the super-bowl halftime in front of 150 M viewers.
JLo is one of 3 sisters, and wasn't considered a singer in the family. She was the athlete or a dancer. Her mom was into musicals and this inspired JLO to learn singing, dancing and acting. She grew up in the Bronx. West Side Story was her favorite musical.
JLo left the house, as she neglected her education for her dance practice. Her mother insisted that to stay in the house, she needed good grades. She was 18. JLO did random dance gigs all over town, and even taught dancing classes.In Feb 2019, JLO acted in movie Hustlers. She learns to dance on a pole and gets bruises all over her body. She feels that Hollywood is controlled by men, and Hustlers is a movie made by women, telling stories that are important to them. The movie is launched at the Toronto film festival in Sep 2019. Her performance was deemed Oscar worthy.The super-bowl was mired in controversy with NFL players taking the knee during the national anthem for the ""black lives matter"" movement. NFL was having race relations issues and brought in Roc Nation to advise. They wanted a Latina and JLo was a front-runner. JLo is confirmed and will be joined by Shakira. They have 12 mins plus/minus 2 mins for the entire show.
JLo wants to use the show to bring people together in that moment, and showcase their Latina heritage.
Trump has branded all Latinos as drug dealers and rapists and has promised to build a wall across the entire border with Mexico. Children of illegal immigrants were separated from their parents and kept in cages. J Lo wants to speak up against all of thisJ Lo wants to sing ""Born in the USA"", but Shakira is not convinced. JLo's parents came from Puerto Rico. She spends thanksgiving with her family. Mother Lupe, Father David. JLo was surrounded by her mother, grandmother and aunt, who were strong women, who ran everything. Lupe was tough on her daughters and taught them not to depend on a man for anything.
J Lo's big break as a young actress came in the movie ""Selena"". The movie is a hit and JLO starts earning $1 M per movie from this point on. She starts working on her album. JLo hits the #1 both in her movie career and the singing career at the same time. She went from dancer, to actor to singer to a global icon.yet the media always focused on her personal life, branded her the revolving bride, treated her unfairly and said that she had no talent. She was in line to be nominated for an Oscar for her work in Hustlers.
JLo has 3 full time careers at the same time and has almost no time for herself. She attends numerous media commitments to push her case for the Oscars. JLo has 6 mins at the halftime of super-bowl and starts planning her performance. In Dec 2019, JLo is nominated for the Golden Globe for Hustlers.
JLo is really involved in how she wants the super-bowl set to look like, and what her performance would be. J Lo travels with her daughter Emme, whenever she can. JLo meets Emme's dance class and has the idea to put the entire class onstage at the super-bowl.JLo picks her dress for the Golden Globes. JLo is a proud Latina with a wide, voluptuous ass. And the Hollywood idea of beauty was tall, thin and blonde. JLo was not taken seriously, as she was perceived to be too sexy. Her green dress at the Grammy's sparked a revolution that continues to this day.
J Lo is the odds on favorite for the Golden Globe win. But, she loses to Laura Dern. J Lo feels she let her team down, most of whom had been with her for 20 yrs.
JLo and Shakira start rehearsing together in January. There is intense speculation about an Oscar nomination. Yet, there is a feeling that while J Lo is successful, she is not yet respected.. and her personal life has always overshadowed her professional accomplishments. She got divorced at 42 and had 2 kids. American Idol gave her purpose, where she was a judge.She wins the LA film critics award for best supporting actress. But the following Monday, she is overlooked for the Oscar's nomination for best supporting actress. Many women oriented stories and stories / performances from people of color were overlooked. JLo is crestfallen.
The focus is back on the super-bowl. The NFL team pushes back on many of JLO's ideas as it takes too long to set it up on stage and then get it all back down in time for the game to start. The finale is a group of little girls (Emme's friends), performing the Cha-Cha on ""born in the USA"". Emme sings the finale.The closed rehearsals take place and the night before the live performance, the NFL top bosses want to pull the cages from the performance. JLO's big plan was to use the cages to showcase the idea of America being in chains due to its own thinking (immigrant children in cages). the cages are a big part of the performance. NFL was concerned about making a political statement. the NFL was overwhelmingly pro-Trump and there was no way they would let the super-bowl to be used against him.
JLo explains to her crew that the cages are critical to send the message that Latinos are not being treated fairly in America. She tells her managers to get the cages on stage, no matter what it takes.
Feb 2nd, 2020. Super Bowl Sunday. The performance goes flawlessly and the media loves it, along with the entire country. The kids win hearts all over the world.
One yr later, Trump leaves Washington DC after a single term as the POTUS. JLo sings at the inauguration ceremony of Biden and Harris.",Global superstar Jennifer Lopez reflects on her multifaceted career and the pressure of life in the spotlight in this intimate documentary.

The term was first used in 1975 by Laura Mulvey-- who is also a key interviewee in BRAINWASHED. Almost 50 years later, we're still wrestling with the issue. With #malegaze on TikTok hitting 300 million views (and climbing), Lena Wilson, Playlist and Tiktok film reviewer wrote, ""You may think that on-screen sexism is a thing of the past, or that it can't possibly affect our society... Menkes is here to tell you, emphatically, that you are wrong.""
~~~~
BRAINWASHED builds on the vital work of Mulvey and other essential feminist writers including Judith Butler, bell hooks and Angela Carter. Integrating interviews with 21 remarkable women/nonbinary experts (plus one man!) and almost 200 canonical film clips from 1896 through the present, independent filmmaker Nina Menkes exposes, in precise detail, how shot design itself (POV, framing, camera movement, lighting, and even sound) has perpetuated the sexist binary throughout cinematic history. BRAINWASHED then connects these gendered ""laws"" of visual language to the twin epidemics of sexual harassment/assault, as well as employment discrimination against women.Deconstructing our accepted sense of who women are versus who we are ""allowed"" to be, BRAINWASHED gives viewers specific tools for consciousness about their experience of legacy filmmaking and its serious implications for our real lives.","Investigates the politics of cinematic shot design, and how this meta-level of filmmaking intersects with the twin epidemics of sexual abuse/assault and employment discrimination against women, with over 175 movie clips from 1896 - 2020."

There were six individuals. Two of them were lovers (Zee and Lily), two of them were couples (Peter and Angie), and the other two (Tamira and Hunter) were meeting on a blind date for the first time in the restaurant named ""The Collide."" Janice Schoonfeld owned the restaurant, and Mikey ran it as a manager. Angie was having an affair with Mikey, and she lied to Peter about coming home late at night. Peter saw her with Mikey in the restaurant as he was following her. He was a part-time violin player looking to get admission to the ""Royal Carrington Philharmonic Orchestra"". He was distraught to see Angie with Mikey, and he even appointed someone (probably a private investigator) to spy on them. He delivered some tapes that recorded the intimate moments of Angie and Mikey and gave Peter the gun he asked for. Angie gave Peter's money to Mikey so that he could open up their new restaurant. But Mikey was a conman who even stole money from the restaurant and wine too.Now, Zee and Lily work at the restaurant. Zee washed the dishes, and Lily was a waitress there. Zee somehow found a pile of cocaine and contacted a gangster who had given her a time for the exchange of the drug for a massive amount of money. Lily was pregnant with Zee's child, and they thought finding the amount of cocaine was God's grace for them to live a happy life together. Zee hid the packs of cocaine in a fridge at the restaurant. Some items, including wines, were missing from the restaurant, so the owner appointed Mr. Smith to investigate the matter. When he went to look for the missing items in the fridge, he found Zee standing there. Zee could not let him get out as he suspected him of being the thief who was stealing from the fridge. However, Zee went into the fridge to remove the cocaine from there. His brother, Travis, was out of jail and came to visit him and Lily. Lily was so happy to meet Travis that she told him about the drugs. But when Travis went to talk to Zee about the drug and wanted to be a part of the deal, Zee declined any interference in this matter from his side. Soon, when the gangster arrived, Zee went to receive the money in exchange for the drug. But, Travis came along with his group and interfered with the process. Bullets were exchanged from both sides, and a colossal ruckus took place at ""The Collide"" restaurant.Now, the last couple made the ultimate mess in this story. Tamira was waiting for her date, but she seemed a bit tense. When Hunter arrived, we got to know that they were blind dating. After seeing Tamira, Hunter wanted to leave, as he did not want to move forward with the date. But, Tamira suddenly disclosed the time bomb beneath his chair that would blow if he left the chair for once. Hunter could not understand what exactly was going on as Tamira started talking about her childhood. Tamira used to work from 6 a.m. until sunset in a vineyard, probably in Tokai. She was about 11 years old when her father was released from prison and came to get her. Tamira was fed some wine that was not fit to sell. By the time her father saved her from work, she was already an alcoholic. She said there were no rehab facilities that would help a black girl at that time. But her parents tried hard and got her out of the country, making her educated. She said that it was Hunter's father who killed her parents because he was a racist. When Hunter said he was not like his father and never killed anyone, Tamira mentioned a kid named Junior Mafekeng. Soon, Hunter admitted to all the allegations, and then Tamira showed him she had lost her left foot from the blast his father set off to kill her parents. Hunter finally felt the guilt and began apologizing heavily to Tamira. She saw the honesty in his repentance and told him that the bomb would go off eventually, no matter if he sat or not. So, if he wanted to go live his life, he was free to do so. But, Hunter decided to stay and was soon shot during the gunfight. He fell off the chair, and at half past 7, the bomb went off. The film ends with Tamira and Hunter dead inside the restaurant, Peter and Angie injured outside, and Zee and Lily leaving with the briefcase filled with money.

They were expected to live for 90 days.
Once the robot is turned on, it has its own life. There are unexpected issues.They are controlled by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. Jennifer Trosper is the mission manager. Rob Manning is the lead systems engineer. Ashley Stroupe is the rover driver. Goal of the Mars program is to establish if there ever was life on Mars. They were following the water. In 1970's NASA sent the Viking missions, 2 orbiters and 2 lander to get a first close look at Mars.
Steve Squyres was a scientist on the Viking mission. The orbiters saw signs of past water flowing on mars. Steve started writing proposals to NASA to build a rover to look at the Martian rocks up close and determine signs of organics. All his proposals failed. JPL picked up the proposal of Steve's rover and their lander and presented it to NASA.
The goal was to produce 2 identical, autonomous, rovers that could survive on Mars for 90 Sols. The launch window is decided by the alignment of the planets. If you miss it, the next launch window comes in 26 months.Kobie Boykins was the chief engineer on the rovers. Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu is the robotics engineer. The rover was given wheels, a power supply, cameras and a robotic arm with many instruments loaded on it to detect for signs of life. Height of the rover was 5 feet 2 inches, and the cameras looked like eyeballs. The rover was good, but heavy. Landing it on mars was the next issue. The landing system had big airbags that inflated, covered the rover entirely, and bounced around the surface till it came to a halt. In the first tests, Martian rocks ripped the air bags right off.
Parachutes were another challenge. They kept being torn to shreds. its 10 months to launch. Meanwhile Spirit is also failing its test, while Opportunity does perfectly.Launch day. Spirit launches on June 10th 2003. Opportunity on July 7th, 2003. Travel time was 6.5 months. They got hit by the largest series of solar flares in the solar system, in the known history. The flares have particles with enough energy to kill a human being. The particles slam into the rovers and corrupt their software. Both rovers had to be rebooted. it worked and they rebooted. By this time, 2/3rd of the missions to mars had failed. Just 4 years ago NASA launched a polar lander and a climate orbiter, both failed.Spirit and Opportunity were going to land on opposite sides of Mars on Jan 3rd, 2004, and Jan 24th, 2004, respectively. The communication time back to Earth is 10 mins, so the rovers have to navigate atmospheric entries on their own. Heat shields manage temperatures up to 1600 Celsius. Then Parachutes open to bring down the speed further. Then the heat shield is ditched. The lander then rappels down the back shell on a 20 m rope. air bags inflate. The retro rockets on the back shell fire and slows the rover down to 0 mph. The chord is cut, and the lander bounces on the surface till it comes to a complete stop.Spirit lands first (Gusev crater) and gives a signal back to JPL. JPL erupts in joy. Opportunity follows 3 weeks later (Meridiani Planum). Images start pouring back in to Earth. Opportunity's first images included those of bedrock, which is clear evidence of past water flows on Mars.
NASA thought Gusev was bedrock, but all Spirit could find was lava rock. Opportunity's landing site was covered with little round things, like blueberries in a muffin. They were made of hematite, which is a mineral formed in the presence of water. But the water was very acidic, so was there life on Mars? Opportunity climbs out of the Eagle crater.
Spirit's site was much colder, while Opportunity was near the equator of Mars. Spirit touches a particular rock and then drops dead. Its flash memory on board has somehow become corrupted. she has been crashing and rebooting all night. Her batteries were drained. But somehow Spirit pulls through and comes back alive.JPL felt that in 90 days enough Martian dust would accumulate on the solar panels so that the batteries wont recharge and the rovers would eventually die. But Martian tornadoes fly through Opportunity & Spirit and cleans its solar panels to the same shine on the day they landed.
The rovers set out to see Mars. Spirit headed to the Columbia hills. Opportunity heads to the Endurance crater to find deeper bedrock. The endurance crater is deeper than the eagle but has steeper walls as well. The Opportunity slides down the walls, but barely manages to avoid crashing into a giant rock in its way. Opportunity's software program detected the threat and responded appropriately. Once Endurance was mapped, the JPL team wants to map the Victoria crater, which will take 2 years of travel time just to get there.Sol 445 and Opportunity is on its way to the Victoria crater. It gets stuck in soft sand. The engineers reverse the drive and tell Opportunity to go full speed back. But it only gets worse. but then suddenly on Sol 484, Opportunity is able to extract itself free. It gets to Victoria crater 2.5 years into mission life.
Spirit was exploring Columbia hills, but its wheels had been damaged on hard rocks. Then the right front wheel failed. Winter was approaching and in a Martian winter the rovers use much of their energy to keep the instruments above a certain temperature. So, they try to drive her backwards to a tall hill to keep it close to the sun.
Sol 1226, a huge dust storm hits Opportunity. Opportunity survives the storm and Spirit wakes up after the winter. But the team is still looking for Ph neutral water for signs of life.The public was fascinated with the rovers at this point. On Sol 1900, 5 years into the mission, Spirit got stuck in soft sand, and another wheel broke. Winter was approaching. On Sol 2196, the JPL team puts Spirit to sleep. Spirit doesn't wake up the next morning.
Opportunity is still going. The next mission was a huge crater called the Endeavor, but it was many years of driving away. On its way, Opportunity finds 3 meteorites. It has outlasted 4 Martian winters but is sleeping more. 7 years into the mission and Opportunity is 2 Kms away from the Endeavour crater. Oppy starts to show signs of aging with dust between crevices of the cables. One of its shoulder arms gets hard to move. She also started losing her memory. Oppy manages to reach the endeavor crater.Sol 3300, 9 years into the mission. It finds evidence of clay formed in relatively neutral Ph water. Oppy explores the crater for 4 more years and finds clear evidence that water was a huge part of Martian history. Year 14 and Sol 5000 comes around. The team takes a selfie of Oppy. Another dust storm hits Oppy. Oppy goes dark on Sol 5111. The dust finally clears on 5292. The team hasn't heard from the rover in 6 months. But Oppy doesn't wake up this time. They try one last time on Sol 5352. The journey came to an end.
NASA launches the next rover, Perseverance.","The film follows Opportunity, the Mars Exploration Rover affectionately dubbed Oppy by her creators and scientists at NASA. Oppy was originally expected to live for only 90 days but she ultimately explored Mars for nearly 15 years."

He encounters his elderly uncle Ebeneezer Scrooge (Luke Evans) and his dog Prudence, but Scrooge manages to evade him long enough to decline giving any money to a charity and add in a debt owed to him by the local toy shop owner, Tom Jenkins (Giles Terera), who can barely afford medical treatment for his frail mother. Jenkins owed 25 pounds but asks for 2 more days to pay the debt. Scrooge adds another 25 pounds to the debt for the delay and the inconvenience caused to him.After returning to his counting house, he rudely declines an invitation to a Christmas dinner party from Harry and reluctantly lets his clerk, Bob Cratchit (Johnny Flynn), take the day off for Christmas the next day. Bob is underpaid by Scrooge (he deducts wages for any mistakes at work and also cuts his pay for taking a day off on Christmas) and lives in poverty with his wife Ethel Cratchit (Rebecca Gethings) and their many children, including Tiny Tim (Rupert Turnbull), who is seriously ill and cannot receive medical treatment due to being unable to afford it. Scrooge closes up for the night and goes to his usual Tavern for dinner. He and Prudence go home and Scrooge sings about his exasperation with Christmas (""Tell Me"").Once he gets home, he is soon haunted by the spirit of his former business partner and friend, Jacob Marley (Jonathan Pryce), who is forced to pull long, heavy chains around his soul as a penalty for the bad actions he made in life. He warns Scrooge that he will suffer a similar fate when he dies, (except his chains will be even heavier and longer) unless he changes for the better and has arranged for three visitors to come by his house to teach him how to be a better man.Once Scrooge is about to go to bed, he encounters the first visitor, The Ghost of Christmas Past (Olivia Colman) (an excitable shape-shifting ghost made of candle wax with a flame on top of her head), who proceeds to take him through his life before present where he was forced to work in a factory on Christmas Day as a child due to his father being in a Debtors Prison and being visited by his younger sister Jen (Jemima Lucy Newman) (who died in childbirth giving birth to Harry).When he was a young man and worked for a kind-heart businessman named Mr. Fezziwig (James Cosmo) and was once engaged to his daughter Isabel (Jessie Buckley) (""Happiness"") before Jacob Marley partnered with him for a more financially-increased job and Isabel left him when she witnesses Scrooge and Marley shut down a baker family's shop (the baker is revealed to be Bob Cratchit's father) and him focusing more on his business than her (""Later Never Comes""), though Scrooge insists it was because both he and Isabel needed to be financially secure before they could be married.Scrooge then meets the next visitor, The Ghost of Christmas Present (Trevor Dion Nicholas) (a giant, fun-loving spirit wearing a giant green robe), who wants to show Scrooge how to live life (""I Like Life""). He shows Scrooge how Harry will spend Christmas. Harry loves his uncle due to being told of the kindness of Scrooge's sister Jen, who died giving birth to him. He then is shown how the Cratchit family will spend Christmas in their small home and poor health, but go forth in life with happiness, especially Cratchit's youngest son, the disabled Tiny Tim (""The Beautiful Day""). When Scrooge asks the Ghost of Christmas Present about Tim's fate, the Ghost replies saying that he would have to ask the next visitor.Soon, Scrooge meets the next visitor, The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, who shows him a future where Tom Jenkins (the man who Scrooge had made pay large debts) leads a celebration of expressing gratitude to Scrooge (""Thank You Very Much""). At first, Scrooge thinks he's being praised, but Prudence soon finds out they are celebrating his death. Scrooge soon learns the truth himself after finding out that Tiny Tim has passed away and the Cratchit family are devastated. Upon seeing that only a few people have attended his funeral (including an elderly Prudence, who proceeds to abandon Scrooge's grave to parts unknown and a few men who are only attending because lunch was promised), Scrooge is also given an example of what Hell is like, and that is where he will go after death for eternity with heavy chains if he does not change his ways. Scrooge makes a vow that he will change for the better if it means that Tim will live on.The next morning, Scrooge has fully repented his greedy ways and proceeds to spread joy to his associates, like attending Harry's dinner, making Cratchit his business partner and erasing Tom's debt. He also promises Tiny Tim that he will be able to seek medical help with his father's pay rise. Scrooge then celebrates Christmas with his new assortment of companions.

With a little girl at her side, the angered orphanage matron casts a spell that causes Alec to drop dead.In the present day, a Spirit Halloween store opens on the site where the orphanage previously stood. Meanwhile, Jake, a boy on his last year of grade school, is disappointed to discover his friends Carson and Bo think they've grown too old for trick-or-treating, one of the Halloween activities Jake cherished with his dead father. Jake takes out his frustration on his mother Sue, who moved on with a man named Frank and his young daughter Joanie, whom Jake blames for changing their holiday traditions.The day before Halloween, Jake, Carson, and Bo attend a 'Fright Night' event that includes a puppet show that tells 'The Legend of Alec Windsor,' which is about how Alec disappeared mysteriously and supposedly cursed the town. Jake becomes jealous when he sees a popular football player flirting with his crush Kate, who is Carson's teenage half-sister.To compromise between Carson's insistence on doing something more adult and Jake's desire to do something scary, Jake proposes spending Halloween night inside the Spirit Halloween store. Jake brings along his treasured 'Encyclopedia of Shadows' book that his father gifted him. Jake, Carson, and Bo hide in the store, wait for the manager to lock the doors and leave, and then play with the props as paranormal activity starts occurring.Realizing that Carson left his phone behind, Kate goes to Jake's house to give it to him. From Jake's mom Sue as well as Bo's Grandma G, Kate puts together that the boys lied about their Halloween plans, but Kate covers for them. From Jake's Instagram photos, Kate concludes the three friends went to the Spirit Halloween store and she sets off to find them.Vexed by the paranormal activity in the store, Jake shows Carson and Bo the Encyclopedia of Shadows entry about Alec Windsor, who they later confirm died on that exact site. The boys then ask a fortune-telling Zoldrana machine if it is Alec's ghost haunting them. Alec's spirit emerges from Zoldrana to possess a grim reaper animatronic. The reaper chases the boys until they finally knock it apart.Kate enters the store through a skylight on the roof. After she finds the boys, Alec possesses a giant teddy bear that menaces all four of them. Jake's book reveals that for one hour on the anniversary of their deaths, tortured spirits can possess objects or people, although a person needs to be asleep or unconscious.Kate, Jake, Carson, and Bo search for a way out of the store in the basement. The four of them discover a tunnel leading to a massive subterranean cavern where they find Alec's skull. Inside a witch's shack in the cavern, the quartet also finds a note detailing what is happening and what they need to do. The note reads, ""Burn three things he haunts with glee, seal with a sacrifice to set him free, if by midnight he inhabits thee, your body he'll take for eternity.""Alec attacks everyone by possessing a spider like creature prop. Bo kills the monster by burning it with a flame and bug spray.Still suspicious from her earlier conversation with Kate, Sue sets off to find out where her son really went. Flashing lights in the distance draw Sue toward the Spirit Halloween store.To satisfy the sacrifice component of banishing Alec's spirit, Kate offers her grandmother's necklace. However, Alec possesses a skeleton and secretly picks the necklace out of Jake's pocket.With the necklace suddenly missing, Carson proposes that Jake sacrifice his keepsake photo of his dad. Jake's refusal to do so sparks an argument and then a physical fight as Carson accuses Jake of being unable to let go and grow up.Alec possesses Kate after knocking her unconscious with prop eyeballs rolling on the floor. Through Kate, Alec creates chaos throughout the store by supernaturally puppeteering multiple props and animatronics that the boys battle.Jake eventually stops Alec by capturing Kate with a rope. Jake then sacrifices his Encyclopedia of Shadows, which was inscribed by his father, to be burned alongside the fortuneteller, reaper, and teddy bear props. Alec's spirit leaves Kate and vanishes. Jake, Carson, Bo, and Kate escape outside where they reunite with Jake's mom Sue, who takes everyone home. The manager arrives the next morning to find the store in total disarray.One year later, Jake happily takes Joanie trick-or-treating prior to spending Halloween evening with Carson and Bo. Meanwhile, Grandma G, revealed to have been the little girl who witnessed Alec Windsor's death, casts a spell over Alec's skull inside the subterranean shack. Grandma G suddenly disappears and the skull begins to glow.

tt21929356,4085,10,1,7.0,['Documentary'],"['science', 'psychedelic animation', 'cat', 'infinity', 'math']",https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2153366041/,"['Alan Lightman', 'Delilah Gates', 'Stephon Alexander']","['Jonathan Halperin', 'Drew Takahashi']","The documentary explores the concept of infinity through interviews with mathematicians, physicists and philosophers around the world.Alan Lightman is a physicist. Delilah Gates, Carlo Rovelli, Brian Greene & Anthony Aguirre are theoretical physicists. Stephon Alexander is a Cosmologist. Steven Strogatz, Eugenia Cheng & Moon Duchin are mathematicians.
Rebecca Newberger Goldstein & Kenny Easwaran are philosophers.The basic idea of infinity is that numbers never end. Any number, no matter how big is insignificant in comparison to infinity.
To be conscious is to be dealing with infinity.Rebecca thinks that infinity is just a product of our minds. But humans are born with a fear of the infinite: a bottomless pit, a nightmare that you cannot wake up from, time that never ends and so on.
Some people find infinity uplifting as they know that they are part of something far bigger than themselves.In Mathematics something exists, if there are rules for it and it can be controlled. But infinity leads to paradoxes and contradictions.
In an infinity hotel, there are infinite rooms, and all the rooms are occupied. When a new guest shows up, the manager simply asks each existing guest to move to the next room. Guest in 1 moves to 2, in 2 moves to 3 and so on. This way everyone still has a room and room 1 is empty.
If infinite new guests show up, the manager tells everyone to move to the room double of their current room. This way all the odd number rooms are now empty, and the new guests move into it.The manager takes 15 minutes to clean the first room, and half of the previous room for each subsequent room. ¼+1/8+1/16 and so on to infinity adds to up to 1 Hour. The manager will be done cleaning all the rooms in one hour. But there is no way out for the manager from infinity.
Infinity + 1 = Infinity. But if you subtract infinity from both sides, you get 1 = 0.A circle is infinity. It has infinite corners and sides. But then circles have no corners, so infinity is now like zero. A small circle and a large circle, both have infinite number of points on their surfaces.
But infinity is not singular. There is a whole hierarchy of infinities. There are smaller infinities and bigger infinities.
Mathematicians tamed infinity with the invention of calculus. The calculus you can study a complicated thing by breaking it up into simpler things. Solve the problem for the simpler things and add the results back together to get the complicated whole.
Understanding of electricity was only made possible by calculus.Infinity exists in the world of mathematics, as it has a symbol, it has rules, and it solves problems in the real world.
Does infinity exist in the real world. The night sky is theoretically infinite. But infinity cannot be measured, it cannot be accessed, and nobody can wrap their arms around it. All a laboratory can measure is approximations of infinite numbers.
The Universe itself started expanding at a rate which was an irrational number. So, maybe the Universe itself is carrying out a giant computation.Matter is not continuous as it cannot be infinitely divided. It is made of atoms, electrons and protons. But you can keep dividing space forever. But even space cannot be divided beyond Planck length which is 10 to the power of -33 centimeters. So, even space is not truly continuous, it is discreet.Black Holes are the real infinities. A Black Hole is an infinitely dense mass of matter from which even light cannot escape. Every Black Hole has an event horizon. Once you cross the event horizon, you keep falling till you reach the singularity, or the middle point of the black hole with infinity density and infinite curvature. At this point, one simply falls out of existence. At this point, the laws of nature break down.
A black hole could be a portal into a new Universe.A Universe inhabits a finite space with a finite mass & a finite amount of energy and a finite number of configurations in which those mass and energy particles can exist. So, if space does go on infinitely far, then it is inevitable that the patterns and configurations of mass and energy will repeat themselves. There will be copies of us in another part of the Universe doing exactly the same thing.
Anything that can happen will happen an infinite number of times.
Because speed is not infinite, all we can ""see"" is the past of different galaxies, stars and planets. Light is too slow to travel between Galaxies, or even within a Galaxy.
The Universe just goes on and on and on. We were not here a million years ago, and we will not be here a million years from now and the Universe does not care.Einstein postulated that Universe is finite, but without walls. If you exit the Universe from one side, you simply enter the Universe from the other side. There are an infinite number of ways to make the Universe finite and only 2 ways to make the Universe infinite.
Since speed of light is finite, we will never be able to know what is beyond the observable subset of the Universe.Universe is expanding and the rate of expansion is increasing. So, eventually, we will be cut off from other Galaxies, and the nuclear fuel in our Galaxy will run out and the Galaxy will die. With the same process, eventually in a 100 billion years the Universe will come to an end. All that will be left at that point are particles wafting through the darkness.",Can we experience the infinite? The world''s most modern scientists and mathematicians embark on a search for the infinite and its amazing effects on the universe.

The crowd cheers for him with enthusiasm and the commentator Rob Stone (Himself) joins them in their support for this brilliant player. Not just is Zlatan loved but also considered a front-runner for the award - All-Star Cup All-Star of All-Stars of All Time, at the end of the tournament. While he jumps around with joy and energy, 'Weird Al' Yankovic (himself) (who happens to be at the stadium for some reason) tells Rob that he is also hoping to win this prestigious cup.After interviewing these two celebrities, Rob sees a tall man with a child's face and asks for his opinion. The man walks in the other direction, and we see the kids standing on one other's shoulders to look like an adult. Two boys (O'Dang (Kieran Walton) & Palio (Arnie Pantoja)) and two girls (Nautai (Tania Gunadi) & Zana (Madison Zamor)) fall and start walking toward the players' lounge. Inside, they find Zlatan and cannot believe that they are seeing him in person. Zana impresses him with her goalkeeping skills, whereas Nautai impresses him with her juggling expertise. Afterward, they introduce themselves as Creature Catchers - a group that specializes in pest control services.The group of 4 wanted tickets to watch football, and Zlatan offers to give them these tickets - after also hearing their stories. The tickets are in exchange for a promise that the team will have his back in case he needs a creature caught. He goes inside to freshen up and finds a football inside a gift box. When he peeps into the box and holds this ball, it suddenly opens up to show a fluorescent green-tinted layer inside. A ghastly, little slug walks out and starts screeching. The kids hear this screech and one of the boys runs inside to see if everything is fine. He sees Zlatan getting infected by this creature and turning into a green mutant. The slug bites Zlatan's ponytail to turn him into a vile creature and then once he gets infected, he runs away, breaking the wall.Since the kids witness it in person, they decide to find Zlatan and save him. They don their creature catching outfits. On their way, they meet Megan Rapinoe (Megan Rapinoe). Since Nautai is a huge fan of hers, she is constantly looking to get a selfie with this celebrity. While the monster version of Zlatan jumps around in the city creating havoc, Megan also gets bitten by a slug and turns into a mutant. Meanwhile, Weird Al Yankovic, who is a famous doctor in this city, becomes a mayor with huge public support. While that happens, Zlatan's ponytail becomes a talking creature in itself and starts swaying him towards doing some evil tasks.The kids follow Megan and try to capture her using conventional means. They finally manage to help Megan escape the slug's mutant spell with a whoopee cushion (The sonic quality of the whoopee triggers the mutation), that Nautai was carrying around her all the time. The use of the whoopee cushion both activates and deactivates the slug's mutant spell. They consider it as a solution to find the bite of the slugs. Megan tells them about the all star game. 2 kids go with Megan to ensure that the game proceeds and 2 go to find and bring Zlatan to the game.
While Zlatan decides to get to the bottom of Al's sudden rise to success, he realizes that it is Al's plan to sabotage his success at the All-Stars tournament. Al wants the prestigious cup for himself. The slug sucked up all of Zlatan's talent into his pony tail. After this, he also plans to do the same with more stars.After some time, Al reverses Zlatan's mutation while cutting off his signature ponytail. While locked in chains, he cries for the loss of this feature. He feels that he has lost all power as a result of this and wants to get hold of the ponytail back. However, Al manages to get it himself and attaches it to his hair. He turns into a powerful mutant himself, who is more skilled in football than the likes of Zlatan. Meanwhile, in the players' dressing room, the kids and Megan try to see if any one of them is a mutant. They try using the whoopee cushion, which does not work with one player, who turns out to be a mutant.While the lack of skills disheartens Zlatan after losing his ponytail, the kids help him get his confidence back and train him to play just as effectively as he did before. All of them run back to the stadium to play in the All-Stars tournament so that Zlatan can get the All-Star Cup All-Star of All-Stars of All Time, as he wished to have, and was considered to be deserving of. Megan, Zlatan and all the kids decide to play as a single team and run to the stadium with a winning spirit. Al stands on the opposite side, with a determination to win.Slug mutants (with the stolen talent) play from Al's side, and while his team keeps scoring one goal after the other, Zlatan's team struggles to keep up. However, they learn some tricks to overcome their limitations and start scoring goals as well. Over time, the stadium starts cheering for Zlatan like before and Al loses faith in himself. The ponytail then decides to leave his body, thinking that he does not deserve to have this talent. It also deflates him as if he is an inflatable object.Since the mutant ponytail is determined to get all the talent possible, it turns itself into a giant creature that looks somewhat like a giant mouth with an eye in the middle. While it eats all the slugs, Weird Al gets inflated back into his regular form and everyone seeks vengeance against the giant ponytail creature, together. In the end, they all win over this evil and start playing football on their own, outside the tournament. However, the fear of the slugs persists, who might unexpectedly return anytime in their lives to create havoc.",Four young soccer superfans team up to help their idols regain their abilities after a scheming evil scientist steals their talent.

Fearon']",['Sharon Roggio'],"1946 is a feature documentary that follows the story of tireless researchers who trace the origins of the anti-gay movement among Christians to a grave mistranslation of the Bible in 1946. It chronicles the discovery of never-before-seen archives at Yale University which unveil astonishing new revelations, and casts significant doubt on any biblical basis for LGBTQIA+ prejudice. Featuring commentary from prominent scholars as well as opposing pastors, including the personal stories of the film's creators, and original music by Grammy winning artist Mary Lambert, 1946 is at once challenging, enlightening, and inspiring.Kathy Baldock, a straight ally, Christian LGBTQIA+ activist, and leading expert on LGBTQIA+ issues in the United States along with Ed Oxford, an LGBTQIA+ Christian researcher and a Masters of Divinity graduate of Talbot School of Theology, have been seeking to answer these questions and more. Kathy is currently writing, FORGING A SACRED WEAPON: HOW THE BIBLE BECAME ANTI-GAY, by tracing the creation of anti-gay theology in America and analyzing how the Bible has been weaponized against LGBTQIA+ people.In the summer of 2017, Kathy and Ed's research* led them to Yale University, where they were the first two people to investigate what caused the 1946 R.S.V.** translation team - the first team in all of history - to use the word ""homosexual"" in any language. The translation team under the supervision of Dr. Luther Weigle combined two Greek words in the Biblical passage I Corinthians 6:9-10, ""Malakoi"" and ""Arsenokoitai"", resulting in the modern term, ""homosexual."" After prolonged research, Kathy and Ed discovered a letter penned by a 21-year old seminary student known as David S. David writes in 1959:""I write this letter after many months of serious thought and hard work, partly to point out that which to me is a serious weakness in translation, but more because of my deep concern for those who are wronged and slandered by the incorrect usage of this word. Since this is a Holy Book of Scripture sacred to the Christians, I am the more deeply concerned because well meaning and sincere, but misinformed and misguided people (those among the clergy not excluded) may use this Revised Standard Version as a sacred weapon, not in fact for the purification of the church, but in fact for injustice against a defenseless minority group which includes the sincere, convicted spiritually reborn Christian who has discovered himself to be of homosexual inclination from the time of his memory. I write this letter with certain homosexual individuals in mind - Christians who would die for their faith, their church, and their Lord but who cannot alter their biological state of being. I hope that the committee responsible for considering any possible corrections or revisions of the R.S.V. text may take my case here presented into consideration.""Additional correspondence between David S. and Dr. Weigle had the profound effect of changing Dr. Weigle's position; the R.S.V. translation team did in fact replace the word ""homosexual"" in 1st Corinthians 6:9-10 to ""sexual perverts."" Unfortunately, due to poor timing, the change did not take effect in the R.S.V.-Revised until 1971. By then, 25 years had past, and the damage was done. Three other independent teams were already working on other Bible translations, each using the 1946 R.S.V. as their base text. These newer translations become responsible for the spread of the word ""homosexual"" throughout a multitude of new passages.","The mystery of how theology, history, culture, and politics led to a Biblical mistranslation, the man who tried to stop it, and the impassioned academic crusade of the LGBTQIA+ Christian community driven to discover the truth."

After their show, band manager Richie Rowley Jones, who is also Leigh's boyfriend, introduces Jordan and Leigh to country star Caleb Crawford in hopes of getting them to open his upcoming tour. Jordan ends up going home with Caleb for a one-night stand.Jordan notices a photograph of Caleb with country music legend Harper Dutchess, who became a recluse following the tragic death of her sister Hope, who was the other half of their Dutchess Sisters duo. Caleb mentions he was supposed to record a duet with Harper, but she called off the project. Although Caleb warns that something is off about Harper, Jordan gets the idea that she and Leigh may be able to record with her since they are a female duo like the Dutchess Sisters.Having obtained her address from Caleb, Jordan convinces Leigh that meeting Harper could be their big break. Following an awkward conversation over a callbox, Harper invites the two of them inside her rundown mansion in a remote location.Over the course of their subsequent discussions, Harper comes to see herself in Jordan while similarly seeing her sister Hope in Leigh. While insisting that the girls drink alcohol with her, Harper uses psychology to play up the rivalry between Jordan and Leigh. Harper eventually agrees to play music with the two of them, although they are both alarmed by Harper's strange behavior, which includes suddenly smashing a guitar.Jordan and Leigh spend the night after getting blackout drunk with Harper. Both women wake up the next morning to find themselves dressed in old Dutchess Sisters merch. Through a keyhole, Jordan spies Harper talking to an invisible person.Sensing something strange, Jordan proposes that she and Leigh leave. However, after throwing a tantrum over breakfast, Harper continues to hang the promise of recording a song with her over the duo's head to compel them to stay.Harper gets Jordan and Leigh drunk again. Harper continues deepening the divide between the two friends by exploiting their drastically different opinions about Leigh's relationship with their manager Richie. Harper then convinces the two women to vent their frustrations by violently fighting with each other.Richie arrives at the mansion looking for Jordan and Leigh. Claiming it's because Jordan doesn't like Richie anyway, Harper locks Jordan in the basement before going upstairs to talk to Richie with just Leigh.Jordan discovers a secret room dedicated to Harper's sister Hope hidden behind a bookcase. Among the mementos, Jordan finds jars containing severed body parts collected from Hope. Jordan uses Hope's severed finger to open an electronic lock that frees her from the basement.From outside the living room, Jordan overhears Richie plotting with the other two women to make a new duo out of Leigh and Harper, which would leave Jordan in the lurch. When Leigh goes to the kitchen, Jordan confronts her and tries explaining what she found in the basement, but Leigh refuses to listen. Meanwhile, Harper suddenly stabs Richie to death.Harper collects the two women and together they record the last song that Hope wrote. Afterward, Harper takes Jordan and Leigh to her bedroom where she has them put on makeup and stage outfits. Jordan observes Harper saying ""almost there"" to a photograph of Hope.Jordan and Leigh resume arguing contentiously. Harper states her belief that Hope brought the duo to her so Harper could have a shot at redemption by ""evening things out."" Harper suddenly terrorizes Jordan and Leigh with a shotgun, prompting them to flee back to the basement where they collect pistols that Jordan discovered earlier. On the way, Jordan and Leigh stumble upon Richie's dead body.Harper hallucinates hearing and seeing Hope. Jordan and Leigh use the distraction to knock Harper to the floor.

Bubba's cousin Chris Rhymer and her young son Jeremy come to town to hide after she testified against her crooked boss Harold Vance and sent him to prison. They move in with Aunt Hilda, who quickly tries to displace Jeremy's mother in his life.
A crooked farm boss tells his employee, Shrievie, to quit slacking off. Shrievie replies that she thought it was okay because the boss has a scarecrow. The boss looks, but the scarecrow is now gone. He says that he never had one before. The boss is trying to force Aunt Hilda off of her land. The scarecrow kills him and then, when his assistant tries to force Hilda off of her land too, he is also killed by the scarecrow. Shrievie is suspected of the murders and goes on the run. Discontented, Jeremy has already become friends with a scarecrow and is making little toy figures of him. Chris also sees a scarecrow in the corn field and starts talking about her secrets with him, planting a flower in its lapel which is somehow returned to her while she sleeps one night. Shrievie is killed by the scarecrow, too, and burned to death in an old barn. Another one of the boss's men sees the scarecrow on the road one day and he is scared out of his truck and then run over by another truck and killed. Chris knows something is going on, and the vegetable seller is reluctant to talk about what happened to her cousin Bubba 40 years ago, but he says that Hilda knows. Hilda is vague about it, although she did take Chris and Jeremy to Bubba's grave earlier. Chris's new friend, Sheriff Orrin Tutt, does some research and finds out what happened to Bubba 40 years ago. Jeremy tells his mother that the scarecrow's name is Bubba and she knows something is up. But before she can press the matter further, Vance's lawyer gets him out on parole and he comes to town and recruits its crooked deputy to lure Chris into a trap in a barn, claiming that Sheriff Tutt is there. The deputy had pointed out that all this trouble had started once Chris had came to town, but the sheriff said to leave her alone. Chris is bound and gagged, but the scarecrow appears and hangs the deputy by his neck in the barn until he is dead. Chris tells Jeremy they have to go on the run again and he is very upset, but Hilda says there may be a way they can prevent it. Vance is waiting when Chris gets back to her house and he answers about how going on the run has caused his marriage to fail, his friends to turn against him and made her haggard and that Jeremy resents her for it, but says now Jeremy will have a better home to live in when she is dead. He forces her at gunpoint out into the corn field and makes her dig her own grave, but she throws some dirt at him when the corn rustles and he chases after her, only to be attacked by the scarecrow, thrown into the grave and impaled through his heart with the shovel. Sheriff Tutt consoles Chris later and reveals that Bubba was killed while he was hiding in a scarecrow costume. Chris goes to Hilda's house and finds that Jeremy does not want to leave and that Hilda is actually trying to persuade Jeremy to convince the scarecrow to kill Chris so that she can keep Jeremy there to be her dead nephew's playmate and guide. Chris tells Jeremy that the scarecrow is a child in his mind, that he should do the right thing and let him go, and that she loves him. Jeremy leaves with his mother and Hilda swears revenge. She goes to the scarecrow and hugs it, saying that she will find him another playmate and that they will have their revenge. The scarecrow crushes her to death and hangs her corpse up on its pole.
The next day, Sheriff Tutt and the Mayor cover the whole matter up to protect themselves, and Chris is now in the clear. Chris and Jeremy drive out of town back to their old house. In the corn field, the scarecrow turns its head and watches them as they leave. It opens its hand and a flower drops to the ground. A crow caws.","When Chris Rhymer and her young son Jeremy are forced to relocate to a small rural community, they have no idea of the past terror that their presence re-awakens."

The biggest of these jobs is building an addition to their house so they can produce more of their ""recipe"", which is now legal.Even though Thanksgiving is several days away, the family members tell what they are thankful for as they sit down to eat.Elizabeth and Jim-Bob are playing when Abner's truck arrives with equipment for the County Fair. The children meet a red-haired boy identified only as ""Red"", who says he will be working the duck pond at the fair. He is very friendly and quite intelligent, but he lived in an orphanage until Abner and his wife made him their foster son. The boy, who the Walton children later describe as older than Erin and younger than Mary Ellen, is treated harshly by his foster father, who seems only interested in getting the boy to work for him and not in a permanent adoption. The children give the boy a lucky penny.Elizabeth wants a pet bunny but the family has enough animals and can't have any just as pets.After coming home from work and cleaning up, John-Boy meets the new librarian Edith, who has come to deliver Erin a book about Romeo and Juliet. Erin, who is 13, wants to portray Juliet in the fair's talent show. John-Boy seems interested in Edith, who is also in his class at school, though there are no scenes showing them at school. However, he has also received a letter from Maggie, the previous librarian who cannot come home from college unless she gets a ride. John-Boy's interest in both girls is distracting him from more important responsibilities.At Ike's store, Olivia meets the Baldwin sisters and mentions that she will be one of the judges in the fair's pie contest. Rose, who is also there, will be a judge as well. The Baldwins think this will be good for Grandma Walton, who wins the pie contest every year with a pecan pie that has a secret ingredient. Olivia claims she will be impartial but is having her doubts.Mary Ellen wants to sing at the talent show and she is very good. But she thinks Jason isn't playing the banjo well enough and keeps stopping to criticize him. Sister Harriet and Brother William, who are watching the pair practice at their church, try to give advice, while Erin reads her book and seems to be enjoying the bickering.Grandpa and Grandma show up at the Walton house. Jim-Bob asks Grandpa if he ever hit his kids, and Grandpa says no, because his father believed in hitting his kids, and Grandpa managed to find a way to keep his rowdy boys in line without hitting. Inside, Grandma says she is out of her secret ingredient and wants to know if Olivia has any. She confesses that it is the Baldwins' recipe, and she correctly assumes John has some.Erin rehearses her performance in front of the family but the young kids are bored. Mary Ellen and Jason continue to disagree on how they should handle their situation, but Jason agrees to play for her if she will do his chores.After she finds out Olivia will be one of the judges, Grandma is outside Ike's store when she tells Grandpa she feels good about her chances because she knows her pie is the best and not because Olivia is family. While Grandpa goes in the store to get aspirin for Grandma's headache, Grandma puts the pie where he will be sitting and he sits on it, thinking that was an accident.It is time for the fair. The family goes together and, while they will go their separate ways for different activities, they are all expected to meet later. Edith comes with John-Boy, who is advised he will still be responsible for Elizabeth.Grandma sneaks into the tent with the pies and pours recipe in her pie. After she leaves, Olivia, Rose and the third judge, Charlie, arrive.Mary Ellen meets a boy. They compete in a game involving water pistols.Elizabeth sees the duck pond and wants to play. However, John-Boy and Edith take her on rides. Afterward, she doesn't feel so good. Still, she sees that the duck pond has a large bunny as a prize and she wants to win it. Using a fishing line, Elizabeth has to catch one of the ducks. If it has a 3 on the bottom, she wins the big prize. Every duck has a 1 and John-Boy runs out of money. The boy running the game gives her his lucky penny and Edith chips in. Elizabeth wins the big prize. Actually, she didn't pick a duck with a 3 on it, but the boy pretended. Abner finds out and is very hard on the boy, saying no one is to win the big prize, and that he will have to keep working long enough to make enough to pay for the big bunny.The pies are judged. Grandma's looks and tastes terrible, and only Charlie believes it is the best one. Olivia can't tell which pecan pie is Grandma's, which is just as well. When Grandma loses, she says she has plenty of blue ribbons.At the talent show Erin freezes. She is comforted offstage by Olivia, and then Mary Ellen sings with Jason on banjo. The boy Mary Ellen likes is in back, and Mary Ellen stops singing. Jason helps out by singing the words she was supposed to, and they do a duet until Mary Ellen is confident once again. A saw musician who was shown wins first prize. Another person whose talent the movie did not show wins second place, and Mary Ellen and Jason come in third. They are still happy.The family is supposed to meet for the fireworks later. Maggie shows up, saying she got a ride, and she and John-Boy have a conversation, while Edith is nearby. While he is distracted, Elizabeth sees a bunny in the woods. The duck pond boy sees her follow the bunny. When John-Boy realizes Elizabeth is missing, the family and others search all over for her. The duck pond boy knows where she went but won't say anything. Elizabeth falls and hurts herself but keeps going, leaving her stuffed bunny behind. Dhe realizes she is lost and starts calling for help.The duck pond boy finally decides to go after Elizabeth. Abner sees he has left and angrily puts up the ""closed"" sign. The boy finds Elizabeth and brings her back. No one is in trouble (except the boy). Everyone is just glad to see her. Abner grabs the boy and mistreats him, and John tells him he shouldn't do that and that there will be consequences. John tells the boy his name and to come to him if Abner ever does that again.The family watches the fireworks and it is time to go home.Olivia and John agree John-Boy is punishing himself enough and they don't need to take any other action. There is a knock on the door. The boy has been beaten up, and he walked the entire six miles because John had said to come to him if he needed to. He had no place to go and everyone knows how to get to the Walton place.The boy is given a place to sleep but he is used to the floor, so Olivia and John are shocked to find he slept there. The boy is outside doing chores to repay the Waltons for what they did for him.Abner is arrested and his wife, who was also abused, is free of him.The family accepts the boy and treats him as one of their own.

An uninvited but lucky encounter with Greta, a grade school frenemy, brings Dorothy to a free luncheon at the Alabaster Women's Chamber of Commerce, run by Genie, the town matriarch. Here, Dorothy learns that her high school bully Brent is running as a Republican for State Legislature. Enraged and motivated to thwart him at all costs, Dorothy goes on a deep internet dive and discovers a political loophole - under Texan law regarding this race, if a party's primary nominee drops out of the race before the general election, no new candidate can be named by that party...thereby almost ensuring the seat goes to the other party's candidate. Dorothy can run as a Republican, beat Brent, then give up her nomination to force a win for the Democratic candidate - a woman who has run four times, but never won.Dorothy returns to her roots, with a full MakeoverXGlenn(TM), as a true Republican candidate.

Photos from her family album and an image of a triangular house flash by. This is footage from a video obituary by former documentary filmmaker Erica Shaw.Somehow, she guessed about the affair of the deceased and included in the selection a photograph of the house, where, apparently, lovers met. In the future, we learn that the heroine has something like psychic abilities and can see what others do not notice.The deceased's sister breaks into Erica's house and aggressively offers Erica a new job involving her dying father, Campbell Bradford. The woman offers the heroine to become a director again and shoot material about this man. The point is to find out about his secrets, which were in abundance. The guest leaves Erika an advance and a bottle of water that miraculously survived the accident, previously kept in the Kempell Bradford safe. The bottle depicts a demon and says ""Pluto"" (""Pluto"").The heroine reluctantly agrees to work and first of all goes to the hospital where Campbell is. The man communicates with Erica, but in a mysterious way: the conversation takes place only when the girl looks into the camera lens. Kempell talks about the city where he grew up. This is West Baden Springs. According to Campbell, So Cold the River flows under the city and it's a good place to disappear without a trace. Erika takes out a bottle and shows it to her. Campbell says, ""His blood... His name... The seal is broken... What have you done?""The heroine arrives in West-Baden and checks into a beautiful hotel with a huge dome. She is greeted by a smiling receptionist, Dylan, who talks about the upcoming rebirth festival and concludes, ""Don't underestimate the charm of our city - we'll still get you."" Already in the room, Erika has a vision. Before her appears a man in a black suit and a hat. The girl swallows pills and drinks water from the same bottle. Immediately another vision flashes: a boy playing the violin. The water in the bottle gets colder.In the lobby of the hotel, Erica strikes up a conversation with an elderly woman, Ann McKinney. She talks about West-Baden, about the water from the local springs, which is considered healing, mentions the festival of rebirth and offers to drink for eternal life. At the mention of Kempell Bradford's name, the woman immediately leaves.Another vision: a man with a hat, a boy and another man on the bridge. And then one more thing: a man in a hat rides a train along an abandoned railway.To the heroine comes assistant trainee Kellyn Cage. She is a fan of Erica. In a conversation, they recall the documentary ""Little Hell"" and its hero Loni Wilks. The painting played a key role in overturning the sentence for this man, after which he killed his family. Kellin says that despite all this, the film is beautiful and it influenced her a lot.And again before Erica appear a man in a hat and a boy with a violin. The girl meets a local laborer, Josiah. He talks about his great ambitions - he wants to rule this hotel and even the whole world, and he also has dynamite hidden somewhere. It turns out that his last name is also Bradford. Erica and Josiah enter the girl's room and Josiah takes a sip of water from a bottle. There is a small quarrel, a man in a hat flickers in the mirror. The guy leaves.Visions after another sip from the bottle: again three on the bridge, then a man convicted of murder and nailed to the wall in a hat.In the morning, Erica is greeted in the lobby by Dylan, who advertises local healing water baths for her and asks, ""Ready to be reborn?"" The girl refuses.The image of the man in the hat now haunts Josiah as well.Erica interviews Ann McKinney, who talks about Campbell Bradford. It turns out that Josiah is his great-grandson and the only one left here from the Bradford family. Ann says that Campbell was a terrible killer.He wanted to own the whole city, but he couldn't get the hotel because the owner refused to sell it. Then Campbell killed the owner, kidnapped his young son, and then killed the sheriff and the FBI officer who went looking. The boy was never found - only his violin. Ann concludes: ""Campbell was an absolute monster. If it settles in your head, you will start seeing it everywhere.""The customer calls up Erica and asks to stop working, but the girl got a taste and does not want to stop. She tells Josiah that Campbell Bradford is still alive, and provokes the guy to give a revealing interview. In it, he blames his great-grandfather for the death of his relatives, although they died under different circumstances and not at the hands of Kempell.Erica pretends that the camera is off, cheers Josiah up, says that she believes in him and urges her to stop thinking about the family curse. Then another person seems to move into the guy. He defiantly admits that he is a loser and reveals that he was fired for stealing dynamite from his job. He says that he wants to become a real element, that he can bring down a huge building in an instant, and laughs ominously. Josiah also states that Bradford's curse is actually a gift. It is death that is in his blood.Kellin is discouraged by the camera-off feint, but Erica says that's how the beautiful films the trainee admires so much are made.Vision: Campbell burns the owner of the hotel in front of the boy. Meanwhile, Josiah is talking to Campbell. He says: ""This is not a curse, but a gift. My blood, my name is the best you have. You can't run away from yourself, and even more so from me."" The water in Erica's bottle turns red.Kellin reviews the footage from the hospital and discovers that Erica was actually talking to herself. She objects: she believes in the reality of visions and says that they become brighter thanks to the water from the bottle. And with the help of these visions, you can discover the secrets of the past and make wonderful films again. Kellin retorts: in the works of Erica, she was attracted not by the gloom that everyone saw, but by the grain of something bright and kind - the way the director coped with darkness.The trainee wants to leave. However, Erica stops her and tells the shocking truth: she knew that Loni Wilks was guilty, she saw his true nature, but between art and truth she chose the first and does not regret it. The director asks the trainee, ""Do you think you would have done things differently? If you were one step away from the goal that you have pursued all your life, would you act according to your conscience? Kellin will answer: ""No, that's why I'm leaving.""Erica takes the bath that Dylan advertised for her, sees the three on the bridge again and the scene of the murder. She is a man in a hat - Campbell, who is becoming more and more material. The heroine faints in the lobby of the hotel. The water in the bottle turns to ice. After - a shot with Erica's crazy look.Kellin, still staying at the hotel, talks to Ann, who, looking at the preparations for the rebirth celebration, says: ""I see a city that does not allow anyone to send it to oblivion,"" then asks about Eric: ""What do you think she sees? "". Kellin is at a loss: ""And which of us is right?""Feast of Rebirth. People raise a toast to eternal life. Josiah goes down to the basement, followed by Ann and sees a bag of dynamite. The guy kills her and starts drilling the wall. Hearing a noise, Kellin descends into the basement looking for the missing Erica and discovers a dead body and a bloodied Josiah with an explosive in his hand.He is going to blow up the people participating in the celebration and invites the girl to run away. But she tries to stop the villain. Josiah is predictably stronger. The trainee is saved by Erika, who pierces the guy's head with a hammer.Coming out of the basement, Kellin asks Erica if she believes in the curse. The trainee herself is convinced that a person cannot become a monster if he does not initially live in him. She asks the director to give her Josiah's phone, because it was with his help that he was going to bring down the building. Her hunch is correct: Erica took the phone and is going to make an explosion herself and film it all on camera for her new ""masterpiece"". There is a close-up of Campbell with the hat. Kellin takes out a knife and slits Erika's throat. She bleeds out and falls into the pool.Ending vision: A black man wearing a Campbell hat tells the boy, ""Now you're mine, but you won't have my blood or my name."" He shoots at the villain and takes the bottle, filling it with water from the cold river and the blood that got into it.The old man is dying in the hospital. Kellin towers over Erika's dead body in the water.

While their mother goes Christmas shopping, Henrietta gets the children to behave by reading them a story about Alternis, who is compared to all three of the ghosts who appeared to Scrooge. The Christmas spirit uses magic on misbehaving children.At Thatcher Prep Academy, where most of the students are African American, Brandon is a good looking and popular teenager who is the school's basketball star. His mother Tessia is the principal, and she is making announcements over the intercom. Shortly before Christmas, Brandon wants to ask Vanessa, best friend of his future stepsister Emily, to the Yultide Ball (that's how the sign outside the school spells it). He is interrupted by Gregory, and Emily's 10-year-old brother Aiden, who is a science nerd. Gregory is bullying Aiden because of his book, the same one Henrietta is reading, because Aiden still believes in Santa Claus and other fantasies. Aiden has to fish his book out of a trash can.Tessia and her fiance Dr. Joseph Kingsley, and their families, are now living together in a nice house. As the family sit down to a meal, Joseph announces he and Tessia are making it official.Brandon talks to his father on his cell phone, hoping they can get together for Christmas. He does not want to spend the holiday with his new family.Even though his father and Tessia have made it official, Aiden overhears a conversation about Brandon's Aunt Tracie that leads him to believe they are breaking up. Aunt Tracie will be staying for a while and will take Emily's room.Joseph's friend Curtis visits and Joseph promises to set him up with Tracie, but he doesn't promise Curtis will like her.Because of the family's problems Aiden calls on Alternis after mixing the blue stuff and the red stuff hoping it can make him like food he doesn't like. It doesn't work. But Alternis does appear when called. He mixes the blue stuff and the red stuff. He reads a contract as he explains that he will try to make each family member see the point of view of the others.During the night, Aiden ends up in Brandon's body, Brandon ends up in Emily's body and Emily ends up in Aiden's body. They never tell anyone but each other, but each tries to pretend to be whoever's body is being occupied. Brandon is distressed to learn Emily is having her period. Aiden has some uncomfortable feelings of his own but he likes how he looks, especially when he arrives at school.Emily is upset to see Brandon doesn't care about ""her"" appearance, and she helps Brandon to look better.In class, Emily as Aiden is much more confident dealing with ""his"" bullies, but this doesn't help much. Eventually, the teacher decides Gregory and Aiden will work together on the science fair project.Brandon as Emily is uncomfortable when she has to use the girls' restroom for the first time.After school, Emily is distressed to see that Brandon sweated so much in her body in gym class.Back in the ""real world"", the kids are interested in the story their grandmother is reading and want to know more.Alternis goes in the wrong bedroom and frightens Emily as Aiden, who didn't believe in him before, but now she does. Artenis is asked to switch everyone back but he can't do it just yet. The kids have to help each other.Gregory makes it sound like he will let Aiden do all the work on the science project, but Emily as Aiden doesn't know what to do and insists Gregory will do the work.Aiden as Brandon manages to ask Vanessa to the dance, though Brandon as Emily doesn't like this because it is Aiden who is getting the benefit. What if they don't switch back in time?Aiden as Brandon also can't play basketball. Brandon as Emily tries to teach him. Tessia is impressed at how well Emily plays.Aunt Tracie arrives. She has a strong personality and lots of luggage. Emily is having a sleepover with her friends, but she is really Brandon trying to pretend to be Emily. Brandon as Emily wants to talk about boys and learns about their feelings. ""Her"" comments to Vanessa make it sound like ""she"" is attracted to Vanessa. Also, Emily as Aiden shows up and is told girls only. To which Aiden as Emily tells Brandon as Emily that he should leave. Then Aunt Tracie shows up and insists on being a part of the party.The next morning, Brandon as Emily goes back in ""her"" bedroom to find Tracie, a very large woman, in her underwear and not covered up, in ""her"" bed.Over time, each child has to teach the one occupying that person's body what needs to be learned. Brandon must learn history, Aiden must learn basketball, and Emily must learn to do a science project. Jesse is impressed with the new knowledge Emily (Brandon) has and he wants to ask her to the dance.Curtis arrives and spends time with Tracie, and in a sequence with no audio other than music, the adults draw Christmas trees (Tracie's looks like Charlie Brown's) and make gingerbread houses, while the kids teach each other what they need to know.Eventually Curtis has to leave and Tracie can tell he doesn't like her. What's wrong with her?Aiden as Brandon tells his teammates his strategy will be to fool the players on the other team into thinking he can't play very well and then show them what he can do. But he messes up the names of the most famous basketball players.Aiden as Brandon has to play in his first game. One of the coaches finds him in the hall calling himself a loser. The coach tells him he is not a loser and knows he can play and do very well. In fact, the game is a disaster, as Aiden messes up constantly, and the other team wins. Aiden as Brandon is upset regardless of what the family says to encourage him.Emily as Aiden must deal with ""his"" own competition. ""His"" project is not particularly complicated--a simulation of an earthquake--and someone makes fun of such a simple project, but nevertheless ""he"" wins. Aiden as Brandon is distressed at how well his sister imitates him--is THAT how he sounds?The kids have helped each other, so why haven't they changed back?Aiden comments on how much he misses his mother, who has died, and he didn't even remember her that well. Emily says she is hurting too and she did remember her mother. They are getting along better than they have.Aiden as Brandon has one more challenge to get through--the dance. In a brief appearance from the ""real world"" kids thinking the problems have been solved, the grandmother tells the kids no, there;s more.The one thing Aiden as Brandon learned to do right was dance. He is really good. So is Vanessa, who is gorgeous. Brandon as Emily is uncomfortable in ""her"" dress"" even though ""she"" is beautiful too.

He meets Tracie, who is frightened but eventually decides she likes the funny-looking man.The time comes for Tessia to name a king and queen of the dance, the Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus. She reveals that the winners of the vote were Brandon and Vanessa, which upsets the real Brandon further. Back at home, Brandon is still upset but can't explain why. Tracie is drunk and making weird claims.The last straw is the phone conversation between Aiden as Brandon and Brandon's father, who would love to spend the holiday with his son, but he is at a work-related party, and he can't have Brandon for Christmas.

Their mother comes back happy and amazed at how well behaved the kids are. After they leave, the grandmother thinks she sees Alternis.Tracie finds the stuff that was created when Aiden mixed the red stuff and the blue stuff. Just in time, Aiden stops her from drinking it.

Offering rare access inside the first crewed mission launched from U.S. soil since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, this is an intimate portrait of the engineers and astronauts chosen for the historic moment.
Following NASA veterans Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley, and their families in the lead-up to launch, RETURN TO SPACE brings viewers along for their thrilling ride to the International Space Station, and into mission control with Musk and the SpaceX team as they bring them back to Earth for a dramatic splashdown return.Its 2020, and US hasn't flown its astronauts to the Space Station on US rockets for 9 yrs now. Musk believes that humans need to become an interplanetary species. Climate change, meteors or third world war could wipe off life on Earth.
NASA hasn't been back to the moon since 1972, and hence Elon Musk started Space X. he is building a reusable rocket system to help humanity become a multi-planetary species. Bob and Doug are the astronauts chosen by NASA for the Dragon's capsule's first flight to the ISS. They have trained together for 20 yrs.
Safety of the vehicle is top of mind for Elon. in 1986 Chellenger exploded and a similar crash now will be devastating to the US space program. Bob and Doug have been involved with Space X for 5 yrs and have been involved with the design of the spacecraft. They designed the abort system. SpaceX performs an Uncrewed demo of the abort system, where the capsule is supposed to separate from the booster and parachute down back to Earth. The test worksDoug was on the last shuttle flight in 2011, when it was retired after 30 yrs of flight. It was very expensive and dangerous. They had to rely on Russians to launch US astronauts to ISS from 2011. It cost $82 MM per person to launch from Russia. The Florida launchpads were demolished and it looked like human space flight was coming to an end.
Obama announces the policy to reply on Private sector to develop technologies to launch into deep space by 2025, culminating into a landing on MArs. The congress, controlled by the republicans, resisted. Even Niel Armstrong testified against this proposal.Elon Musk was in tears after Niel's testimony. Hans Koenigsmann is the VP of flight reliability at Space X. Hans and Elon know that failure is part of the development. He and Elon met at an amateur rocket meet in 2002. He and Elon build the Falcon rocket in an airport near LA. Elon had money for 3 flights and that's it. Falcon 1 was a 2 stage rocket. 30 secs into the flight, the engine shut down by itself. Space X had worked on it for 4 yrs. A yr later, the second attempt failed. A yr after that, the third launch also failed.
Elon scrapes the money for one more launch. The 4th launch works and Space X achieves orbit, the first private company to do so. Elon wins a $1.5 BN contract from NASA.
Space X takes off, with commercial launches, Satellites and so on. The launches increase every yr. Jeff Bezos gets into the field as well, with Blue Origin. Branson, Bezos and Musk are in the race for NASA contracts to supply the space station.Elon was considered an eccentric billionaire for his antics (random tweets and smoking marijuana on camera). Elon continues working on a reusable rocket. US spent $350 BN since Apollo and send 350 people to space. Thats $ 1 Bn per person. No one has ever tried to land an orbital booster before. SpaceX blow up more rickets along the way to learn new things. SpaceX engineers developed legs, guiding fins and an advanced algorithms to control the burns during descent. They get it right after 7 yrs of testing. Falcon 9 brought the launch costs down to $4K per Kg.2020. and 2 weeks away from the demo-2 launch to ISS. Bob and Doug's wives are both astronauts themselves. One spent 6 months at ISS and the other performed the last service mission on the Hubble. 5 days before launch a successful static fire test is conducted and the rocket passes. Bala Ramamurthy heads flight safety at Space X and the weather is acting up before the launch window. In 2016, the rocket exploded on pad, while being fueled for launch.
On launch day, launch Juju is on full force with the entire Space X team. People get superstitious. Dragon socks, wear red, don't wear red, launch beard, wear green. Space X is go for launch as the weather clears. Its in the middle of Covid 19.
But as the propellant starts the load, the weather moves in again. Launch is postponed. Sat May 30th, the launch is attempted again. This time the astronauts get to space. There are still risks. Docking goes off without a hitch.
Bob and Doug adjust to life in zero gravity. Crew modules, toilets, foods, fluids, sense of direction. Bob turns 50. They perform EVAs. They upgrade the batteries. After 62 days, the dragon capsule Undocks and brings Doug and Bob back home.
In 2003 Columbia burnt up on re-entry. Everything goes perfectly with the dragon capsule and there is splashdown.Saturn V inspired Elon to go to Mars. Space X went into human launches after 80 flights. For Apollo, they had 2 test flights and that's it. The flight to Mars goes through a base on the moon.
One yr later the same capsule takes 4 astronauts to ISS for a 6 months mission. Bob's wife Megan is the pilot on this mission.
SpaceX is working on the star-ship with the goal of going to the moon.","Offering rare inside access to NASA and SpaceX, this is the thrilling story of the nearly 20 year journey to send American astronauts back to space aboard U.S. rockets, from filmmakers Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin."

Its lush territory transformed into subdivisions. A paradise - vanishing into thin air.Perched on the edge of extinction, the panther is an emblem of our once connected world. A vision of what could be again. Or else, a harbinger of what could befall our planet, if the 'Path of the Panther' becomes a dead end.This odyssey of hope and heartbreak is the culmination of more than five years of field research, half-a-million still images, and over 800 hours of ultra high definition camera trap footage. Against all odds, wild panthers have been stunningly captured in their native ecosystem, as they've never been filmed before.These wide-ranging apex predators, one of the most elusive and endangered wild cats in the world, are also the inspiration for a visionary idea: a wildlife corridor. It's the beginning of a wild 'path' that could one day stretch into every corner of the American continent.What began as a moonshot photo and film mission is evolving into a 'Path of the Panther' movement. This groundbreaking collaboration with National Geographic Society and other partners inspired the passage of the Florida Wildlife Corridor Act - the first legislation of its kind and a blueprint for addressing habitat fragmentation and species extinction across the globe.Today, the movement continues to grow.

Realizing that technology and software have made it impossible for people to connect, a notable inventor Ward (Martin Landau), creates a drug which allows people to connect by living in their dreams. Over the course of 20 years, half the world ends up on the drug, and a one-world government called Contractualism, forms.In Contractualism everyone must follow their contract. If your contract doesn't specifically say you can do something, you can't. The only way to break the law is to breech the contract. The penalty for breach of contract is death. 50% of the world's population ends up on the drug, while 25% of the world becomes the Union of United Esquires; lawyers with guns that control everything. The other 25% must continue living their regular lives as is.For 20 years people all over the world live in their wildest dreams doing whatever their mind can conjure up, until Ward dies and the drug is longer available, since contractually, Ward was the only person that could make it. With the drug gone, but the contracts still in place, The Druggies (the 50% of the population that had taken the drug) are under house arrest because their contracts don't specifically say they can go outside. Faced with death for breaching their contracts, everyone obeys, except for one family's oldest son, Garp (Michael Gladis), who had no desire to comply with his contract. Driven by his longing to satisfy his sexual needs while trying to fulfill his dream, Garp attempts to a girl across the street, Scout (Alexis Dziena) naked through her window. What starts as simple mission, turns into a deep, quirky, and emotional journey for connection. Just like Ward had wanted. At its core, WITHOUT WARD is about one man who saves the entire world, by standing naked in his window.","Inventor creates drug that allows people to live in their wildest dreams. Now, the drug is no more, and everyone who was on it is under house arrest. Garp learns to connect with himself, and in that, to take action."

It is about a dark and difficult masterpiece and the deeply gifted and flawed people who made it. It is about New York in a troubled era of cultural ferment and social change. It is about an era that made a movie and a movie that made an era.
The 1969 movie tells the story of two homeless loners who join forces out of desperation and struggle to survive. It features superb performances by Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight, spirited direction by John Schlesinger, a brilliant screenplay by blacklist survivor Waldo Salt, and a memorable musical soundtrack. The result was the only X-rated film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture and John Schlesinger's win as Best Director over George Roy Hill, Arthur Penn, Sydney Pollack and Costa-Gavras! It paved the way for a generation's worth of gritty, New York-based movies with adult themes and complex characters.
A half century after its release, Midnight Cowboy remains one of the most original and groundbreaking movies of the modern era. It is set in a New York besieged by economic collapse, social unrest, and cultural upheaval in the midst of Black, gay and women's liberation movements. It heralded the coming of age of Hollywood - a time when risk-taking movies flourished, old rules were shattered, and a new breed of filmmakers took on adult themes and troubled characters never before seen in mainstream films. We look at Midnight Cowboy's moment and why this movie resonates so powerfully more than fifty years later.","Follows the behind-the-scenes odyssey to get Midnight Cowboy (1969) produced, as well as the tumultuous era in which the movie was released and embraced."

Sensitive to supernatural spirits, Claire additionally suffers from intermittent visions of violent ghosts, causing her to sleep in her closet for her safety and sanity.Claire's boss at Child Protective Services, Lloyd, assigns Claire to investigate the suspected abuse of a young girl named Sophie Lang. While interviewing Sophie and her parents, Giles and Audrey, Claire observes paranormal activity in the family's home. After seeing a woman's ghost during one of her sudden trances, Claire concludes a supernatural entity is responsible for Sophie's injuries, but is unsure how to handle the case since Lloyd and Sophie's school would not believe the truth.The ghostly woman seemingly slaps Sophie, locks her in her closet, and trashes her room. In a subsequent interview with the girl, Sophie tells Claire that her father Giles had an affair while Audrey was pregnant with her. Lloyd continues pressuring Claire to close the seemingly straightforward case.During a family dinner, the ghost contorts Audrey's hand and forces it down on a knife blade. While Giles insists on taking his wife to the hospital, Audrey only questions him about his affair from several years earlier.With the paranormal activity growing more violent, Audrey asks Claire if she could use her ability to communicate with the ghost to get it to leave. Claire ends up choked unconscious when she experiences a vision in the family's bathroom of a woman killing her husband with a sewing needle and then slashing her wrists in grief upon seeing their dead son on the floor.When she wakes in the hospital, Claire learns her ex-husband Peter sat with her for an entire day. Ada, an elderly woman later revealed to be another ghost, talks to Claire about unfairly blaming yourself for another person's death and the need to heal broken relationships.

Lloyd fires Claire.Claire visits her son's ghost in the field where he was found after being killed by a hit-and-run driver. The experience compels Claire to give up her prescription meds, which she blames for making her miss a scheduled pickup that forced Lucas to walk home from school when he was killed. Claire also moves out of the closet and back into her bed.As the final step in dealing with her grief and finally moving forward, Claire calls Peter to say she wants to start over. Peter agrees to renew their relationship.The woman's ghost attacks Claire in her home. A flashback shows Claire that the distraught woman killed her husband and then herself after discovering her husband murdered their son. Another flashback shows that Audrey had been abusing Sophie all along, and the ghost was merely trying to protect the girl.Claire rushes to the Lang family's house with the woman's ghost guiding her. Claire finds Audrey holding Giles at gunpoint while Sophie cowers in fear. As Giles pleads that Audrey needs mental help, Audrey expresses long-held resentment over his affair, which she blames for destroying her life. Audrey admits she abuses Sophie, and she threatens to shoot their daughter in order to take away what Giles loves most.Claire physically intervenes, inadvertently causing Audrey to kill Giles instead of Audrey. Claire and Audrey wrestle over the gun as Audrey continues firing wildly. Audrey ends up falling down the stairs.Hearing the gunshots, the neighbors call 911. Peter and his police officer partner Beckett respond to the call.Claire tries to sneak out of the house with Sophie, but Audrey suddenly stabs her. With Audrey continuing to attack, Claire asks the ghost for help. The ghost contorts Audrey's limbs in different directions until she drops dead.

Solomon was born blind and Nidia teaches him as the pair forage for food and supplies provided by the woods around them, he uses a rope tethered to his waist so that he never loses his way home; she provides her son with three rules: 1. The house is a safe haven, 2. To always give back part of what they scavenge in the forest, and 3. To never under any circumstances remove the rope from his waist as it is his guide back home. One night, after Nidia develops a strange cough, she leaves and is never seen again.Approximately ten years pass as Solomon becomes a young man, living on his own after presuming his mother and father are both dead. One day, he happens upon a hunter named Henry, a good-hearted man who requests he stay with Solomon through the night. As he learns more about Solomon, Henry begins to care for his well being and decides to help him with supplies and thinking about a way to get Solomon out of the forest, despite his protestations to leaving. As the days pass, the two become friends and after offering to help him build a tool which requires a chain that Solomon had seen in the woods as a boy, the pair set out. He allows Henry to extend his tether so the two can venture further. After finding the chain and cutting it the pair experience a supernatural roaring that night at the cabin. When Henry goes to investigate, he is nearly attacked by a strange figure in the woods after noticing that it had ripped a small bear apart. He urges Solomon to stop throwing food into the woods, breaking his mother's second rule, to try and dissuade this creature from coming back. Meanwhile, he discovers Nidia's journals which start out pleasant enough, but soon grow volatile as she suspects her husband Lucas of trying to take Solomon away from her. The next day, Henry strikes out on his own to find this creature and uncovers a second journal; this one repeating ""I'm so sorry"" over and over as the writing becomes scribbles, then scrawling, then incoherent as he reads through the pages.Solomon hears Henry's gun go off and rushes to find him, he reaches the end of his tether, and removes it from his waist. Crawling a short distance down a nearby gully, he discovers Henry's body. Before he can process what he's found, the creature emerges; his mother, now devoid of human emotion stalks toward him with demonic eyes. All Solomon can do is hum a lullaby they used to sing together, she hums along and he recognizes her. Embracing Solomon, he instinctively stabs her with his pocket knife, killing her. Solomon begins to cough and collapses beside a tree, and as the sounds of nature swells around him, his blank, white eyes soon grow a set of pointed pupils, much like his mother's new eyes had looked.","In the film set miles from civilization, a blind teenager and the hunter he befriends are tormented by a mysterious creature lurking in the woods."

Bellino'],"Young people will always be attracted to live concerts. And bands, promoters, and concert venues will always be tempted to cut corners for cheap spectacle. The Guest List remains timely, years after the Station Fire tragedy, because nightclub fires remain a hazard (witness recent club fires in Argentina, Russia, Thailand, Brazil, and even Oakland, California). Less a fire safety polemic than character study, The Guest List is largely based on John Barylick's narrative non-fiction work, Killer Show, The Station Nightclub Fire, America's Deadliest Rock Concert, (University Press of New England, 2012). Critically praised by non-fiction authors Vincent Bugliosi (Helter Skelter) and Ralph Nader (Unsafe at Any Speed), Killer Show tells the compelling stories of the Station Fire - including those on Jack Russell's ""guest list.""On February 20, 2003 America's deadliest rock concert began in West Warwick, Rhode Island, when a heavy metal band, Great White, ignited pyrotechnics inside a run-down roadhouse. The resulting conflagration killed 100 persons and grievously injured many others. The Guest List looks at the aftermath of that tragedy, exploring the culture of rock music and its associated celebrity, with their potential to both harm and heal.The target audiences for The Guest List are rock music fans and, more generally, fans of disaster non-fiction (between whom there is substantial overlap). Rock audiences will be fascinated by behind-the-scenes stories of a band, and lead singer, heading downhill on a third-rate tour where negligence and greed trumped safety. Disaster buffs will be riveted by the cruel irony of acceptance onto Jack Russell's guest list, as they'll be inspired by Joe Kinan's courage, and even humor, in the face of horrific challenges.The Guest List addresses timeless themes of personal responsibility, acceptance, and forgiveness. Its central characters struggle to cope in the aftermath of tragedy - some gracefully, and some less so. It is an object lesson in the tragic potential of poor decisions. The Guest List is a strikingly visual story. No one who watches The Guest List will enter a concert venue again without first checking for the exits.",The Guest List is a film about the lives affected and forever connected by one of the most horrific tragedies in music history. The Station nightclub fire remains America's deadliest rock concert.

With the recent passing of her dad, her mom Sandy and Grampa Bill struggled to make ends meet. Jodie is always so positive and never let things get her down. Her life's dream is to be normal like the other kids. Jodie's love for horses is always foremost on her mind, constantly hoping someday she can ride. However, with her physical disability, this seemed quite unlikely.
17-year-old Bridgett Van Heusen lives on a magnificent estate with her mom Victoria and father Stephen. She has a beautiful championship horse, Barkley. She also has a full-time equestrian coach/trainer, Jimmy Campbell. Jimmy carries a deep pain from the tragedy of losing his wife and daughter. Bridgett is constantly competing in horse shows and wins many awards. Victoria drives Bridgett and Jimmy relentlessly, creating anger and stress in Bridget's life. Jimmy is working with Bridget, not only with horses, but teaching her about life.
Jodie and her family attend a local horseshow that Bridgett is competing in. After the show, which Bridget wins, Jodie and her family go to the stable area to meet Bridget and see her beautiful horse, Barkley. Strong, belittling words from Victoria directed towards Jodie's disability breaks Jodie's heart and angers her family. Days later, another meeting at the local feed store between Bridgett and Jodie again ends with Jodie getting her heart broken.
Good news from a top surgeon has Jodie and her family very excited. A new medical procedure gives Jodie a great chance of walking normal again. Jodie gets the procedure and after a hospital stay, attends Helping Hooves rehabilitation complex which uses horses for rehab and therapy.
Bridgett overhears a devastating statement from her father as they entertained friends ""I always wanted a son, a true air, all I got was...."" Bridget bursts out of the shadows ""ME"". She is devastated, runs and grabs Jimmy's saddled up training horse and gallops off at breakneck speed through the woods. A tree crashes on the trail, and a terrible fall from her horse leaves Bridget severely injured. The riderless horse gallops back to the stable area. Jimmy spots the horse and panics. He grabs a four-wheeler and charges through the woods, finding a crumpled, unconscious Bridget. An ambulance rushes Bridgett to the hospital. After surgery and during her hospital stay, Bridgett meets Jodie in the hospital rehab area. Jodie's positive attitude touches Bridget. After some time, Bridget also ends up at Helping Hooves rehabilitation center.
Helping Hooves is such a positive place with great results. With both attending, Jodie and Bridget slowly, oh so slowly begin to form a friendship. Jimmy is the middle person, constantly working with both girls. Jodie's health progresses rapidly and Bridget is having many physical problems. With the fall state championship horseshow on the horizon, Bridget realizes she will not be able to compete. She convinces Jimmy and Jodie that Jodie should take Barkley and compete in her place. They don't tell Victoria. The three began a vigorous, demanding training program with Jimmy and Bridget working with Jodie. Working through setbacks, tears and discouragement, slowly Jodie develops into a first-class rider.
The State Championship horse show day arrives. The tense competition begins, with Barkley and Jodie performing flawlessly. Jodie ends up winning the event. Tears and joy overwhelm everyone. Jodie and Bridget spend an alone moment together with a tearful hug. Jimmy grabs Jodie and they join the championship celebration. Bridget stands aside with her walking cane, watching the happiness and joy. A lady walking by stops beside Bridget. ""You must be so proud. Is Jodie your sister""? Bridget thinks a moment, looking over at a happy Jodie. Bridget smiles ""Yes, yes she is"". The lady continues ""Do you ride""? With a sad smile Bridget reply ""Once upon a time"".
The movie was filmed in Vermont during the spectacular foliage season, giving it an added dimension in the Cinematography department!","This story is about two teenage girls with totally different backgrounds. One girl, Jodie Brown was born with a physical disability. She and her mother live on a run down old farm. With the recent passing of her dad, Jodie's mother Sandy, works two jobs to make ends meet. Jodie's dream is to own and ride a horse and even eventually compete in a horse show. However, physical and financial problems make this quite impossible. Being bullied and made fun of is an every day part of her life. The other girl, Bridgett Van Heusen, lives a complete opposite life. She lives on a beautiful farm and has her own horse. She is very spoiled, wanting for nothing. Her dad is on the road most of the time earning money for their lavish lifestyle. Her mom's life consists of going from committee meeting to committee meeting. Both parents are involved in everything but their daughter's life. Bridgett has her own horse trainer and caretaker. She competes in district and national horse shows with much success. She does not appreciate what she has and is mean and belittling to all. These two girls path's cross and the story follows the success of one and the failure of the other. It has many emotional turns and twists. The story also has life lessons. It is a family story which will touch all ages.—Don Miller"

Farley) decides to tell the story from the beginning.
Brothers Genie Moe (John Farley) and Genie Joe Genie have been cooped up inside a lamp for over 347 years. Moe is five wishes away from his planned retirement in Cabo. Joe enjoys granting wishes and has no plans to retire. The brothers begin to argue and their disagreement explodes into a pillow fight.
Meanwhile Benji Becker (Nick Fisher) is reading a comic book when his brother Drew Becker (Liam Kelman) attempts to order him to help rehearse his magic act. Their older sister Emma Becker (Riley Jackson) is nearby recording their disagreement to show their mother. Upset with the lack of
cooperation from his brother, Drew decides to split their bedroom marking it off with a roll of tape. Coincidently, Moe and Joe are doing the same thing inside their bottle.The kids are in the kitchen waiting for their mother to return from grocery shopping. Benji is trying to convince Emma to allow him to have a cookie just before their mother Melanie (Elisa Eliot) returns. The kids are suspicious that Melanie did more than grocery shop having been gone three hours. Melanie admits she made another stop and decides to give Drew his birthday present immediately. She reveals a new puppy. Emma is immediately envious. Melanie than reveals that she invited Drew's former friend Lucas (Brady Bond), his brother Ryder (Hunter Payton) and his dad Paul Martin (Brent Huff) over for dinner that evening for Drew's birthday party. Emma believes her mother is using Drew's birthday as just another reason to see Lucas's father. Melanie suggests Drew and Emma take the new dogs for a walk while she prepares for the party.Outside, Emma and Drew's neighbor Mrs. Crabtree (Shelia Oaks) is less than thrilled her neighbors have a dog believing it will dig up her flowers. Just then Jeanie (Laura Marano), Mrs. Crabtree's granddaughter, pulls up in a convertible van. Jeanie has failed to gain acceptance to beauty school but continues to advertise her makeover and hairstyling business. Inspired by the new puppy, Jeanie adds pet grooming to the advertising sign on her van.Inside the lamp, Moe is annoyed at the noise Joe is making while playing a video game. He pulls the plug on the TV which is on his side of the line in the floor.In the park, Drew is a bit disappointed that the puppy does not respond to his commands and will not be able to be his magician's assistant for his upcoming talent show. Emma asks Drew what he intends to name the puppy, offering several puny suggestions. Drew decides to name the dog Magic. Magic begins digging in the ground. It rocks the brother's lamp and Moe's magic wish vial slides to Joe's side of the lamp. The genies are both excited the lamp has been discovered but without the vial, Moe can only grant three wishes and will not be able to retire. Still feuding, Joe refuses to return the vial to Moe. Emma and Drew recover the lamp from the ground. As Drew cleans the lamp, Drew wishes that little Magic was really magical. Genie Joe is sucked out of the lamp and becomes Magic's persona.At the party. Lucas's father Paul Martin has brought another guest, a boy named Oliver (Merrick Hanna) who is staying with Lucas and his family while his parents are out of town. Lucas and his older brother Ryder tease Lucas about being wimpy. The conversation steers toward the upcoming talent show. Oliver declares that he has created an act that has nothing to do with magic. Lucas, formerly Drew's assistant, declares at dinner that he is performing his own magic act for the talent show. Lucas excuses himself to get more water and brings Oliver along to go to the kitchen. There the boys discover the lamp in Drew's backpack. Lucas believes it is part of Drew's top secret magic trick. Despite Oliver's protests, Lucas decides to steal the lamp. Then he squashes Drew's magic hat themed birthday cake and puts frosting on Magic so the dog will be blamed for the incident. At cake time, Melanie discovers the smashed cake and blames Benji, but Benji has never left the table.

appears. Melanie explains that she is going to teach her aerobics class before she goes to spend time with Paul. The kids are left to babysit Benji and serve him his lunch.

Magic runs off with the kids trailing behind. Moe tells Wendell he can receive infinite wishes if he is able to capture the dog which confuses Wendell. A frenzied chase ensues as Joe leads the kids down the street, through an optician's storefront, acrossthe park to a playground where Magic takes them up and down a slide and Magic makes a basket with his nose on the basketball court. They all finally find an empty storage room in a park shelter to hide in.Safe inside, Joe explains he ran when he saw his brother. Joe tells the kids his brother is mad because he took Moe's wish granting abilities with him when he ended up inside Magic and Moe intends to keep Joe inside the lamp forever. Joe says his wish granting ability is often misdirected and perhaps accepting his fate is for the best. Drew and the kids tell Joe not to give up and that magic is about the impossible becoming possible. They resolve to get back the lamp in order to make the situation right.As the kids, leave the storage room, they are observed by Wendell and Moe who quickly follow.

Wendell explains he had no intention of keeping their dog but needed him to get more than infinite wishes. Wendell also discloses that the lamp is missing. The kids immediately know that Ryder has it.Ryder is inside his bedroom. He rubs the lamp and summons the genie. Ryder silences Moe until he can formulate his wish. Meanwhile, Lucas theorizes that Ryder probably took the lamp home. Ryder wishes for $100 million in a Swiss bank account, but Moe tells Ryder that the wish belongs to Wendell who originally freed him from the lamp. Ryder resolves that there are other ways to get money out of a genie in a lamp. Ryder rubs the lamp forcing Moe inside and then advertises the genie lamp for sale on the internet. After a couple of responses calling Ryder a scammer or offering an alien in trade, Ryder get an offer to meet the buyer on a hangar at the airport with a cash offer of $1million if Ryder can prove the lamp is authentic. Ryder puts the lamp in a box and then in his back pack and leaves on his bicycle.Lucas, Emma, Oliver, Drew, Benji and Joe arrive at Lucas's house.

Mr. M demands proof of the genie. Just then the kids arrive. Jeanie and Pickles plan to provide a distraction as the kids plot to recover the lamp. Ryder rubs the lamp and produces the genie. Mr. M pokes Moe confirming him as real. Jeanie bursts in wearing aviator sunglasses and declares that Mr. M's plane will have to be inspected before departure. This allows Joe and the kids to sneak in the other end of the hangar. Moe sees Joe and the kids sneak in but remains silent. Drew wishes Ryder had donuts and he is suddenly covered by large inflatable donuts. Lucas activates the remote control and the lamp disappears inside the vanishing box.Mr. M realizes Jeanie's inspection is absurd and heads back toward Ryder.

In an effort to save his brother, Joe leaps to knock the lamp away from Ryder but is knocked in the head in the process and falls motionless to the floor.Emma pronounces the dog is dead. Even Ryder is remorseful. Drew, however, says not to give up and believe the impossible is possible. Wendell is reminded he still has one more wish. Wendell wishes that Joe is okay. Moe grants the wish and a few seconds later Joe jumps to his feet. Joe says to Moe that he is sorry he took Moe's magic vial and asks what is worth having him as a brother.

Surely his was an ordinary life made of work, family and love. The only element he had diverted to normality up to that point had been the death of his wife.
Steven begins to isolate himself more and more and begins to live his life in the small bedroom with bathroom.
His daughter, Lizzie, assists him in every free moment of the day, trying to shake him and make him regain his happiness.
Her presence is constant, at times suffocating, and her good intentions are not read as such by Steven who prefers to have a world of his own rather than continue to live his life as a paralytic.
An apparent calm chaos destined to erupt upon entering of Luka in the house. A young boy, perhaps too young, introverted and silent. His role is to take care of Steven during the night, taking over from the housekeeper.
Luka immediately shows himself to be an impeccable worker, trying to do his best to carry out his duties.
Steven is attracted by his silences and his ""not annoying"" way of working. In total contrast with Lezzie.
Steven's interest increases day by day, as does Luka's attention to his ""master"". Between the two begins to establish a particular alchemy that will lead Steven himself to dismiss his housekeeper and to spend all his days with the boy.
The background to this constant growth of relationships is a heavy economic crisis experienced by Steven. The house is auctioned and sold by a young couple. The two new owners meet Steven more than once, gently inviting him to leave the house, which is no longer his property. Steven resists, despite the start of the renovations and the rubble that falls repeatedly during the days. Luka and Steven transform that small bedroom with bathroom into their miniature apartment.
Lezzie, unaware of all this, fears that the young caregiver is generating plagiarism to her father with the intent of cutting the rest of the world out of her life. What actually happens is the exact opposite. Steven, projected to live in his comfort zone, totally alienating himself as an individual within society, slowly leads the boy to make the same choices as him. The turning point in the situation will take place after a second stroke by Steven that will make him almost totally paralyzed and helpless in Luka's hands.
There is now no escape for the two. Their refuge is no longer safe. It is not possible to live long without electricity and without water. The only solution for not leaving the room, which inevitably coincides with separating, will be the most extreme one, which will allow him to stay together, despite everything ""forever!""","Steven suffers a brain stroke.

This would be the home of the pilots, and ground crews of the 227th Aviation Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, for the next 15 months of ""The Surge."" Weather permitting, air crews were in the air 24 hours a day, every day, in support of the ever expanding ground operations. There were no routine missions, every time a crew would go up, they would be facing an evolving and increasingly deadly enemy.An Najaf, one of the holiest cities in Shi'a Islam and the location, Diya Abdul Zahra Kadim has chosen for a fortified compound - with the goal of controlling the city. Kadim's 200 followers, ""The Soldiers of Heaven"" are highly trained and armed fighters, they are supported by another 200 conscripts.

In what can only be described as a modern day Alamo, the Soldiers of D Company were in a fight for their lives, as the call for help went out. An Apache team was only seven minutes away - the longest seven minutes of their lives!The mission was just an orientation flight with another unit, that is, until the intelligence briefing.

And so it goes for Nicole who, just as she is in a position to move on with life after finalizing a divorce with Jake, receives a phone call from her mother: the entirety of her shitty family is coming to stay for Thanksgiving weekend. But maybe this time will be different. After all, Nicole is enjoying newfound success, both in her career and in her new relationship with Braeden, the charming man she has begun seeing. With life finally looking up for once, perhaps she will feel empowered to deal with her family. She needs that strength too, because they are still oblivious to the fact that she is now divorced from her ex-husband, Jake. Nicole has put off telling them because she knows how that conversation will go. Her mother is a master champion of passive-aggressiveness, each word coming out of her mouth a calculated dagger. Plus, her sister, Debra, does her part to remain in their mother's favor, which means looking down her nose at Nicole as often as possible. Making up the rest of the visiting family is Debra's husband, Todd, who seems to share a brain with Debra. And with these people coming for the weekend, the topic of divorce will be unavoidable. Conversations with this horrendous family are always fun, but with all of them staying at Nicole's house, it will be an unrelenting four-day torture marathon.Meanwhile, Jake is not ready to let Nicole go, as demonstrated through displays of patheticness, obsessiveness, and creepiness ranging from cheese-puff-stained fingerprints on tube socks up to full-blown stalker behavior. But not only is Nicole beyond done with Jake, she is getting closer with Braeden, a person with a dark and bloody secret: he is, in fact, a serial killer. As Nicole and Braeden get more comfortable with one another, Braeden struggles with the idea that perhaps Nicole is the one who will accept him for who he really is. His mask starts to slip, and so far, Nicole hasn't run away. Braeden wonders if he should take the mask off completely and clue her in to the fact that he enjoys random homicidal expeditions. Meanwhile, Jake's obsessiveness only grows more desperate, and this desperation and propensity toward creepy stalking leads him to see more of Braeden's secret life than perhaps he should have.By the time Nicole's family arrives, Jake's obsession and Braeden's pining come to a head in the form of the most awkward Thanksgiving ever. Yes, Nicole will be enjoying dinner with her abusive mother, ridiculous sister, and nincompoop brother-in-law, along with the creepy ex and her serial killer beau. However, it is not an accident that these people ended up sitting at the same table. Nicole pulled their strings in a plot to give them what they all deserve and to finally be free. From the family's perspective, the dinner starts off like normal. That is to say, they get their passive-aggressive digs in, narcissistically drone on about their own nonsense, and create the annoying and aggravating type of atmosphere in which they thrive. But as things progress, filters are removed, motivations revealed, and the craziness escalates with each passing moment. Just when the family thinks learning of Nicole's divorce is the most horrific thing that they can hear, they discover knives aren't just for carving turkeys, that someone at the table brought a surprise, and they learn the hard way just how much Braeden loves gravy. Sometimes freedom converges with vengeance and violence.","In order to move on with her life, a woman must face her sh*tty family, a creepy ex and a serial killer."

Sets the all-time NCAA scoring record. Becomes a national phenomenon. She turns professional. Is named the WNBA Rookie-of-the-Year. And then Jackie Stiles.....disappears.This is the story of a 5'8"" girl from a small Kansas town, population 600, who became a basketball legend in the Midwest. Against all odds, Jackie became the all-time leading scorer in NCAA history. A record she held for 16 years. This feat was accomplished through hard work and unwavering determination. Her coaches and teammates agree that Jackie's work ethic will probably never be matched.Even though schools like UConn and Tennessee offered Jackie basketball scholarships she chose to play at small-Missouri State University, known as SMS at the time. Jackie's father, Pat, a successful High School coach, told Jackie that if she picked SMS she would never be an All-American or go to the Final Four. To Pat's delight, she did both!Jackie lead SMS to the Final Four beating teams like Rutgers, Duke and Washington in the Big Dance. When Jackie fouled out in the Washington game, the Washington fans gave her a standing ovation. When SMS played the favored Duke, Jackie was guarded by future 2-time WNBA Defensive Player of the Year, Alana Beard. Jackie dropped 41 points.After being drafted 4th in the 2001 WNBA Draft, Jackie went on to become the Rookie-of-the-Year for the Portland Fire. Unfortunately her professional career was cut short due to injuries. Many believe the injuries were due to all the wear and tear on her body because of her intense workouts throughout her life.Jackie has beat numerous opponents throughout her career but now she is facing her biggest challenge. In 2017, Jackie was diagnosed with Ocular Melanoma cancer in her eye. This form of cancer can be fatal, but if anyone can beat this, it's Jackie.Jackie is a inspiration, role model and a great ambassador for Women's basketball and the WNBA.Loyola-Marymount head coach, Charity Elliot, said ""The Story of Jackie Stiles is.....Anything is Possible!""",It follows a girl from a small Kansas town as she becomes a basketball legend in the Midwest.

With no family able to take him in, he quickly becomes a ward of the state. Shuffled from one foster home to another, he endures physical, emotional and even sexual abuse at the hands of foster parents and siblings. Eventually, Jonathan is incarcerated after anger and hatred take over his soul. He despises the world for his pain and the bad hand he's been dealt. At seventeen, Jonathan is released to another foster home for the summer where he meets a mysterious girl in the woods nearby who teaches him about faith and forgiveness. As the summer goes on he begins to fall in love, only to learn that she's had a tragedy of her own...and harbors an unbelievable secret.Reviews: All of us who've experienced the trauma of a devastating loss in our lives , as the character Jon has, should have someone like Isaka to guide them through.I not only enjoyed the story very much, but I like that it's written with a focus on providing inspiration to anybody who is looking to strengthen their faith in a Higher Being, particularly, after suffering such a tragedy. ""FORGIVEN GOD"" is highly inspirational and thought-provoking ( as in it opens your eyes )Jon and Isaka are two characters you wont soon forget. Great job by the author! ~BWI thought it was a great book. It keeps your interest. It also keeps you in suspense while teaching you about life and delivering a great spiritual message. So glad I bought it to read and have. It's a amazing story. ~Pamela JonesI was hooked on ""Forgiving God,"" from the first sentence. It is not an easy story. The main character has been through so much, but his journey and the mystery of the Native American girl who comes into his life are entwined in such an uplifting way that the reader is comforted no matter what they have been through themselves.Rich with action and faith, this book is a Christian tale. There is no mistaking that. Being a Pagan, myself, I did not find this off-putting. It's refreshing to see someone sharing their faith through their work in a sweet, respectful manner. I recommend this story to anyone who appreciates a spiritual/religious tale written with love. ~Jess","Jon Moore, orphaned at 9 and raised in an abusive foster system, learns about faith and forgiveness from a mysterious girl he meets while placed in a final foster home.

tt12405432,39,10,1,4.5,['Documentary'],['american'],https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1713161241/,[],"['Aviva Kempner', 'Ben West']","Imagining the Indian: The Fight Against Native American Mascoting is a feature-length documentary film that examines the movement to eliminate the use of Native American slurs, names, logos, images and gestures that many Native Americans and their allies and demeaning and offensive.
The film investigates the impact that caricatures like Chief Wahoo -- the cartoonish logo of the Cleveland Indians -- gestures like the Atlanta Braves' ""tomahawk chop"" and epithets like the Washington ""Redskins"" have on the Native community, the sports community and society in general.Imagining the Indian explores the genesis of the exploitation of Native American culture in competitive sports, including the use of names and logos featuring Indians that have been adopted by teams and franchises with no apparent connection to the tribes and peoples whose cultures they are appropriating. It introduces the audience to Suzan Shown Harjo, President of the Morning Star Institute and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, whose 50-year fight against the exploitation of American Indians in the sports world is used as a lens through which to investigate the history of this issue. The film provides an account of the genocidal history of Native peoples on this continent, and its role in proliferating negative stereotyping in sports, movies and television.A range of opinions are explored among Natives and non-Natives, including the staunch and steadfast opposition exhibited by Harjo and her contemporaries in advocacy over the years, including National Museum of the American Indian director Kevin Gover (Pawnee), elected Tribal Council of the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation chairman Marshall McKay and Autry National Center of the American West CEO W. Richard West, Jr (Southern Cheyenne). The film also includes the opinions of those who do not consider the use of names, logos, mascots or gestures a concern and examines their justification of those views.The documentary surveys the legal history of the movement, including multiple lawsuits led by Harjo and others over decades of activism, most notably a case involving the ""Redskins"" that has made headlines over the last 30 years.Imagining the Indian delves into the contentious battle over that National Football League team's nickname in the nation's capital that has long been at the epicenter of this issue, and been a flash-point for Native advocacy on the matter. In a changing cultural climate, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and Washington owner Snyder have faced mounting pressure to establish a dialogue with Indian activists and communities and ultimately and an alternative name for the team.The film answers why the NFL has not changed its stance on this topic while electing to take on other issues of social justice, such as domestic violence, criminal justice and LGBT rights. Imagining the Indian also examines Washington owner Dan Snyder's out- reach to American Indians as supporters, which includes building play- grounds for economically disadvantaged tribes and recognizing members before football game crowds.The film traces the etymology of ""redskin"" from its birth in 19th century newspaper advertisements -- specifying the reward money for every ""redskin sent to purgatory,"" which differed depending on the county or territory in which the Indian had been murdered, and traditionally scalped -- to the launch of Washington's franchise in the 1930s. It will examine the story of William ""Lone Star"" Dietz, the team's second coach, a German man who claimed to be Sioux and prompted the franchise to change its name from the Boston Braves to the Redskins in 1937.The film shows the viewer what motivates those who fought to erase depictions of Native Americans in sports, as well as those who are determined to hold onto such names and images as sports fans. It details name and mascot-change campaigns that have been successful at high school and collegiate levels, including Stanford, Dartmouth, North Dakota and Miami of Ohio. Conversely, the film looks into movements like the Honor the Chief Society, an organization of University of Illinois students and alumni who object to the university's retirement of former mascot ""Chief Illiniwek"" and seek to keep its memory alive.Imagining the Indian investigates why the erasure of Native names from collegiate athletics has not translated to professional sports. It answers how a defined epithet became the name of one of the most recognizable, beloved and financially successful sports franchises in the world. It explores whether brand recognition is more important than cultural sensitivity in the halls and offices of the world's highest-grossing professional sports organization. It asks how the NFL states a moral and ethical obligation to ban a slur for African-Americans on the one hand, but refuses to extend that belief to the nickname of its Washington franchise defined as a racial epithet.The film assesses the position of the American Indian community in moving this cause forward by answering: Does there need to be a moral consensus among Native peoples before the majority of American citizens consider this an actionable cause, as a lack of consensus is an oft-cited argument by dissenters? Is the Indian community at all complicit in the slow progress of this movement? How does the lack of Indian representation in sports and entertainment, both in front of and behind the camera, skew the perception of this controversy as an issue of social justice? How has the historical marginalization of this small segment of the American population influenced the opinions of both Natives and non-Natives on this matter?Critically, Imagining the Indian reviews what is at stake for the people and communities who are demeaned by imagery considered offensive, which is born out in research by academics in the film like Dr. Amy West that finds such imagery creates negative psychological effects on American Indian people, particularly youth.The film also looks at why D.C.'s large African-American fan base, which includes highly visible and influential fans like award-winning actors and native Washingtonians Jeffrey Wright and Taraji P. Henson, hasn't allied with Native American protesters. It will address academic literature that suggests the proliferation of stereotypical Native American imagery in sports promulgates stereotyping and derogatory labeling of other minority cultures, particularly those of color. Cultural leaders in the D.C. African American community, like poet Ethelbert Miller and hip-hop artist HeadRoc, address the phenomenon.In addition, Imagining the Indian chronicles what is a misunderstood momentum to end to Native American mascoting with interviews of people from myriad backgrounds, including Congresspersons Eleanor Holmes-Norton and Deb Haaland, professional Native athletes Bronson Koenig and Ryan Helsley, and national sportswriters including Christine Brennan.Lastly, the film looks forward at political activism among Generation Z, which appears to have a new worldview not only about issues including gun control and climate change, but stereotyping in sports as well. It is with this idea in mind that the documentary will express optimism that as these younger people become the policy makers of the future, the fight against mascoting in sports, entertainment, and beyond, may be won once and for all.The goal of Imagining the Indian is to provide answers to the aforementioned questions in a fair manner, and provide the viewer with a better understanding of the history and significance of this movement in today's social and political landscape.","Explores the exploitation of Native American culture in sports, including the use of names and logos that have been adopted by teams and franchises with no apparent connection to the tribes and peoples whose cultures they appropriate."

The hotel burned several times and was rebuilt. George H. W. Bush and his wife have stayed there. The current owners are George Kutlenios, who served in Congress for 10 years until he was defeated by the ""blue wave"" of 2008, and his wife Chrissy. The hotel is apparently a real place in a real town, because George and Chrissy Kutlenios are listed as executive producers, and the closing credits show other evidence.The fictional version of the hotel's story begins with many people eating a fine meal served by cheerful, formally dressed waitresses.On December 20 in New York City, 30-year-old Kathy is eating with her best friend Danielle, who is describing a romantic Christmas movie she loves. Kathy is somewhat less enthusiastic about such movies, but Danielle absolutely loves them. Kathy is a food critic who reviews restaurants for a magazine and is up for a job at The New York Times. However, she is also a great cook and could do that. Danielle is an advice columnist.Kathy gets a call from her parents who want her to come home for Christmas. She is less than enthusiastic about the holiday because her parents didn't care that much about Christmas when they were in Washington, but when they moved to this small town and bought the Holly Hotel, things changed. For Kathy, it meant being taken away from the school and the friends she knew, and not having new friends. She wanted to get out of that place and New York City is her home now. Still, Kathy makes the trip.Back in Holly, Kathy doesn't pay attention to her speed, and her rental car is pulled over by ""super cute"" cop Mathew (that's how she describes him to Danielle). Kathy tries to talk her way out of a ticket but she was driving 51 in a 25 zone. Mathew shows signs of being generous, but he eventually gives her the ticket.Kathy arrives at the hotel and her parents are so happy to see her, and there is a big Christmas dinner planned. There is also a big secret that they won't say any more about. Kathy's parents insist that she conduct a tour of the hotel, something she hates doing, which she also did when she was younger. The notes she must follow haven't changed over the years.Sandra, the hotel's chef, visits Kathy before she conducts the tour. They are so happy to see each other. Like everyone else who knows Kathy's cooking, she says Kathy should give up her other career and be a chef.Despite her distaste for the job, Kathy is charming and perky as she takes guests on a tour of the hotel, describing its history, several special rooms, the rumors of ghosts, and other interesting information. She notices Mathew is one of those taking the tour, along with his crotchety 90-year-old grandmother. They stay for a meal, and Grandma Williams tries to set Kathy up with her grandson, and makes a number of comments that are allowed when a woman gets to be that age but might be inappropriate for most people.Sandra gets hurt and Kathy is asked to take over as head chef because William is not ready. Kathy is not willing to do the job, but eventually she agrees.Kathy and Danielle have several telephone conversations. Danielle is so excited and thinks Kathy is living one of the movies they enjoy. Kathy tells Danielle she should try writing movies.Mathew gets a day off and spends it with Kathy, going through the various quaint stores and getting coffee, with no audio other than instrumental music with no obvious significance for the holiday. They finally visit the police station and have a meeting with the chief, who says because Mathew was hiding when he caught Kathy speeding, he was not being welcoming to visitors, but treating the town as a speed trap. That was unacceptable, and the chief tears up Kathy's ticket.Mr. Hurst finally makes an appearance, but it is not obvious he is a ghost. His wife Nora, however, appears as if by magic. He doesn't like being startled but Nora doesn't know how to control what she does. They talk about how their efforts to get Kathy to return to the hotel are succeeding and even her relationship with Mathew might be their doing as well. The two ghosts appear several more times.Mathew and Kathy have another date, this time on a carriage pulled by a horse. The horse's driver appears to be Mr. Hurst, but he is apparently alive. After the carriage ride, Kathy doesn't really want to spend more time with Mathew, but then she does anyway.Kathy is beginning to care about this place when she gets a call from The New York Times. Not only does the paper want to hire her, but she is needed right away to review a new restaurant which is opening that day. To get there, she will have to leave soon and skip the dinner, where she would have been head chef. Kathy asks Danielle to pick her up at the airport.Kathy's parents are disappointed but willing to let her have her career. Mathew is not ready to let her go and his grandmother demands he do something. On her way to the airport, Kathy gets pulled over again, and she objects strongly to Mathew doing this outside his jurisdiction.Kathy's father is having a drink when he is joined by Mr. Hurst. They have a conversation where Kathy's father describes how things were with his children. His other daughter is living in Colorado but snowed in. He also has regrets about how he raised his daughters.Without Kathy, the dinner has to go on. William is in over his head and tries to get approval for a very ordinary menu, not the five-star cuisine that is expected. Sarah seems confident, however, and the staff goes to work. Sandra is still not back. However, before what promises to be a disaster, Kathy does make her return. As Danielle frustratingly waits at the airport, she gets a call from Kathy explaining what happened, which delights Danielle.A special guest arrives at the dinner. It is the President of the United States, or Uncle Tyler as Kathy knows him, along with the First Lady. He was a congressman when her father was. When Kathy finds out, she is still in the kitchen, but she doesn't dare make an appearance dressed like she is. Kathy changes into a fabulous red dress and meets with her old friend. Mathew is there too.A female soloist sings ""O Come All Ye Faithful"" for the diners.As the President reads ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"", Mathew and Kathy go to another room and finally admit their feelings for each other, and Mathew finally kneels and hands her a ring. This makes the Hurst ghosts very happy.","It follows Kathy, a food critic in New York City. Her parents ask her to come home for Christmas, and there she meets a handsome police officer, which now complicates her situation."

Jeremy's life is pretty good until a bully embarrasses him in front of the whole school and the love of his life breaks up with him. Devastated, he turns to Jules, his encourager. Jules is a tender heart with a tough exterior, but instead of comfort, Jules has some harsh truths for Jeremy about dealing with his fear. Later, when Jeremy stumbles across his arch-nemesis in crisis, he reluctantly rescues him. Jeremy begins to see how the pain of the past impacts how people respond in the present, and although he cannot change the past, having friends who support you and encourage you can give you the strength to overcome the fears and doubts and create a new dream for yourself.—Rovy13"

Shakey stepped foot onto the scene creating a home for players, and a spectacle for fans. When the final whistle blew in 1987 the Miami High Stingarees were holding the trophy, and Shakey was celebrating. Like all good things Shakey's tenure came to an end, but not before he made Miami High into a powerhouse program. Now with its most successful head coach leaving to test his skills at the college level, Miami High bet it all on other alumni and Shakey's pupil: Frank Martin.
In Martin's first year a few of his players were dismissive of him, and the student body doubted this new regime. Yet in true Miami High spirit, the young Martin found a way to bring his team together and as they say in the streets, ""prove the haters wrong"", to capture the first of three straight state titles. The following two years saw Frank Martin and Miami High welcome 3x NBA champion Udonis Haslem, a young kid from one of Miami's roughest neighborhoods who was as hungry to win as he was to learn about the game. They also embraced Steve Blake a prior county rival turned teammate and many other countless kids who just wanted to be part of a family.
But soon thereafter local newspaper Miami New Times put out an article pinpointing the school, its faculty, and its head basketball coach as illegal recruiters. The article reached the Florida High School Sports Association and led to an investigation that Frank Martin felt was one-sided as he was never interviewed by the governing body regarding the scandal.
To their surprise, the severity of the punishment handed impacted every single person who had been with Miami High's basketball program in the last decade and affected the immediate futures of some of today's biggest basketball stars. Their story has never been told, and it's a crazy one, which is why it could only happen in one place: ""The Asylum.""","After winning 8 championships at a state level and getting children out of poverty through sports, Miami Senior High School is investigated by state authorities for allegedly recruiting players. Includes revelatory interviews with NBA legend Udonis Haslem, NCAA Final Four coach Frank Martin and Miami's very own Shakey Rodriguez."

Dropping in on what would turn out to be a tumultuous final year of teaching, ""The Secret Song"" gives an intimate view into Goodkin's teaching approach, the vibrant impact it has on students and alumni, and the value of musical improvisation in navigating real-world challenges.A lifelong musician, Goodkin ""loved learning, but hated school."" He seeks to teach children differently than the traditional lessons he was raised with. After a chance exposure with an alternative approach to music education in college, Goodkin would devote his life to teaching music in an accessible and enjoyable way. Goodkin's time-tested methods are thrown into disarray as the COVID-19 pandemic forces the school into remote learning three months before Goodkin's planned retirement. A program which once prioritized group-learning, movement, dance, and instilling music ""through the ear, not through the eye"" has to adapt to an online format. Goodkin's close colleagues and friends, James Harding and Sofia Lopez-Ibor, who will take over the music program in his wake, share his heartbreak at the possibility he will not get a proper send off.Early in the film, viewers see children's eyes light up as simple rhymes and clapping patterns evolve into complex jazz pieces within a single class. Students find outlets for expression through unique ceremonies and rituals. Viewers experience the power of group sing-alongs to foster deep connections and joy.Students' confidence grows through exploration of musical ideas through movement, games, and improvisation, culminating in a captivating student-led performance that spans a vast musical spectrum. These successes seem to be put on hold amidst the COVID crisis, and yet viewers witness how Goodkin's commitment to music education continues to help the teachers and students find community, even in isolation. The audience is immersed in a world with music at its core, revealing the depth and reach of one person's gifts, and the importance of arts and music in our lives.",

Mila has the same object as a medallion and believes that the Wheel of Life could bring a new dawn in the unbalanced world of magic.
One day, when she is left alone, a young mage, called Varlahm, appears at her home. He turns out to know where the real Wheel of Life is. Mila soon learns that he is an enemy to her nation. Nevertheless, yearning to solve the mystery of the Wheel's power, she dares to run away with him from her uncle's home.
Varlahm stole the Wheel of Life from Gorday, the pompous and conceited leader of the Magi of Passion nation. Gorday desires to submit all other nations of magic to his narcissistic authority by any means and bask in the boundaryless power. Varlahm is doing what he can to find out exactly how Gorday is trying to subject them all and prevent his cunning plans. And he has a good reason.

The film interviews the uniquely charismatic musicians behind the music and looks at the dances, fashions and culture spawned by their genius.WE WERE HYPHY examines the genesis of Hyphy on Bay Area streets and traces its influence from legendary figures such as Keak da Sneak, Mac Dre, and Mistah FAB to modern day artists such as Kamaiyah, G-Eazy and Rafael Casal who were deeply influenced by the movement.WE WERE HYPHY is a top shelf love letter to Hyphy and its enduring place in the Hip Hop pantheon.

The love was born out of a grassroots movement and grew as Hyphy reached its nadir.

This tiny country is literally built on a hot bed of volcanoes. The 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption fascinated the rest of the world, with thousands of people making the pilgrimage to experience it during the six months it was active.This particular event was labeled a ""tourist"" eruption and had the single most effective impact in helping the Iceland economy get back on the road to recovery after the Covid-19 lock down. An unprecedented influx of people journeyed from everywhere the day restrictions were lifted and used the unusual opportunity to get up close and personal with a volcano.Volcanos generally have an unrivaled beauty and primal power, but the real story is about the people, in this case the Iceland population, who live in the shadow of what is likened to a ""volcanic culture."" They face special physical challenges that are different with each eruption, but there is also the connection and inspiration they feel as new land is created before their eyes in their own backyards. There is a fierce pride in their country and in their ability to survive and truly prosper in this oftentimes harsh and forbidding land.As we embarked on this filming adventure, we were able to access people from several different walks of life in Iceland, such as those who were a part of the Search and Rescue teams dealing with the daily broken bones and heart attacks that were always a possibility with tourists who underestimated their capabilities on the difficult trail to the volcano. We interviewed a helicopter pilot who flew back and forth to the site several times every day bringing indescribable feelings of awe to her passengers who were seeing an event like this for the first time in their lives. Then there are the artists who detailed their inspirations that are based in nature and being this close to new land as it is created.On many levels, this volcano brought back a sense of the magic of creation and the fact that nature always has the final say.","Volcanoes are a primal power in Iceland, but the real story is about the people who live in their shadows with the challenges, pride and inspiration they feel as new land is created before their eyes in their own backyards."
