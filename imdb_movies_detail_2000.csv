tt1160419,841928,10,1,8.0,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","['mother son relationship', 'mind control', 'empire', 'sandworm', 'combat']",https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3986080537/,"['Timothée Chalamet', 'Rebecca Ferguson', 'Zendaya']",['Denis Villeneuve'],"The story opens with a woman telling a portion of her people's history on the desert planet, Arrakis. The woman, Chani, is a Fremen. She explains that since before she was born the planet has been ruled by the cruel Harkonnens who have grown enormously rich harvesting the psychogenic substance ""melange"" also known as the spice. The Fremen have been trying to expel the Harkonnens, but to no avail. Recently, however, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has ordered the Harkonnens to leave Arrakis. Chani wonders who the new rulers will be.On the planet Caladan, Paul Atreides eats breakfast with his mother, Lady Jessica, Duke Leto's concubine. A member of the quasi-religious order of the Bene Gesserit, Jessica has been trying to teach her son the special powers of her order. She tests Paul by having him try to compel her to pass him a glass of water. Paul is only partially successful. Paul learns about the planet Arrakis and its people. It is the only source of the psychoactive spice, which extends life and perception. Spice is necessary for interstellar travel since it makes possible the expanded consciousness of the navigators who plot faster than light jumps, ""folding"" space time to travel instantly from one planet to another.Leto Atreides, along with soldier Gurney Halleck and mentat Thufir Hawat, receive an imperial envoy who formalizes the awarding of Arrakis to House Atreides. The emperor fears Leto's growing political power and popularity in the Landsraad, a conclave of noble houses. Leto recognizes that his appointment to oversee Arrakis is a trap of some kind, but cannot refuse an imperial offer. Paul asks his friend, the elite soldier Duncan Idaho to take him along when Duncan goes to Arrakis weeks ahead of time to scout things out. Duncan refuses. Paul confides that he's been having dreams about Arrakis and the Fremen, including one where Duncan falls in battle. Duncan dismisses this as merely a dream, telling Paul that ""Everything important happens when we're awake"".Paul discusses his wish to travel to Arrakis early with his father, but Leto refuses, saying that he needs Paul by his side. He explains the political situation: the emperor has set up a conflict between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, a war which will weaken them both, to the benefit of the Emperor. Leto instead intends to strike an alliance with the Fremen in order to harness their ""desert power"" to his own and outwit the Emperor. Paul expresses his doubts about his ability to succeed his father as a leader. Leto confides his own doubts when he was young and insists that Paul will find his way to leadership, just as he did.Gurney has a sparring session with Paul, insisting that the young ducal heir must be more wary about the danger posed by the Harkonnens and more ruthless in battle. Paul begins to have dreams of Chani. Jessica's Bene Gesserit superior, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam arrives on Caladan to test Paul. Before the meeting he is inspected by Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, who warns Paul that the Bene Gesserit have their own agenda. Mohiam puts Paul through the test of the Gom Jabbar, using a poisoned needle and a pain-inflicting box to judge his character. After the test, Mohiam asks Paul about his dreams and whether they sometimes come true. Afterward, Mohiam berates Jessica for producing a son for Duke Leto, rather than the daughters she had been ordered to produce.She accuses Jessica of thinking that her son might be the Kwisatz Haderach, the fulfillment of a Bene Gesserit messianic prophecy. Jessica confirms this belief and Mohiam warns her that Paul's abilities are not fully developed and that he might die in the coming trials. When Mohiam leaves, Paul confronts his mother about what Mohiam meant. Jessica explains that the Bene Gesserit have spent hundreds of years engaged in a selective breeding program to produce an unparalleled mind who can see both the past and the future.The Atreides arrive on Arrakis. When they disembark their ship, locals begin chanting a phrase Paul cannot recognize. Paul asks his mother and she explains that it's a local prophecy of the Lisan-al-Gaib, the ""voice from outer world"", a prophesied messiah on Arrakis. Jessica says that they think Paul might be this figure, but Paul dismisses it as mere superstition spread by the Bene Gesserit. Jessica hires a Fremen servant, Shadout Mapes. Mapes sees Jessica and Paul as a fulfillment of the Lisan-al-Gaib and gives Jessica a dagger made from the tooth of Shai-halud, the immense sandworms which make the desert of Arrakis so dangerous. That night, while he studies a holographic image of the muad'Dib desert mouse, Paul survives an assassination attempt by a hunter seeker drone when Mapes enters the room, distracting it.Leto surveys his new domain and discovers that the Harkonnens have sabotaged much of the needed infrastructure. They decide to take the issue to the imperial arbiter of the transition, an ecologist named Liet Kynes, who has resided on Arrakis for years. Duncan Idaho returns from several weeks living with the Fremen. He reports to the Duke that the Fremen are unparalleled fighters who live in communities known as ""sietchs"" in caverns beneath the desert. Duncan confirms Thufir Hawat's belief that there are many more Fremen than previously believed. The leader of one of these sietchs, Stilgar, has come to meet with Leto. Stilgar demands that the outworlders not travel beyond the city except to mine spice. Leto refuses but insists that the sietchs will remain inviolate and that Fremen will not be hunted while the Atreides rule. Paul invites Stilgar to stay, but he leaves. Duncan introduces the Atreides to some Fremen technology, including the moisture saving stillsuits and thumpers which are used to attract sandworms.Leto's party meets with Liet Kynes to investigate the spice mining operations. She inspects their stillsuits and finds that Paul has intuitively fitted his stillsuit in the Fremen manner. In the native language she says ""He shall know your ways as if born to them"". The party flies out to observe a spice mining operation. The mining vehicle -- a ""sandcrawler"" -- has attracted a worm, which is drawn by the rhythmic vibrations of the crawler as it collects the spice. When a flying carry-all fails to remove the mining vehicle, Duke Leto lands his small squad of ornithopters nearby to rescue the miners. When Paul gets out to guide the miners inside, he is hit with a massive dose of spice and has a series of visions including one of himself with Chani. He is nearly sucked down into the sand with the crawler when Gurney grabs him and hauls him aboard his father's ornithopter. The two watch as the worm's enormous, toothed maw opens and swallows the sandcrawler whole. Later, Paul is examined by Dr Yueh who informs Paul and his mother that the spice is psychoactive but shouldn't harm Paul.Duke Leto awakes at night with the sense that something is wrong. He calls security but gets no answer. He finds Mapes stabbed to death and is shot with a paralytic dart that burrows its way through his body shield and into his back, rendering him helpless. Yueh reveals himself as a traitor. He has lowered the shields and sabotaged Atreides communications. Yueh reveals to Leto that the Harkonnens secured his compliance because they have his wife held captive. He replaces one of Duke Leto's teeth with a poison capsule which he hopes the Duke can use to kill the Baron.Gurney is awakened and leads the counter attack as the Harkonnen forces, aided by the imperial Sardukar troops, begin their assault. The Atreides troops, caught unprepared and outnumbered by Harkonnen troops and the Sardukar, find themselves quickly overwhelmed. Duncan kills several Sardukar, takes an ornithopter and tries to rescue Paul and Jessica but finds them already gone.Baron Vladimir Harkonnen has promised Mohiam and the Bene Gesserit that he will not harm Paul or Jessica so he sends some of his men to take them to the desert to die of exposure. Paul, not fully secure in his Bene Gesserit abilities, is still able to use the Voice to order one of the men to remove his mother's gag. Jessica immediately orders one of the men to kill his comrade. When she's fully freed, she kills two of them personally. Their ornithopter is remotely disabled and lands. Paul and Jessica see the devastation of Arrakeen from a distance.Yueh meets with Baron Harkonnen and demands that the Baron honor his end of the deal. The Baron promises that Yueh will be reunited with his wife and then slits his throat. The Baron then gloats over a paralyzed Leto, who bites down on his fake tooth and expels the poison, killing everyone in the room except for the Baron who is gravely injured, having activated his body shield and used his anti-gravity suspensors to float to the ceiling. Medical technicians nurse the Baron back to health.Riding out a storm in a survival tent, Paul continues to have visions from his spice exposure. They are first of Chani. However, they quickly change to visions of bloody conflict and religious zealots, operating under the Atreides flag and in Duke Leto's name, spreading across the galaxy ""like and unquenchable fire"". Paul is horrified by what he sees and blames his mother and the Bene Gesserit but is eventually comforted by his mother.Paul and Jessica are rescued by Duncan Idaho, who managed to escape the slaughter. Duncan brings them to Kynes, who has set up in an abandoned terraforming station occupied by Fremen. The Sardukar track them there and attack, with the Fremen killing many of them. Duncan sacrifices himself in a last stand to allow Paul, Jessica, and Kynes to escape. Paul and Jessica flee in an ornithopter. Kynes sets up a thumper, intending to call a sandworm and ride it away, but she is mortally wounded by the Sardukar. Before they can deliver the killing blow, a sandworm arrives and Kynes attracts it to her by pounding a patch of drumsand. They are all swallowed by the worm.While piloting the ornithopter through a powerful sand storm, Paul has a vision of a Fremen man giving him advice, telling him that survival in the desert is a process and that he must move with the flow of the environment. Paul retracts the 'thopter's wings and allows them to be carried deeper into the desert by the vortex of the storm. They survive but with the ornithopter damaged they must set out on foot through the desert. As they do, they are observed by Fremen.Jessica and Paul make their way toward where they believe the Fremen sietch is. Their movements attract a sandworm and they make a run for some nearby rocks. The sandworm pauses, seemingly looking at Paul for few seconds before a thumper draws it away. A group of Fremen capture them. Stilgar is with them and recognizes Paul, saying that they can't touch him. Another Fremen, Jamis, dismisses Stilgar's belief and wants to kill Paul and Jessica and loot their bodies. Paul recognizes Jamis as the man from his visions.Jessica asks for help returning to Caladan, saying that they will be well rewarded, but Stilgar dismisses any reward they'd give as pointless. Stilgar offers to allow Paul, who is still young, to join their sietch, but says that Jessica, who he deems too old to learn to fight, must be left behind. Jessica and Paul use their Bene Gesserit training to disarm most of the Fremen and hold Stilgar at knife point. Stilgar, realizing that Jessica is a Bene Gesserit, relents and decides to take both of them to the sietch. Jamis objects, and challenges Jessica to a duel.Paul agrees to stand as his mother's champion. Chani, who is among the party, takes pity on Paul, who she believes will die at Jamis' hand, and gives him her crysknife, a dagger made from the tooth of the sandworm, a moment from one of Paul's visions. In the duel, Paul outclasses Jamis, repeatedly holding a knife to his throat and demanding that he yield. Stilgar informs him that Fremen duels are to the death, and Jessica says that Paul has never killed anyone before. Reluctantly, Paul kills Jamis. Satisfied, the Fremen take Paul and Jessica back to their sietch.Paul and Jessica see a Fremen impossibly riding a live worm. As they begin their journey into the desert, Chani tells Paul that ""this is only the beginning"".",A noble family becomes embroiled in a war for control over the galaxy's most valuable asset while its heir becomes troubled by visions of a dark future.

Then an old pickup truck comes hauling out of the mine shaft and down a desolate rural road. The driver is a bearded elderly man (Oliver Cooper) obscured in the darkness of his truck's cabin. He looks down at the passenger seat and touches a ghost trap that's holding a spirit. His truck is being chased by an unseen creature that is eventually able to sideswipe the vehicle and send it crashing into a cornfield. The man stumbles out into an open field in front of an old farm house. He gets to the porch and turns around and holds up the trap baiting the unseen spirit in the corn field. The old man is Egon Spengler and he readies a foot pedal switch as invisible steps are seen advancing in the dirt across the field. When it is in position, Egon stomps the pedal and several electric towers begin to activate. But they short out before powering on the device they were intended for and Egon quickly goes inside and shuts the door. He hides the trap in a compartment under the wood floor and then sits in a chair with his PKE meter. As fog fills the room, his PKE begins to light up and it's arms extend reminiscent of when a ghost is present. Egon is attacked in his chair and the PKE meter falls to the floor and turns off. A spirit orb is seen leaving the house from outside. Back in the house, the PKE meter activates again eluding to a new ghost nearby.We meet Callie (Carrie Coon) and her kids Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) as they are getting evicted from their apartment. Callie gets notice that her father has passed away in his farmhouse in Oklahoma and takes the kids with her to collect anything of value including the home. They find a dilapidated house full of clutter. As they're looking around, Janine (the Ghostbusters' receptionist) walks in and tells them that Callie's dad (Egon) had a lot of debt and a valueless farm. The ground begins to shake in what appears to be tremors from an earthquake, and the family huddle under a table. Phoebe spots the PKE meter under the chair her grandfather was in when he died.Callie takes Trevor and Phoebe into town to eat after she admits to them that they will be staying there for a while until she can figure out what to do. They find that it's a very small southern town where everyone knew of the mysterious man they all called ""the dirt farmer"" since there was no evidence he ever grew any crops. Trevor applies to work at the burger joint because he is smitten with the girl who works there named Lucky (Celeste O'Connor).In the following days Phoebe begins exploring the farm while using the PKE meter. She notices a chess board with an initial move made so she makes a move from her side of the board. Callie starts Phoebe in summer school and meets her teacher Gary (Paul Rudd) as she drops her off. Gary is just there to collect a paycheck and has the kids watch VHS's of old horror movies (the first one being Cujo (1983)) while he sits in the back doing research on the ongoing tremors in the area. Phoebe impresses him with her knowledge on Seismology and he explains to her that the tremor wave patterns don't match up with typical earthquakes from history. Phoebe also meets a boy in her class who calls himself ""Podcast"" (Logan Kim) since he's always recording for his show with his microphone.Back at the farmhouse, Phoebe sees that another move is made on the chess board and begins playing the ghost as the chess pieces begin moving in front of her. The ghost leads her downstairs by turning on lights until she finds the ghost trap under a floor panel. She takes it to Gary where he explains what it is based on his knowledge of the famed New York siege from 1984. He shows her and Podcast old footage of the Ghostbusters commercial on YouTube. They rig the trap to a school bus battery to get it to open. They succeed and a ghost resembling one of the demon dogs from the original flies away.Revelations come to fruition as Trevor finds Ecto-1 in the barn under a tarp and Phoebe finds Egon's lab in the basement. They both realize that their grandfather was a Ghostbuster and begin to take matters into their own hands. Phoebe repairs a proton blaster with help from Egon's invisible ghost and takes it out for a test with Podcast tagging along. Upon firing it, they hear a rustling in a nearby warehouse. They find the metal eating ghost named Muncher. They attempt to wrangle and capture him but fail. Meanwhile, Trevor repairs Ecto-1 and takes it for a joy ride where he comes upon Phoebe and Podcast who tell him what they were doing. The trio take off to capture Muncher in Ecto-1. They chase him thru the city and destroy tons of property with the proton gun. They succeed in capturing it with Egon's RC car mounted ghost trap. All the chaos alerted the police and they are subsequently pulled over and put in the town's holding cell. During their time at the jailhouse, Phoebe uses her ""one phone call"" option to call the number of the Ghostbusters from the commercial. Ray Stantz answers and explains that the team broke up after they had ostensibly eliminated all the ghosts. He and Egon had a falling out after Egon stole all their equipment claiming Gozer could still bring the end of the world. Phoebe tells him that Egon was killed a week ago before she is abruptly cut off by the sheriff claiming her phone time is up. Callie and Gary -who were out on a date during all of this- show up and bail them out.Phoebe confronts her mom for not telling her who their grandfather really was. Callie counters with the history she had with her dad. She wasn't into science like he was and felt like they never bonded and he didn't care about her. That's why he left them and became a recluse on the Oklahoma farm she concluded.The kids -feeling there's got to be a reason their grandfather would sacrifice everything to live on a farm in the middle of nowhere- find in his lab that his ""dirt farm"" was actually a field of hundreds of ghost traps meant to capture Gozer. They realize that his trap must have failed and set off to investigate the mine shaft once more. By this time Lucky has become close with Trevor thru work and the discovery that she is the sheriff's daughter. So she tags along to the mine with Trevor, Phoebe, and Podcast. They discover the root of all the tremors is the fact that the mine is actually a portal to the evil dead and every time Gozer attempts to raise the hoard of ghosts -along with the twin demon dogs- a series of 4 seismic activated proton guns that Egon rigged up inside turn on. They automatically cross beams and suppress the constant attempts of the ghosts trying to escape. This was the source of the recurrent tremors everyone in town was experiencing and holding Gozer back was the insurmountable task Egon had taken on alone since no one else believes him.That same night, Gary goes to Walmart to pick up some ice cream after his unusual date with Callie. He discovers several mini StayPuft marshmallow men roaming the store causing chaos like a bunch of gremlins. He comes upon the demon dog he released earlier and gets chased out to his car and attacked just like the scene from Cujo. Back at the farmhouse, Callie finds the hidden lab and discovers that her father Egon had a memory board of all her life on the wall. Just as she realizes that he truly cared about her, the other demon dog finds her in the lab and possesses her.The kids come home to reveal their discovery to Callie but find her possessed, before she jumps out the window and runs off towards the mine shaft. She finds Gary, who has already allowed the ghosts to start escaping by damaging the auto-proton guns that were keeping them at bay. The two ""merge energies"" in the mine. The kids retrieve Ecto-1 from the police impound with Lucky's help. Phoebe and Podcast are able to get the RC ghost trap and proton blaster out from the weapon holding cell by reaching in and releasing Muncher who immediately eats away the bars and escapes.They arrive at the mine and witness Callie and Gary transforming into the demon dog forms with Gozer sitting between them. Phoebe steps out from hiding to talk to and distract Gozer while Podcast controls the RC trap and captures the demon dog possessing Callie. This releases her from dog form as she passes out. The kids escape in Ecto-1 with Callie as the Gary -still possessed in dog form- chases after them.They make their way to the farmhouse and attempt the same trap as Egon. Callie and Phoebe stand on the porch holding the ghost trap with the demon dog that Gozer needs to become fully resurrected. Gozer appears out of the corn field and Phoebe tries to turn on the traps but they fail again just as they had the first time with Egon. Some mini StayPuft marshmallow men sabotage the equipment inside Ecto-1, which allows Gozer to release the demon dog from the ghost trap. The freed dog possesses Lucky. Just as Gozer, now back to full strength, is about to kill Phoebe, she is hit with a proton blast from behind. It's Ray Stantz who had just arrived with Peter Venkman and Winston Zeddemore! The three original Ghostbusters cross the beams and fire at Gozer. She appears subdued but then begins uncrossing the beams and blasts the Ghostbusters back causing them all to fall down. Gozer approaches them as Peter jokingly complains about the inherent troubles in their relationship. Just as she reaches them she is again captured by a sole proton beam. This time it's Phoebe, whose aim is being guided by the ghost of Egon. This is the first time his image is revealed to the audience.The other three Ghostbusters jump up and join the battle by firing their beams as well. With the combined force of four beams once again, Gozer is suppressed but not captured. Meanwhile, Trevor and Podcast have been able to defeat the mini-Pufts and repair the sabotaged equipment, allowing Trevor to emerge from Ecto-1 and fire his proton beam at the electrical capacitors. The burst of energy charges them up. Callie throws the switch to try to turn the traps on again, and this time they successfully activate, capturing Gozer and the demon dogs.The other three original Ghostbusters stare in amazement at the sight of the ghost form of their fallen comrade. They watch as he says goodbye, fixes Phoebe's glasses -identical to his- and gives Callie a hug. Having reconciled with his family, Egon's form fades and dissipates into the night sky. Lucky and Gary break free of the frozen dog carcasses, and the three surviving original Ghostbusters become acquainted with the Spenglers, before Winston tells them that he will fix up Ecto-1, and the three original Ghostbusters take it and their equipment back to New York City. We see an overhead shot of Ecto-1 driving with emergency lights on across a bridge in New York City as the theme song ""Ghostbusters"" begins.There is a mid-credits scene where Dana Barrett Venkman (Sigourney Weaver) tests Peter Venkman's psychic powers with the same patterned cards and electro-shock machine Peter had used in his University research before he became a Ghostbuster, and a post-credits scene shows a brief conversation between Winston, who is now the wealthy head of his family, and Janine, in which Winston mentions that he has been using his resources to maintain the Ghostbusters' properties, including Ray's Occult Bookstore and the fire station that had originally served as the Ghostbusters' headquarters. This is followed by Winston opening the fire station's door to allow Ecto-1 to be driven back inside, after which we see a shot of the basement's containment system with a blinking red light.","When a single mom and her two kids arrive in a small town, they begin to discover their connection to the original Ghostbusters and the secret legacy their grandfather left behind."

Kong is visited by Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the last Iwi native (Deaf) and adopted daughter of Kong expert Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) (A Monarch anthropological linguist), who is deaf and communicates with Kong via sign language. Kong is getting too big for the electronic dome under which he has been kept and Ilene knows that he won't last in there much longer. But if Kong leaves Skull Island, Godzilla will come for him, as there can't be 2 alphas.Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry), an employee of Apex Cybernetics and host of a Titan conspiracy theory podcast, extracts data suggesting sinister activities at a Pensacola facility (shipping manifests to Apex's facility in Hong Kong and designs of a massive machine). However, Godzilla suddenly attacks the facility, during the rampage, Bernie stumbles on a massive device.Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown), a fan of Bernie's podcast (The daughter of Monarch scientists Mark and the late Emma Russell. Madison believes there is a reason for Godzilla's erratic behavior, suspecting a conspiracy formulated by the Apex Cybernetics (She believes something at Apex provoked Godzilla)), enlists her friend Josh (Julian Dennison) to investigate Godzilla's attacks.Apex CEO Walter Simmons (Demián Bichir) (Maia's father, CEO, and founder of Apex Cybernetics, a tech organization invested in trying to solve the Earth's ""Titan problem,"" secretly creating Mechagodzilla to exterminate them) recruits Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgård) (A Monarch geologist and chief cartographer who works closely with Kong and charts the mission into the Hollow Earth), former Monarch scientist, and Hollow Earth theorist, to guide a search for a power source into the Hollow Earth, the home world of the Titans. Walter convinces Nathan that the new power source is required to keep the titans in check.Nathan is initially hesitant as his brother died in an expedition to the Hollow Earth due to a strong reverse-gravitational effect. He agrees after Walter reveals that Apex has developed HEAVs (Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicle), specialized crafts able to withstand the pressure exerted by the gravity field.Nathan meets with Ilene and convinces her to let Kong guide them through the Hollow Earth via an outpost in Antarctica. The entries to hollow earth can only be opened by a titan.
Nathan, Ilene, and an Apex team led by Walter's daughter Maia (Eiza González) board a modified barge escorted by the U.S. Navy that carries a sedated and restrained Kong. Kong is kept under control by Jia. Irene is astounded to learn that Kong understands sign language.Godzilla attacks the convoy and defeats Kong (Nathan releases Kong's shackles after Godzilla tilts the barge on which Kong and the entire Apex team was hosted. Kong manages to push back Godzilla enough to set the barge upright and save Jia) (Kong shifts the battle to the aircraft carrier to protect Jia. Godzilla uses his atomic breath to destroy the carrier. Kong can't breathe underwater and is defeated easily) but retreats after the ships disable their power and trick him into thinking they are destroyed. To avoid alerting Godzilla, Kong is airlifted to the Hollow Earth entrance, and Jia convinces him to enter the tunnel (as there is no way for Kong to survive in the cold Antarctic climate and fleet was destroyed getting there) while the team follows him in the HEAVs.Madison and Josh find Bernie (Madison tracks the sales of bleach as Bernie uses bleach to avoid all organic tracking technology), who joins their investigation. They sneak into the wrecked Apex base, discover a secret facility underground, and are inadvertently locked into an underground monorail transport to Apex headquarters in Hong Kong, where they unwittingly stumble on a test of Mechagodzilla. It is telepathically controlled by Ren Serizawa (Shun Oguri) (Apex's chief technology officer), the son of the late Ishiro Serizawa, through the neural networks from the skull of a severed Ghidorah head but is hobbled by its power supply's limitations. Ren is using home grown skull crawlers to train himself in using the Mechagodzilla (it has a laser breath). Walter intends to harness the Hollow Earth's energy to overcome Mechagodzilla's limitations.Inside the Hollow Earth, Kong and the team find an ecosystem similar to Skull Island (with flying skull crawlers, who destroy one of the HEAVs before Kong fights them off). They discover his species' ancestral throne room, where they find remains of an ancient war with Godzilla's kind and a glowing ax made from another Godzilla's dorsal plates. As they identify the power source, the Apex team sends its signature back to their Hong Kong base despite Ilene's protests.
Attracted by Mechagodzilla's activation, Godzilla arrives in Hong Kong, and sensing Kong, he directly drills a shaft to the throne room with his atomic breath. Maia and the Apex team attempt to escape in the ensuing mayhem, but their HEAV is crushed by Kong. Kong, Ilene, Jia, and Nathan ascend to Hong Kong, where Kong engages Godzilla in a final battle. Kong initially gains the upper-hand; however, Godzilla emerges victorious after incapacitating Kong (Shoulder dislocation and cracked ribs).Madison, Josh, and Bernie are caught by security and taken to Walter. Despite Ren's concerns over the power source's volatility, Walter orders him to activate Mechagodzilla. Now possessed by Ghidorah's consciousness, Mechagodzilla kills Walter, electrocutes Ren, and then attacks Hong Kong. Godzilla and Mechagodzilla battle, but Godzilla is overwhelmed. The laser beam is more than a match for atomic breath and soon enough Godzilla is being thrown around like a toy.Nathan revives Kong by destroying the HEAV (Kong's heartbeat was weak, and Nathan uses the HEAVs engines to produce an electromagnetic pulse, large enough to give a kick start to Kong's heart), and Jia convinces him to help Godzilla. As Mechagodzilla overpowers both Titans, Josh short-circuits Mechagodzilla's controls with Bernie's flask of liquor, momentarily interrupting the Mecha. Godzilla charges Kong's ax with his atomic breath, allowing Kong to destroy Mechagodzilla. Madison, Bernie, and Josh reunite with Mark Russell, while Godzilla and Kong acknowledge each other before the two go their separate ways.Sometime later, Monarch has established an observation post in the Hollow Earth, where Kong now rules.",The epic next chapter in the cinematic Monsterverse pits two of the greatest icons in motion picture history against each other--the fearsome Godzilla and the mighty Kong--with humanity caught in the balance.

They soon realize that their windows look directly into the apartment across the street, where a man with a professional studio is taking photographs of a woman. Pippa and Thomas watch as the couple have sex. Thomas continues to watch at first, but stops at Pippa's insistence. They jokingly give their neighbors pseudo names, Margot and Brent.Pippa, who works as a trainee optometrist at L'Optique, receives a bird feeder from her boss as a housewarming gift. Pippa buys a pair of binoculars so she and Thomas can watch the couple. They often see ""Brent"" having sex with several models while ""Margot"" is out.Pippa expresses interest in knowing what the neighbors are saying, eventually learning that Thomas knows a way to listen in on another room using a laser pointer; the process requires a reflective surface to send the laser beam back to them. When ""Brent"" and ""Margot"" throw a Halloween costume party in their apartment, Pippa and Thomas sneak in by posing as guests. Pippa plants a mirror in the apartment, later allowing her and Thomas to listen in on their conversations. They are unsettled to hear ""Margot"" confront ""Brent"" about his adultery; ""Brent"" assaults ""Margot"" and convinces her that her suspicions are unfounded.The next day, ""Margot"", whose real name is Julia, visits L'Optique where she receives an eye exam from Pippa and orders a new set of stylish glasses recommended by her. Julia invites Pippa to hang out. Pippa wants to warn Julia about ""Brent's"" adultery, but Thomas insists that she stop spying on the neighbors. Later, Pippa and Julia meet at a spa; Julia reveals that her husband is named Sebastian, or Seb, and is a well-known photographer.Pippa observes Seb having a threesome and throwing a condom away afterwards. She later discovers how to access Julia and Seb's wireless printer, which she uses to anonymously expose Seb's infidelities to Julia, mentioning the condom as proof. Thomas angrily confronts Pippa about being so invested in Julia and Seb's lives. The next morning, Pippa apologizes to Thomas and promises to stop watching the neighbors. However, they then see Seb discover Julia's body in the bathroom, after she seemingly slit her own throat. Thomas blames Pippa for Julia's death, breaks up with her, and leaves.Although heartbroken, Pippa continues to watch Seb and one evening decides to follow him to a nearby pub. Seb sits by Pippa and they talk. He asks her to let him photograph her at his apartment, which she accepts. Seb convinces Pippa to pose nude for him, and they eventually have sex. Upon returning home, Thomas consumes a drink Pippa left in the refrigerator and pours it into her bird feeder. He notices Pippa having sex with Seb across the street. The next morning, a horrified Pippa finds Thomas dead in their apartment, having apparently hanged himself.Pippa and her friend Ari go to Seb's exhibition, which turns out to be a collaboration with Julia, who is alive. Pippa and Thomas are revealed to be the subjects of the exhibition. Seb and Julia divulge that they own the apartment rented by Pippa and Thomas (whose lease included a clause stating that they consented to be photographed), and they knew they were being watched. Distressed, Pippa storms off. She decides to move out of the apartment, and notices dead birds on a grate just below her bird feeder.Following an interview promoting their exhibition, Seb and Julia return home to find a congratulatory bottle of wine by their door. As they drink the wine, Pippa sends a message to their printer saying she knows they killed Thomas. After leading Seb and Julia into L'Optique, Pippa deduces that while she was having sex with Seb, Julia poisoned Thomas's drink and staged his suicide. Pippa also reveals that she spiked their wine, causing Julia and Seb to faint. Pippa places the two under a LASIK machine, using it to burn their corneas.A new couple have moved into Pippa and Thomas's former apartment. They observe Seb and Julia in their apartment, both of whom are now blind. Pippa watches Seb and Julia from the rooftop, before leaving her binoculars behind.

Quentin is hailed as an inter-dimensional warrior who sacrificed himself to protect the planet.
Happy and May broke up. J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons) leads the public trial against Spider-Man and builds a negative image of him. Peter explains to DODC that Nick Fury is his witness, but he is told that Nick Fury has been off-planet for the entire year.Lawyer Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) gets Parker's charges dropped, but the group grapples with negative publicity. Since Peter's home is under 24*7 media coverage, May and Peter shift to Happy's apartment. The world is equally divided between fans and protesters of Spider-Man.
Eugene (Tony Revolori) tries to cash in on the mania by claiming to be Peter's best friend and even publishes a book.
After Parker, MJ, and Ned's MIT applications are rejected (the trio were also rejected at all of their backup schools. It is very clear that MJ and Ned were rejected due to their association to Peter), Parker goes to the New York Sanctum to ask Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) (A neurosurgeon who became a Master of the Mystic Arts following a career-ending car accident) for help.
Strange suggests a spell that would make people forget Parker is Spider-Man (Wong (Benedict Wong) warns Strange that the spell is dangerous since it travels the border between known and unknown reality), but the spell is corrupted when Parker repeatedly requests alterations to let his loved ones (MJ, Ned and Aunt May) retain their memories. Strange contains the spell to stop it from working and makes Parker leave.Parker tries to convince an MIT administrator (Paula Newsome) to reconsider MJ and Ned's applications but is attacked by Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) (A scientist from an alternate reality with four artificially intelligent mechanical tentacles fused to his body after an accident). Octavius rips Parker's nanotechnology from his Iron Spider suit which bonds with his mechanical tentacles and allows Parker to disable them.
The MIT administrator sees the whole battle firsthand and realizes that Peter is a hero, when he overcomes all odds to save her life against Otto. She leaves promising to look into admissions for Peter and his friends.As Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) (A scientist and the CEO of Oscorp from an alternate reality who tested an unstable strength enhancer on himself. He developed an insane split personality as a result and uses advanced Oscorp armor and equipment) arrives and attacks, Strange Teleports Parker back to the Sanctum and locks Octavius in a cell next to Curt Connors / Lizard (Rhys Ifans) (an Oscorp scientist from Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) who transformed into a large reptilian monster while trying to regrow his missing arm).Strange explains that before he was able to contain the corrupted spell it summoned some people from other universes who know Spider-Man's identity. He orders Parker, MJ, and Ned to find and capture them. Strange gives Peter a bracelet that generates a spell and transports the person whom it is aimed at, straight to a cell in the Sanctum's basement.
They are able to locate and retrieve Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) (An Oscorp electrical engineer from an alternate reality who gained electric powers after an accident involving genetically modified electric eels) and Flint Marko / Sandman (Thomas Haden) (a small-time robber from Raimi's Spider-Man 3 who received sand-like abilities following an accident).Osborn reclaims control of himself from his split Green Goblin personality. He goes to a F.E.A.S.T. (Food, Emergency, Aid, Shelter and Training) building where May comforts him before Parker retrieves him. While discussing their battles with Spider-Man, Osborn, Octavius, and Dillon realize that they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths. Strange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Parker argues that they should first cure the villains' powers and insanity to prevent their deaths upon their return.Parker steals the spell, traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and, with May, takes the villains to Happy Hogan's (Jon Favreau) (The head of security for Stark Industries and former driver and bodyguard of Tony Stark, who looks after Parker) apartment. He cures Octavius, but Osborn's Goblin persona takes control and convinces the uncured villains to betray Parker. As Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape, Goblin fatally injures May. Before she dies, May tells Parker that ""with great power, there must also come great responsibility"".Ned discovers that he can create portals using Strange's sling ring, which he and MJ use to try to locate Parker. They instead find alternate versions of Parker from the villains' universes who were also summoned by Strange's spell and who are nicknamed ""Peter-Two"" (Tobey Maguire) (An alternate version of Parker who utilizes organic webbing instead of web shooters like his alternate counterparts) and ""Peter-Three"" (Andrew Garfield) (An alternate version of Parker who is haunted by his failure to save his deceased girlfriend, Gwen Stacy). The group finds this universe's Parker, nicknamed ""Peter-One"", who is ready to give up and send the villains home. The alternate Parkers share stories of losing loved ones and encourage Peter-One to fight in May's honor, and the three Parkers develop cures for the villains.The group lure Dillon, Marko, and Connors to the Statue of Liberty. Peter-One and Peter-Two cure Marko and Connors while Octavius arrives to help cure Dillon, and Ned frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension with a portal. Goblin appears and unleashes the contained spell which begins pulling more people in from other universes. Strange attempts to hold them off while an enraged Peter-One tries to kill Goblin.
Peter-Two stops him, and Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject Goblin with his cure, restoring Osborn's sanity. Peter-One realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone's memory and requests that Strange do so, while promising MJ and Ned that he will find them again. The spell is cast, and everyone returns to their respective universes-including Eddie Brock / Venom (Tom Hardy), who leaves behind a piece of the Venom Symbiote.Two weeks later, Parker visits MJ and Ned to reintroduce himself, but decides against it. While mourning at May's grave, he has a conversation with Hogan and is inspired to carry on, making a new suit and resuming his vigilantism.","With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange for help.

He even uses his skills to bounce the ball off the walls and kill a canary. He is then pulled away by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) as she assigns him to a task.Savant is thrown into Task Force X/The ""Suicide Squad"" (also known as Team 2) alongside Blackguard (Pete Davidson), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Weasel (Sean Gunn), Mongal (Mayling Ng), Javelin (Flula Borg), The Detachable Kid/TDK (Nathan Filion), and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). Led by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the team travels to the island of Corto Maltese for their mission. Upon arriving, Weasel falls into the water and apparently drowns since nobody knew he couldn't swim. When the Squad makes it to land, Blackguard steps out and reveals he brought the team to the mercenaries waiting for them on the beach. For his troubles, he gets his face blown off. Harley goes in blasting while Boomerang throws his signature weapon to slice some heads off. TDK's arms pop off so he can use them as (ineffective) weapons. The mercenaries retaliate and shoot TDK and Javelin dead. Mongal attempts to bring a chopper down but it crashes and she burns to death. Boomerang is impaled with wood and then shredded by the chopper's blades. Harley and Flag go missing while Savant attempts to flee the chaos. Although Waller warns him, she detonates the explosive in the back of his head, causing it to blow up. She then sends in her second team to finish the job.Three days earlier.......Amanda Waller goes to recruit Robert DuBois/Bloodsport (Idris Elba), a deadly mercenary who is there for putting Superman in the ICU with a kryptonite bullet. Her leverage against him is Bloodsport's teenage daughter Tyla (Storm Reid), who is in danger of serving time for stealing. The two argue loudly, as Tyla makes it clear that Bloodsport was a bad father. He goes to threaten Waller into releasing Tyla, but she knows he is going to comply regardless. After he relents, she introduces him to her other recruits - Christopher Smith/Peacemaker (John Cena), a patriotic mercenary; Cleo Cazo/Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), who has the ability to control rats and keeps one named Sebastian close by; Nanaue/King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), an underwater prince with a taste for human meat; and Abner Krill/Polka Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), a man with an unusual genetic disorder whose specialty is throwing weaponized polka dots.Waller informs the team about the situation in Corto Maltese - the nation was overthrown by a dictator named Silvio Luna (Juan Diego Botto) and his right-hand man General Mateo Suarez (Joaquin Cosio) after they executed the presidential family. They are operating in a Nazi-era research facility called Jotunheim where they are conducting dangerous experiments, code-named ""Project Starfish"". The Squad is assigned to find Dr. Gaius Grieves/The Thinker (Peter Capaldi) since he can lead them to Jotunheim and they can destroy whatever is going on in there. We jump to the facility where Luna and Suarez are observing their work, a gigantic starfish alien creature.Presently, while Team 2 is making their way through the jungle, they come across a group that they believe to be mercenaries in league with the military, so the Squad kills them before they make it to the camp where Flag is hanging out with his contact Sol Soria (Alice Braga), a dissident whose team, the Freedom Fighters, is trying to take Corto Maltese back from Luna and Suarez...and unfortunately her team was the group that the Squad just killed. The team walks out of the jungle when they notice Polka Dot Man glowing different colors. He explains that his condition happened because his mother worked at STAR Labs and experimented on him and his siblings to give them superpowers. His condition forces him to drain the dots out of him or he will die, and he views all of his enemies as his mother before killing them. Before heading to Jotunheim, Flag insists that they recover Harley.Harley has been taken captive by Luna's men, but he brings her to his room to woo her since she is seen in the country as a symbol of anti-American anarchy. Harley is initially charmed by him, and he even asks her to marry him. However, when he reveals his plan of using whatever is in Jotunheim to eliminate anyone who threatens his regime, even if it means killing children. This crosses Harley and she shoots Luna dead, leading to his men to capture and imprison her.The Squad is being taken by Sol's contact Milton (Julio Cesar Ruiz) to go to a bar called La Gatita Amable where they will find Thinker. On the road there, Ratcatcher asks Bloodsport why he is afraid of rats, as he is always recoiling around Sebastian even though, according to Cleo, he sees good in Bloodsport. DuBois states that his father once punished him with rats, and it lead to his phobia. When he asks her why she is so drawn to rats, she explains that her father, Ratcatcher 1 (Taika Waititi), taught her how to control them but also treat them as family, but he was a drug addict and ultimately overdosed when she was a child. Bloodsport and Ratcatcher promise to one another that they will get each other out alive. The team makes it to the bar, but Nanaue has to stay behind since he will stick out.The Squad drinks and dances before they spot Thinker. They apprehend him, but the military comes in to search everyone since they know that there are Americans in there. Bloodsport sends Ratcatcher outside with Thinker while he, Peacemaker, and Polka Dot Man are all taken in. On the road, the three subdue the gunmen and kill the driver before their van is run off the road. Ratcatcher and King Shark arrive with Thinker in tow.Meanwhile, Harley is being tortured by Suarez's men for information, but she never budges. When she is left alone with his guard, she snaps his neck with her legs and sets herself free. Harley proceeds to shoot down Suarez's guards before getting her hands on some blades and Javelin's... javelin to slaughter her way through the guards. Outside, Flag tries to lead the Squad to rescue Harley until she shows up and joins them. They then get Thinker and order him to get them inside Jotunheim.Once inside (and after Milton is killed), Thinker leads the Squad to the creature that he calls Starro The Conqueror. Peacemaker and Nanaue set up bombs all over the place. Thinker reveals to the Squad that the American government was behind the experiments involving Starro since they have been secretly funding Corto Maltese for decades. Starro also emits smaller starfish that attach themselves to human faces and take over their bodies like zombies, and there are slews of corpses of Starro's other victims all over the facility. Starro breaks free and grabs Thinker, tearing him in two and splattering him across the wall. Flag attempts to secure the hard drive with evidence against the American government to deliver to the press, but Peacemaker turns on him per Waller's orders. The two fight each other, with Flag nearly choking Peacemaker to death, but he stabs Flag through the heart with a piece of a broken sink. Ratcatcher witnesses this and grabs the flash drive while Peacemaker attempts to kill her. Meanwhile, Nanaue comes across small fish that mimic him, until their aquarium is broken and they begin to leech onto him, all while Bloodsport, Harley, and Polka Dot Man try to survive the crumbling facility. Bloodsport manages to survive going through several stories before he lands and witnesses Peacemaker getting ready to execute Ratcatcher. The two mercs draw their guns and fire their bullets at each other, with Bloodsport's bullet breaking through Peacemaker's and striking him in the throat, bringing him down.King Shark falls outside and is shot by Suarez's men, but he rises and bites the head off one gunmen before the rest of the Squad runs out of the facility as Starro bursts out. It releases more starfish that kill Suarez and his men and then proceeds to make its way into the city. Waller declares the mission over since the evidence is destroyed, but the surviving members want to save the city. Waller threatens to detonate their devices and kill them on the spot until her subordinate, Flo Crawley (Tinashe Kajese) brains her with a golf club and has the rest of the team guide the Squad to save the city. At the same time, Sol and her team execute the remaining members of the regime to stage their coup and take their country back.Bloodsport begins blasting away at Starro while King Shark goes ""nom nom"" on the alien and starts to bite into it. Polka Dot Man envisions Starro as his mother and unleashes his polka dots to burn Starro's leg, but the alien crushes him. Ratcatcher tries to use her beacon to summon the rats, but Bloodsport pushes her out of the way before she is killed. She then uses the beacon and gets practically every rat in the city to take down the infected citizens and start to take Starro down. Harley then charges into Starro's eye with the javelin and breaks through before the rats make their way inside and take Starro down from the inside, finally killing it and saving the city. The Squad's heroics are broadcast on the news, and Tyla acknowledges her father as a hero.Bloodsport contacts Waller, ordering her to let the team and Tyla go free, or they will leak the evidence from the laboratory to the press. She reluctantly agrees and calls for the chopper to bring them home. As the team rests, Sebastian crawls onto Bloodsport's leg, and he begins to pet the rat.Mid-Credits Scene: Weasel is shown to still be alive and starts wandering into the jungle of Corto Maltese.Post-Credits Scene: Waller's subordinates John Economos (Steve Agee) and Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland) are brought to a room where they find that Peacemaker is still alive, because Waller needs him, as Harcourt puts it, ""to save the fucking world.""","Supervillains Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker, and a collection of nutty cons at Belle Reve prison join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X as they are dropped off at the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese."

After getting down at the hospital and while carrying the girl inside, the man warns the woman saying ""Not a word"".Next, we see a family eating at a table. Don and his wife Renee are raising two daughters Amy and Sara. Sara is rebellious and sneaks out to dance at a bonfire with her motorcycle-riding boyfriend. His name is Chris, and he also plays the guitar. He sings Sara a song and tells her that he loves her.When Sara comes home the next morning, Don is pissed and screams at his daughter. He says as long as she lives in his house, she will follow his rules. Sara makes plans with Amy and Renee to move out on her own when she becomes 18. Don overhears the conversation and preps his bomb shelter in the basement. He plans to lock his daughter inside so she can't leave him.While Renee is out shopping, Don asks Sara to help him move stuff in the basement. Then he locks her in and soundproofs the room. She is literally trapped in a bomb shelter and has no way out. The bin is full of clothing. We get a day counter. This is Day 1 of many, many, more to come.Sara is living like a caged animal. The keypad has three tries before shutting down the air circulation. Sara uses pots to piss in and takes every opportunity to scream for help and fight to be freed. Don tells her that she will earn her privileges and is being punished for her behavior. Then he rapes his own daughter.Renee thinks her daughter has run away and calls the police. Don and Renee talk with the police, who think Sara is a runaway, and there isn't much they can do because she is eighteen.Day 7- Sara is bruised and battered. She thinks of Chris to get herself through the trauma she is experiencing. Ironically, Chris shows up to question Don about where Sara is. Don lies and says she ran off with another man named Stevie.Day 21 - Don goes downstairs, forces Sara to put on a red dress, gives her a birthday cake, and asks her what she wants. She says she want to be released, to which he says that it is too early. Then she asks for a TV, to which he says she has to earn it. Then she asks for a clock. He agrees and ask her to come closer. (Probably she gets raped again)Day 38 - The next time he comes down, she is ready and attacks him with a makeshift weapon. (A corned beef can lid attached to some wood.) But he easily avoids the attack and beats her and probably rapes her again.Fast Forward from Day 39 to Day 354- Sara is pregnant with her father's child/her sister. She delivers her baby with no medical assistance or proper medical hygiene. She is using a nursing book to prepare for the baby. She names the baby Marie.Four years later, Sara is raising her daughter and she is also pregnant again. They are all locked in the basement together and only have one another. Sara seems calmed down and talks with Don, even offering him tea once he visits. Don has got a promotion and tells that he is going to have a new office. He also has provided her with some basic necessities, such as a table, cupboards, a mattress etc. Sara asks him whether he could release them to which he responds angrily. But he later provides them with a TV as a Christmas present.Year 7 - Sara has given birth to a son (named Michael) and all are living in the basement. The daughter Marie seems to be sick and Don provide some pills, but Sara says they are not for kids and does not know what the dosage would be. She demands Marie needs a doctor, but Don just leaves.Chris still is looking for Sara and shares with Amy the lies he heard from Don about Sara eloping with Stevie. Amy admits that her father has been abusive with her mother and thinks that Don did something to her sister. Then she confronts Don and accuses him of doing something. Renee wants to go to a private investigator, which sets Don off. They argue, and Don drops his basement keys. Amy picks them up and snoops around the basement, only to be caught by an aggressive Don.Sara has her third baby (a boy named Thomas) and convinces Don to leave the baby on the doorstep with a note from her asking to take care of her newborn baby. Don leaves the baby for Renee to find. He finds a smaller note Sara left asking her mom to call the police because she is trapped in the basement.14 years. The children, Marie and Michael, are growing up. They have social anxiety from being locked in a basement bunker their whole lives. They do not understand how horrible the situation they are in really is.17 Years. In the basement lock up they notice a leak in the ceiling and start digging their way out with a spoon. Meanwhile Renee has some bonding time with grandson Thomas. Sara spends all night digging; she is also pregnant again. The hole leads to the front yard, and she flashes a light signaling a neighbor for help. When the neighbor goes to the front door and tells Don, he goes downstairs and beats his pregnant daughter, causing her to miscarry.18 Years in captivity, Don fills Sara in about her other son living just above them named Thomas. He uses Thomas to turn Marie and Michael against their mother. They demand to be let out, and Sara can't take it. She freaks out and collapses on the floor, crying. She thinks of her boyfriend Christopher and the love he showed her. Sara tells her children the truth about Don. The kids understandably are overwhelmed. Marie is asthmatic and has trouble breathing due to limited air supply in the basement.19 Years - Don comes down to the basement and has an argument with Sara about rationing food. Michael gets angry and tries to beat up Don. That only makes him angrier.Above ground, Don isn't doing so great either. He constantly fights with his wife, is fired from his job, and his house is in foreclosure. He is tired of taking care of Sarah and the kids and funnels carbon monoxide into the basement (by keeping the car started) air vents with a hose while they sleep. Thomas catches Don in the garage and wonders what his grandfather is doing. Don has a change of heart and doesn't kill them. He goes to the basement to check on them and we see that they are okay and still sleeping.20 Years - Marie has breathing problems and has an asthma attack so bad that she needs medical attention. Sara begs Don to take them to the hospital, and she even calls him ""Dad."" He rushes them to the ER. It is the same scene we saw at the start of the film. Doctors fight to save Marie. Elisabeth Röhm plays a concerned doctor and asks about Marie's medical history. Sara asks to go to the bathroom, and Don refuses to let her go. She spills water on Don's paperwork and makes her way to get help while he gets a new form. Sara tells the doctor everything.

Its source code was stolen from an unreleased game called Life Itself, developed by Walter ""Keys"" McKey and Millie Rusk, and used by Soonami's head developer Antwan Hovachelik to create Free City. Keys has since taken a job at Soonami, while Millie spends time within Free City as her avatar Molotov Girl to find evidence of code that she and Keys had written and to prove that they are the rightful owners of the code.In the game, Guy, a non-player character (NPC), works as a bank teller and spends time with his best friend and co-worker, bank security guard Buddy, unaware that his world is a video game. One day, he encounters Molotov Girl, who is singing the song that he says his dream girl will like and begins to deviate from his programming. He takes a pair of sunglasses from a player who tries to rob his bank, through which he sees Free City from the player's head-up display (HUD). Guy speaks to Millie, who initially thinks he is another player named ""Blue Shirt Guy"" and not an NPC. She tells him to level up to above 100 before she will speak to him again. Keys and his coworker Mouser believe Guy to be a hacker disguised as an NPC and unsuccessfully attempt to ban him from the game. Rather than leveling up through destructive acts, Guy opts to perform good deeds, completing missions within Free City to reach level 102. His virtuous progression, which stands out from those of other players, results in ""Blue Shirt Guy"" becoming a worldwide sensation.Millie and Guy meet again when she breaks into the Stash, another player's well-protected compound that holds evidence of her source code. Guy helps Millie escape the Stash, and Millie is bewildered when Guy wants to kiss her. Keys realizes that Guy is truly an NPC, and that his self-awareness came about from artificial intelligence (AI) code containing Millie's personal preferences that Keys had included in Life Itself, which in turn had led Guy to develop a romantic interest in Millie. In addition, Guy's subsequent interactions with other NPCs have led them to develop self-awareness as well. Keys decides to help Millie retrieve their code before Free City is wiped from Soonami's servers to make way for its sequel, Free City 2, in two days. When Millie tells Guy the truth of his situation, Guy breaks off their relationship, telling her that he is in love with her. However, after talking with Buddy about the situation, Guy realizes that there was something more than love in their relationship and gains full sentience. Guy returns to Millie and agrees to help.Guy breaks into the Stash again with Buddy's help, where its owner, recognizing Guy, hands over the evidence. Guy's continued popularity threatens the launch of Free City 2, and Antwan orders Keys and Mouser to reboot the entire game, but Keys refuses and Antwan reboots the game himself.In the game, Millie finds Guy without any memories of his sentience, but recalling Keys' advice that Guy would need a reminder, she kisses him. Guy's sentience is restored, and he recalls the location of the Island, part of Life Itself that will not be protected from the pending data wipe and which is the only proof of Millie and Keys' original code. Antwan then tries to directly eliminate Guy and Molotov Girl from the game by raising their ""wanted level"" to maximum, but as Guy and Millie have persuaded the other NPCs in the game that they are more than their programming, they no longer respond to outside commands and refuse to interfere. Antwan then resorts to directly manipulating the game topography to kill Guy and Molotov Girl, while Keys makes his own changes to protect and direct them to the Island, broadcasting the effort to all of the Free City players who had been ejected from the game. Antwan fires Keys and then sends Dude, a muscular, unfinished copy of Guy developed for Free City 2, into the game. Unable to defeat him in direct combat, Guy puts his sunglasses onto Dude, the HUD distracting the far-less mature AI indefinitely.Antwan then enters Soonami's server room and begins destroying the game's servers with a fire axe in a last-ditch attempt to prevent his theft from being revealed, leading Mouser to discover Antwan's crimes and get fired, but Guy makes it to the Island before he can destroy the last one, an event that is seen by gamers all over the world. With the theft revealed, Antwan holds the remaining server hostage and demands that Millie abandon her lawsuit and surrender the Free City intellectual property (IP), along with the profits from the game. Millie, believing the real value of the game is in its programming, enthusiastically agrees; the game's inhabitants are saved.Without Millie and Keys' code, Free City 2 is a catastrophic failure at launch, Antwan is vilified by the media for his now-exposed crimes and he is arrested for theft and criminal damage. Keys, Mouser, and Millie start a successful new company with the recovered code to release Free Life, bringing Guy, Buddy, Dude, and the other Free City NPCs into it. Thanks to Guy, Millie realizes that Keys' code was in fact a love letter to her, and they embrace and kiss. Guy reunites with Buddy, and they begin to live their own lives in Free Life without having to follow their original Free City coding.","When Guy, a bank teller, learns that he is a non-player character in a bloodthirsty, open-world video game, he goes on to become the hero of the story and takes the responsibility of saving the world."

Siblings Finney and Gwen Blake live in the area with their abusive, alcoholic father. At school, Finney is frequently bullied and harassed. He has a friendship with a classmate, Robin, who fends off the bullies. A boy from another school that Finney knew, Bruce, is abducted by the Grabber. Gwen, who has psychic dreams much like her late mother, dreams of Bruce's kidnapping and sees that he was taken by a man in a black van with black balloons. Detectives Wright and Miller interview Gwen but struggle to believe her claims. The Grabber abducts Robin, as well as Finney days later. Finney awakens in a soundproofed basement. On the wall is a disconnected black rotary phone that the Grabber says does not work. Later, Finney hears the phone ring and answers it. Bruce's ghost, unable to remember his own name or who he was when he was alive, tells Finney about a floor tile he can remove to dig a tunnel to escape.The police search for Finney is unsuccessful. The Grabber brings Finney's food and leaves the door to the basement unlocked. Finney prepares to sneak out but is stopped by another boy on the phone called Billy. He explains this is a game that the Grabber plays, and he is waiting upstairs to attack Finney with a belt if he leaves the basement. Billy instructs him to use a cord Billy found to get out via the basement window. While climbing Finney breaks the bars on the window, preventing him from climbing back up. Gwen dreams of Billy being abducted and confides in her father about what is happening.Wright and Miller speak to an eccentric man called Max who is staying in the area with his brother. It is revealed Finney is being held in Max's basement, which he is unaware of, and the Grabber is his brother.

Her professor, Dr. Randall Mindy, calculates that the trajectory of the comet crosses that of the Earth and that an impact will take place in about six months, killing all life in the process. Accompanied by scholar Teddy Oglethorpe, Kate and Randall travel to the White House to present their findings, but are met with apathy from U.S. President Janie Orlean and her staff, including her son, Chief of Staff Jason. The attempt to inform the population through a television program also fails, though Kate's on-camera antics go viral online. When Orlean becomes involved in a sex scandal, she announces the threat of the comet to divert attention. The news is finally spread by the media and the launch of a spaceship that can hit and divert the comet, saving the planet, is announced. However, the operation is canceled mid-flight when Peter Isherwell, a tech billionaire and prominent funder of Orlean, discovers that the comet is composed of trillions of dollars worth of precious minerals that have become scarce on Earth. The White House plans to commercially exploit the comet by crushing it to reduce its size and recovering the fragments. Kate and Teddy immediately abandon the operation in protest, while Randall submissively becomes a prominent voice in advocating for the comet's commercial opportunities, as well as starting an affair with talk show host Brie Evantee.

He returns to Camelot and, after being scolded by his mother Morgan le Fay, attends a feast at the Round Table with his uncle King Arthur, who invites Gawain to his side. In a tower, le Fay performs a magic ritual. The mysterious Green Knight barges into Arthur's court on horseback and challenges the court: any knight who is able to land a blow on him will win his green axe. However, he must travel to the Green Chapel next Christmas and receive an equal blow in return. Gawain takes up the challenge. Instead of fighting, the Green Knight kneels and lowers his head. Gawain decapitates him. The Green Knight rises and lifts his severed head, reminds Gawain of the bargain, and rides off from the castle, laughing.Over the next year, Gawain's story is retold and his reputation grows, yet he spends his days drinking. When Christmas time approaches, the King reminds Gawain to uphold his end of the game. Gawain departs on horse for the Green Chapel, taking the green axe and a green girdle made by his mother, who claims that no harm will come to him so long as he wears it.During his journey, Gawain meets a boy scavenging a dead battlefield. He directs Gawain to a stream that will lead him to the Green Chapel. Gawain gives him a coin in return. Shortly after, the scavenger and two others ambush Gawain and steal the axe, girdle, and horse, leaving him tied up.

The Lord reveals that he has captured Gawain's fox, but releases it.Gawain reaches a stream where a boat is waiting. The fox impedes his way, imploring Gawain in a human voice to abandon the quest. Gawain refuses and takes the boat to the chapel, where the Green Knight is seated in hibernation. After waiting the night, the Green Knight awakens on Christmas morning. Finishing the game, the Knight swings the axe, but stops short twice as Gawain flinches. Before the third swing, Gawain flees and rushes back to Camelot.

This sets off a chain reaction of events, told in four parts.A Dark Spirit
Five months after the robbery, Patrick Hill (Jason Statham) joins Fortico Security as an armored truck guard. His manager Terry (Eddie Marsan) commends his references, and company trainer Haiden ""Bullet"" Blaire (Holt McCallany) nicknames him ""H"". Hill barely passes his training, and gets off to a rocky start with his colleagues, including ""Boy Sweat"" Dave (Josh Hartnett), Sticky John (Alex Ferns), Shirley (Tadhg Murphy), Stuart (Alessandro Babalola), ""Hollow"" Bob Martin (Rocci Williams) and Dana Curtis (Niamh Algar). H has replaced Sticky John in his job, who has been relegated to a desk job. Sticky John tries to get to know H, but H is not the social type. H is assigned to a daily detail with Bullet and Dave.
During a drop-off of $2.5 million in cash, Bullet is taken hostage. Hill convinces a panicked Dave to comply with the robbers' demands, before disposing of the entire crew with expert marksmanship and merciless efficiency. Before killing them, H wants to know whom the robbers work for.Questioned by FBI agents investigating the robbery (they are same guys who are investigating the robbery from 5 months ago. H denies there is any connection between the 2 robberies), Hill is assigned to desk duty as a precaution, but Fortico's CEO Blake Halls (Rob Delaney) returns him to working in the field.
The investigators Hubbard (Josh Cowdery) & Okey (Jason Wong) identify him to their superior, Agent King (Andy García), as someone the FBI has been hunting for 25 years, but King tells them to leave Hill alone. An associate Kirsty (Lyne Renée) delivers Hill a dossier of Fortico employee files, photos of Dana's family, and an autopsy report.Three months later, Hill and Bullet are waylaid in Chinatown, but the robbers flee at the sight of Hill. Bullet and Dave share their suspicions about Hill with each other. Dana takes H out for a date, and H questions Dana at gunpoint about her stash of $125,000. She claims to have stolen the cash from a liquor store pickup, and Hill shows her photos of her parents, threatening them if she is withholding information.Scorched Earth
Five months before joining Fortico, on the day of the first robbery, Hill is with his son Dougie (Eli Brown). Revealed to be working with his own robbery crew, Hill grudgingly agrees to monitor the armored truck's route, leaving Dougie in the car. But turns out that there were 2 teams of robbers after the truck. The 2nd team of robbers hijack the truck much before Hill's team, and spot Dougie nearby in Hill's car (which was parked right next to the spot where the truck was stopped). Racing back to his son, Hill watches as Dougie is executed, and is shot himself and left for dead. Three weeks later, Hill wakes up in the hospital. Blaming him for Dougie's death, his wife Jane (Eve Macklin) leaves him. He meets with King, who gives him a list of possible suspects and agrees to temporarily turn a blind eye.Hill is actually Mason Hargreaves, a notorious crime lord; determined to find Dougie's killer, Hargreaves and his men - led by Mike (Darrell D'Silva), Brendan (Cameron Jack), and Moggy (Babs Olusanmokun) - kill nearly everyone on King's list, without results. They even find a crime family with $2.5 M stashed in the house, but Mike and Moggy reckon its not the team they are looking for.
Mike voices his concerns about retaliation (& suggests that it was perhaps an inside job with Fortico), and Hargreaves agrees to lay low in London, but instead assumes the identity of Patrick Hill and joins Fortico to continue the hunt himself. It was Hargreaves' own crew who attempted the Chinatown robbery, until Mike recognized him.Bad Animals, Bad
Sometime before the first robbery, a group of disgruntled veterans - Carlos (Laz Alonso), Sam (Raúl Castillo), Brad (DeObia Oparei), Tom (Chris Reilly), Jan (Scott Eastwood), and their former sergeant, Jackson (Jeffrey Donovan) - decide to become thieves. They rob Carlos's wealthy client (Carlos was working as a security guard after his discharge from the military), resulting in only a few hundred thousand dollars. With help from an unidentified guard (working inside Fortico) who served under Jackson, they pull off a more ambitious heist ($6 M) of an armored truck. Turns out Jackson's crew and Hargreaves crew went after the same truck and events of the first robbery ensued; unaware of Hargreaves' identity, Jan needlessly shoots the guards, Dougie, and Hargreaves, who sees Jan's face.Liver, Lungs, Spleen & Heart
Five months later, the veterans reunite to steal over $150 million from the Fortico depot on Black Friday weekend. Bullet reveals to Hargreaves that he is Jackson's inside man (and he admits to playing his part in the first robbery), threatening him into cooperating. Jackson's crew boards H's and Bullet's truck, while Bullet had disabled the cameras. Bullet needed H to get the crew inside the depot. The crew takes the depot hostage, but an alarm is triggered; in the ensuing gunfight, Bullet kills Dana and Dave, and Hargreaves kills several of the robbers. Fleeing with Bullet and Jackson, Jan kills them to escape alone with the money.Jan finds a phone in one of the money bags, planted by Hargreaves to track its location. Hargreaves confronts him with Dougie's autopsy report, shooting him in the same places he shot Dougie. Abandoning the money, Hargreaves tells King his task is done, and is driven away.",A cold and mysterious character working at a cash truck company responsible for moving a lot of money around Los Angeles each week.

Madeleine shoots Safin, but he survives. She flees onto a nearby frozen lake and falls through the ice, but he rescues her.In the present, after the capture of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) (Bond's arch-enemy and foster brother. He is the founder and head of the criminal syndicate Spectre and is now in MI6 custody), Madeleine is in Matera with James Bond (Daniel Craig). Spectre assassins ambush Bond when he visits Vesper Lynd's tomb. Though Bond and Madeleine escape the assassins (one of the assassins tells him that Madeleine is the daughter of Spectre) (Madeleine also gets a call from Blofeld commending her on her sacrifice, while she was in the care with Bond, trying to escape), he believes she has betrayed him, and forces her to board a train out of Matera, ending their relationship.Five years later, the MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik) is kidnapped by Spectre (he got a call from Safin just before his kidnapping and told him to transfer the research files into a pen drive). The Spectre team is led by the same assassin Primo (Dali Benssalah) who attacked Bond. He makes Valdo steal a vial before kidnapping him.
With M's (Ralph Fiennes) approval, Obruchev had developed Project Heracles, a bio-weapon containing nanobots that infect like a virus upon touch and are coded to an individual's DNA, rendering it lethal to the target and their relatives but harmless to others. Bond has retired to Jamaica, where he is contacted by Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) and his CIA colleague Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen), who ask for Bond's help finding Obruchev. They say Obruchev is in Cuba, and that Spectre is gathering there, which cannot be a coincidence.
Bond initially declines, but after Nomi (Lashana Lynch) (A new ""00"" agent who entered active service some time after Bond's retirement and was assigned the 007 number), an MI6 agent and his successor as 007, tells him about Project Heracles. Bond is furious at M for some reason for keeping Obruchev on MI6 payroll and agrees to help Felix.
Turns out M had sanctioned the development of Heracles off the MI6 books. Not even the British PM knew about its existence.Bond goes to Cuba and meets Paloma (Ana De Armas), a CIA agent working with Leiter. They infiltrate a Spectre meeting to retrieve Obruchev. Still imprisoned in Belmarsh, Blofeld uses a disembodied ""bionic eye"" to view the meeting and release a nanobot mist to kill Bond, but it kills all the Spectre members instead, as Obruchev had reprogrammed the nanobots to infect them on Safin's orders. Bond captures Obruchev and rendezvouses with Leiter and Ash, who is discovered as a double agent working for Safin. Ash kills Leiter and escapes with Obruchev.Bond returns to MI6 HQ and meets M. Bond wants a meeting with Blofeld. Bond insults M, who flatly refuses to arrange a meeting with Blofeld.
Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) (M's secretary and Bond's ally) and Q (Ben Whishaw) (MI6's Quartermaster who outfits ""00"" agents with equipment for use in the field) arrange a meeting between Bond and Blofeld to find Obruchev. Q looks at the USB Bond recovered from Obruchev and tells Bond that the files are a database of DNA info of millions of people from around the world. Using this database, and the weapon, the holder of the weapon can eliminate their targets with precision. But Obruchev modified the coding to eliminate anyone related to the target, so entire families are wiped out. it is now a weapon of mass destruction.Safin coerces Madeleine (he approaches her as her new psychotherapist patient and reveals that he was the man who saved her from drowning in the ice all those yrs ago) to infect herself with a nanobot dose to kill Blofeld, with whom she has been in contact since his imprisonment (Blofeld has been pretending to be mad, and Madeleine was appointed as his doctor). Safin indicates that he knows about MAdeleine's daughter and threatens her, to get Madeleine to do his bidding
Bond is furious to learn that Blofeld has access to Madeleine.
When Bond encounters Madeleine at Blofeld's prison cell, he touches her and unknowingly infects himself with nanobots before she leaves. Blofeld tells Bond that he staged the ambush at Vesper's tomb to make it appear as if Madeleine had betrayed him, continuing his vendetta against his former foster brother. Enraged, Bond attacks Blofeld, unintentionally allowing the nanobots to infect and kill him.Bond tracks Madeleine to her childhood home in Norway and learns she has a five-year-old daughter, Mathilde (Lisa-Dorah Sonnet), whom Madeleine claims is not his. Madeleine tells him that her father murdered Safin's family on Blofeld's orders. She tells Bond that Safin's family owned an island, that was taken over by Spectre and now Safin has it back. Q determines that the Island is in disputed waters between Japan and Russia and has a chemical plant dating back to WW II.
Having avenged his family by killing Blofeld and destroying Spectre, Safin and his entourage are in pursuit of Bond, Madeleine and Mathilde. Though Bond defeats the thugs and kills Ash, Safin captures Madeleine and Mathilde.Q enables Bond and Nomi to infiltrate Safin's headquarters on an island missile base, converted to a nanobot factory, where Obruchev is mass-producing the Heracles technology for Safin to kill millions of people. Madeleine is separated from Mathilde. Bond and Nomi put explosives all around Obruchev's lab, when Bond is threatened by Safin to surrender, else he will hurt Mathilde. Bond has no option but to surrender and literally bow before Safin, for the sake of Mathilde, whom he knows is his daughter. But Bond launches a counter attack, when Safin is distracted and forces Safin to retreat with Mathilde.
During the ensuing gunfight, Nomi kills Obruchev by pushing him into a nanobot vat. Madeleine escapes from captivity, while Safin releases Mathilde to die in the explosions about to set off by Bond and Nomi. Madeleine finds Mathilde purely by chance..
Nomi takes Madeleine and Mathilde away from the island to safety; Bond stays to open the island's blast-resistant silo doors. He calls in a missile strike from HMS Dragon to destroy the factory, then kills Safin's men.Safin ambushes and wounds Bond by shooting him. He fights Bond infecting him with a vial containing nanobots programmed to kill Madeleine and Mathilde. Bond kills Safin and opens the silos. Bond contacts Madeleine by radio to say goodbye and tell her he loves her. Madeleine confirms that Mathilde is his daughter. Missiles hit the island, destroying the factory and killing Bond.
At MI6, M, Moneypenny, Nomi, Q and Bill Tanner (Rory Kinnear) (M's chief of staff) drink to Bond's memory. As Madeleine takes Mathilde to Matera, she tells her about her father, James Bond.","James Bond has left active service.

Emily is mortally wounded during a Boer sniper attack on the camp. Before she dies, Emily makes Orlando promise never to let their son see war again.Twelve years later, Orlando has formed a private spy network consisting of domestic servants employed by the world's most powerful dignitaries and has recruited his own servants Shola (Djimon Hounsou) (Merlin) and Polly (Gemma Arterton) (Gallahad) into it. The network's primary objective is to protect the United Kingdom and the British Empire from the approaching Great War. Conrad is eager to fight, but Orlando forbids him to join the British Army and persuades Lord Kitchener (Charles Dance), Secretary of State for War, not to let him do so.At the behest of Kitchener, Conrad and Orlando ride with Orlando's friend Archduke Franz Ferdinand (Ron Cook) through Sarajevo. Conrad saves the Archduke from a bomb thrown by Gavrilo Princip (Joel Basman), a rebel intent on sparking a war. Princip later encounters the Archduke's entourage again by chance and succeeds in fatally shooting him and his wife Sophie.King George of England, Tsar Nicholas of Russia and Kaiser Wilhem of Germany were cousins, kept in check by Queen Victoria. The death of Archduke Ferdinand will allow Kaiser Wilhem to move his armies against Austria and disturb a fragile peace. On Shepherd's orders, Erik, an advisor to Kaiser, goads him to ignore King George and attack Austria.
This quickly escalates into WW I and weakens Europe.Orlando visits the prison in Sarajevo and learns that Princip is part of ""The Flock"": a group plotting to pit the German, Russian, and British empires against each other. The Flock has its headquarters on an isolated clifftop and is led by ""The Shepherd"" Captain Maximilian ""Max"" Morton (Matthew Goode) (who is still working under Kitchener at the British War ministry), whose ultimate goal is to achieve independence for Scotland; among its operatives is Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin (Rhys Ifans), trusted adviser (The Tsar's personal physician) to Tsar Nicholas of Russia.On the Shepherd's orders, Rasputin poisons Tsar Nicholas's young son Alexei, only to cure him when Nicholas promises to stay out of the war. Conrad is notified of Rasputin's manipulation by his cousin, Prince Felix Yusupov (Aaron Vodovoz). Knowing the Western Front will be left vulnerable if Russia leaves the war, Conrad delivers this information to Kitchener and his aide-De-camp Major Max Morton, who set sail for Russia. Their ship is torpedoed by a submarine and sunk.Word of Kitchener's death reaches Orlando, spurring him (to first induct Conrad into his secret spy organization) to travel to Russia with Shola, Polly, and Conrad to deal with Rasputin once and for all. After a grueling close fight, Orlando, Shola, Conrad, and Polly successfully kill Rasputin during a Christmas party hosted by Prince Felix. Later that night, after celebrating his 19th birthday, Conrad expresses his determination to join the army, much to Orlando's dismay.At the Shepherd's orders, Erik Jan Hanussen (Daniel Bruhl) (An occultist and the Shepherd's second-in-command), an adviser to Kaiser Wilhelm II, sends the Zimmermann Telegram (German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann to the German Minister to Mexico, Heinrich Von Eckhardt, offering United States territory to Mexico in return for joining the German cause), hoping to distract Britain and the United States. Although the message is intercepted by British intelligence and deciphered by Polly, President Woodrow Wilson refuses to join the war, citing a lack of concrete proof. The Shepherd recruits Vladimir Lenin and orders his Bolsheviks to overthrow the Tsar and remove Russia from the war, sending an assassin to kill the Romanovs.Now of age, Conrad is commissioned into the Grenadier Guards against his father's wishes, but Orlando persuades King George V (Tom Hollander) (Percival) to have him assigned to London. Determined to fight in the war, Conrad swaps places with a soldier named Archie Reid (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), giving him the nickname ""Lancelot"" to send his father a message. Disguised as Archie, a member of the Black Watch, Conrad volunteers for a mission into No-Man's Land to retrieve information from a British agent wounded there. He is mistaken for a German spy (he gives his name as Archie Ried, but Archie mates say that they know Archie, and he ain't him) upon his return and executed at gunpoint, devastating Orlando, but the information he has recovered verifies the authenticity of the Zimmermann Telegram.After Wilson again refuses to enter the war despite Conrad's proof, Orlando learns that Wilson is being blackmailed with film footage showing him being seduced by the Shepherd's agent, Mata Hari (Valerie Pachner), and resolves to recover it. Upon defeating Hari at the American embassy, Orlando has her cashmere scarf identified as being made from rare wool only found in a specific mountainous region. Pinpointing this location as the Shepherd's base of operations, Orlando, Shola, and Polly head there and fight their way inside. The Shepherd is revealed to be Morton, who had faked his own death and killed Kitchener himself. Orlando and Shola fight and kill Morton while Polly recovers the film; it is delivered to Wilson, who burns it and prepares to mobilize American troops.A year after the war, Orlando purchases the Kingsman Tailor Shop as a front for his organization. Orlando, Shola, Polly, King George, Archie (Lancelot), and the U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. (Bedivere form the original Kingsman, each assuming code-names from the King Arthur legend to honor Conrad.

In 1964, at age 12, Estella attends school but is ostracized by the other students for her unusual hair-color and nefarious attitude. Catherine (Emily Beecham), Estella's mother, immediately sees potential in her due to her creativity in fashion and her affinity for dogs, especially a stray she picks up named Buddy. Due to her rebellious nature, Catherine pulls Estella from school and they decide to move to London to make a fresh start.Catherine attends a party hosted by Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson) and tells Estella to stay in the car. However, Estella ends up chasing Buddy and runs afoul of the Baroness' ferocious Dalmatians. As she runs outside, she sees Catherine speaking to the Baroness and the Dalmatians end up running Catherine over a landing and off a cliff to her death. Believing that she killed her mother, Estella takes Buddy and flees into the city, though not before losing her mother's important necklace. Estella is found by two street urchins named Jasper and Horace, as well as their one eyed dog Wink, who reluctantly invite her to stay with them as she dyes her hair red.Ten years later in 1974, the adult Estella (Emma Stone), Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) make a living as petty thieves and pick-pockets to make ends meet while Estella continues making designs for extravagant clothing at the local stores on Savill Row. For her 22nd birthday, Jasper and Horace get her an entry level job as a janitor for a Liberty fashion store. Her manager continues to belittle her as she tries to make suggestions that are swiftly ignored. While staying late one night, an inebriated Estella ""fixes"" one of the window displays which is seen by the Baroness in the morning. Impressed, she hires Estella to join her elite team of clothing designers. To expand her creativity, Estella also befriends the owner of a vintage clothing store named Artie (John McCrea) who admires her taste in fashion. Estella rises in the ranks and acts as a supervisor of sorts for the Baroness, but upon seeing her necklace being worn by her, and hears the Baroness' claims that it was previously stolen from her, Estella resorts to getting Jasper and Horace to help steal the necklace.Estella, wearing her natural hair color, and adopting the guise of ""Cruella"", crashes the Baroness' party while Jasper and Horace try to steal the necklace. However, the Baroness is wearing it and Jasper releases rats to distract the party goers. As the Baroness uses a dog whistle to command her Dalmatians, Estella comes to the realization that she used the same whistle to direct her dogs to kill Catherine. One of the Dalmatians ends up swallowing the necklace as Estella, Jasper and Horace flee in a stolen Panther de Ville.Now with a proper motive for revenge, Estella continues to taunt the Baroness by appearing at her lavish gatherings in over-the-top and stylish outfits and recruiting her childhood school friend Anita Darling (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) to use her journalistic connections to spread her publicity. Jasper and Horace begin to feel abused by ""Cruella"", but continue to aid her. The Baroness, growing more and more angered at Cruella, fires her lawyer Roger (Kayvan Novak) who returns to his side work as a pianist. Estella continues her taunting by kidnapping the Baroness' Dalmatians until one of the them gives up the necklace.Estella's schemes get more daring as she has Artie create more outfits and together they put on a fashion show in the Regent's Park. The Baroness, finally figuring out that Cruella is Estella, finds her hideout and captures Jasper and Horace. Estella is tied up as she burns the place to the ground while Jasper and Horace are arrested and blamed for her death. However, Estella is rescued by John (Mark Strong), the Baroness' valet, who had managed to secure the necklace which is a key to a box containing Estella's birth records. Estella finds out she is actually the Baroness' daughter. Being vain, the Baroness was disappointed with her pregnancy and asked that Estella be gotten rid of; her husband died of grief believing the baby (Estella) had died.

Angered over being lied to, Estella eventually makes peace with the truth by announcing her intent to avenge Catherine by defeating the Baroness and finally adopting the name Cruella.Cruella breaks out Jasper and Horace from jail and apologizes for not giving them credit while also recruiting Artie for one final scheme.

The candle Alma carries with her becomes magical and creates a sentient house, the ""Casita"", for the Madrigals to live in. Years later a village grows, protected by the Casita, and members of the Madrigal family are gifted superhuman abilities they use to help the villagers (""The Family Madrigal""). However, Bruno's gift of precognition causes multiple conflicts that lead to the family vilifying him, while Mirabel, Julieta's youngest daughter, is treated differently for having no gift at all.During the evening of Pepa's youngest son Antonio being gifted with the ability to speak to animals, Mirabel suddenly sees the Casita cracking, but her warnings go unheeded when the Casita is found seemingly fine (""Waiting On A Miracle""). Mirabel, resolving to save the magic of the Casita, goes around to investigate and question her family members. Her older sister Luisa - who possesses superhuman strength - suggests that Bruno's room may hold some clues to the phenomenon (""Surface Pressure""). There, Mirabel sees a cave of sand and pieces of a slab of opaque jade glass, which - when repaired - constitute an image supposedly showing her causing the Casita to fall apart. After Mirabel leaves, she discovers that her family members' gifts are starting to weaken (""We Don't Talk About Bruno"").At a dinner where Mirabel's oldest sister Isabela -who can make flowers grow at will - is to become engaged to neighboring villager Mariano Guzman, Mirabel's oldest cousin Dolores - who possesses superhuman hearing - admits to overhearing Mirabel talking with her father about Bruno's vision. Mariano's proposal gets ruined when the Casita once again begins to crack, causing Pepa - whose emotions control the weather - to conjure up a thunderstorm much to everyone's shock. Isabela then blames Mirabel despite the latter denying her involvement in the cataclysm. Amidst the situation, Mirabel suddenly catches a glimpse of a man who she then chases through a hidden passage in the walls, discovering that he was none other than Bruno himself, who never really left their house because he still loves his family. Mirabel convinces him to make predictions again and gets Antonio's permission to use the latter's room. Bruno makes another vision, which shows the Casita collapsing and an image of Mirabel embracing Isabela.Mirabel goes to apologize but instead learns of Isabela's burden of being perfect and her desire not to marry Mariano. Having poured out her feelings, Isabela's powers start to develop and both sisters reconcile (""What Else Can I Do?""). However, Alma discovers Mirabel's actions and thoughtlessly blames her for the family's misfortunes. Mirabel then finally snaps at her, saying how everything was truly all her fault for making everyone do things her way. Their argument suddenly creates a gigantic fissure that destroys the Casita while Alma's magical candle extinguishes in Mirabel's hands in her futile effort to save it, effectively stripping the Madrigals of their powers.Alma later finds a tearful Mirabel at the river where Pedro died and finally admits her fault of pressuring the family, forgetting that the real gift given was not the powers but the family itself (""Dos Oruguitas""). Both reconcile and, with Bruno in tow, reunite the Madrigals to rebuild the Casita, assisted by the villagers.

are sent by the Prime Celestial Arishem (David Kaye) (who created the first sun) to Earth on their star-ship from the planet Olympia, the Domo, to exterminate the invasive Deviants (who destroy intelligent life). The last of the Deviants are killed in 1521, and the group's opinions differ over their continued responsibilities and their relationship with humankind. Over the next five hundred years, they mostly live apart from each other, awaiting Arishem's return.In 1521, the team was in Tenochitalana. Thena starts attacking everyone and is diagnosed with the Mahd Wy'Ry. Ajak says her mind is crumbling under the weight of her memories, and the only cure is to wipe her memories clean. Meanwhile Druig is distraught at humans attacking each other, and questions Ajak's policy of not interfering in human wars. Druig leaves with the humans. And Gilgamesh offers to stay with Thena, without wiping her memories. Ajak allows everyone to go their own way.In the present day, Sersi and Sprite live together in London. After Sersi was left by her partner Ikaris centuries earlier, she is now in a relationship with human Dane Whitman, who works at the Natural History Museum. The trio is attacked by the Deviant Kro (Bill Skarsgård), with Ikaris arriving and chasing the creature away. Realizing the Deviants have returned (And the latest version has the power to heal itself, which they could never do before), they travel to South Dakota to reunite with their leader, Ajak, only to find that she had been killed by Kro.Sersi is posthumously chosen by Ajak as her successor, granting her the ability to communicate with Arishem. Sersi goes about bringing the team back together. Kingo is a Bollywood star. They find Gilgamesh and Thena in Australia. Gilgamesh says that Thena talk about everyone on Centauri-6 (her home planet) being killed in a giant Earthquake. Sersi knows that she experienced an earthquake in London, just before the deviant attack.Sersi figures out how to contact Arishem, who reveals that the mission of the Eternals was not to fight the Deviants but to prepare Earth for the ""Emergence"". Arishem explains that for millions of years, the Celestials have been planting their seeds on populated planets for new Celestials to be born, with the Deviants sent by them to destroy the apex predators of each planet to ensure the development of intelligent life. However, when the Deviants (who were also created by Arishem) evolved and began hunting the planets' native populations (and Arishem lost control of them), the Celestials created the Eternals to cull them. With the reversal of the Blip, Earth has reached the necessary population (whose energy the Celestial will absorb in order to be born) for the birth of the Celestial Tiamut, which will result in Earth's destruction. The mission was to grow the human population to feed the birth of a Celestial.Arishem explains that Celestials use the energy of the host planet to create new starts, keeping on the circle of life in the Universe. Arishem says that there is no Olympia and that Ajak and Sersi have helped the birth of many Celestials over millions of yrs. The Eternals are programmed (they are not alive) in the world forge, controlled by Arishem. The memory of each eternal is erased and reset after each emergence.Having learned to love humanity, the Eternals reassemble and decide to prevent the Emergence. They also realize that Thena is not mad and her past memories are from the previous Emergences. The plan is to put the Celestial to sleep till they can figure out how to let it emerge without destroying the planet.They reconvene with Kingo, Thena, and Gilgamesh before heading to Druig's residence in the Amazon rain-forest, where they are attacked by Kro and the Deviants. The group successfully kill most of them, only for Kro to kill Gilgamesh (And absorbing its power. and turning more humanoid with each killed Eternal) before fleeing (Gilgamesh was protecting Thena, who was having a Mahd Wy'Ry episode in the middle of the Deviant attack). After cremating him, they visit Phastos (who had given up on humanity after his technology had helped the humans explode the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945), who proposes for Druig to put Tiamut to sleep by amplifying his mind-control powers with the Uni-Mind, a connection between all the Eternals (thereby pooling the powers of all Eternals into a single Eternal). The team also finds Makkari, who has been living in the Domo.Ikaris reveals he was informed of the Emergence by Ajak centuries before and, choosing to remain loyal to Arishem (He believed in Arishem's design for the planet), fed Ajak to the Deviants six days prior to prevent her from stopping it (Ajak wanted to stop it as she believed in humans as they were able to fight Thanos and resurrect half the population of the Universe), before planting her body back at her house to feign ignorance. Sprite joins Ikaris as he flees due to her unrequited love for him, while Kingo also leaves the group as he does not wish to face Arishem or fight his teammates.Sersi doubts why she has been chosen as the leader since without Ikaris the team is weak. Thena tells Sersi that she loves the humans, the most and hence naturally she will be the most inclined to protect them. As such, she is the right leader for the Eternals. Phastos uses the sphere inside Sersi (which she uses to communicate with Arishem), to create the Uni-mind.Makkari locates the place of the Emergence at the foot of an active volcano in the Indian Ocean, and the Eternals battle Ikaris and Sprite before being attacked by Kro, who is then killed by Thena. Druig knocks out Sprite after she attempts to kill Sersi, and the remaining Eternals work together to subdue Ikaris while Phastos activates the Uni-Mind. Ikaris breaks free of his restraints and approaches Sersi to kill her but finds himself unable to do so due to his love for her. As both he and Sprite join the Uni-Mind, Sersi gains enough power to turn Tiamut to marble. Guilt-ridden, Ikaris flies into the Sun, while at Sprite's request, Sersi uses the remaining energy from the Uni-Mind to turn Sprite into a human, ending her permanent childlike state.Thena, Druig, and Makkari depart on the Domo to find other Eternals, while Sersi, Phastos, Kingo, and Sprite remain on Earth. Dane professes his love for Sersi and is about to reveal a secret about his family history when she, along with Phastos and Kingo, are remotely dragged into space by Arishem. Arishem states he is displeased with their treason but elects to spare humanity if the Eternals' memories show that humans are worthy of living. Vowing to return for judgment, he disappears into a singularity, taking the trio with him.In a mid-credits scene, Thena, Makkari, and Druig are visited by the Eternal Eros (Harry Styles), Thanos' brother, and his assistant Pip the Troll, who offer their help. In a post-credits scene, Dane opens an old chest inherited from his ancestors that contains the legendary Ebony Blade when an unseen person questions him whether he is ready for it.","The saga of the Eternals, a race of immortal beings who lived on Earth and shaped its history and civilizations."

Bugs finds one of the agents behaving strangely and discovers he is actually the embodiment of Morpheus and helps to free him from the node before it is erased. Thomas Anderson is a successful game developer, having created a trilogy of games based on his dreams of the Matrix, with the aid of his business partner Smith. He frequents a nearby coffee shop where he continues to encounter Tiffany, a married mother that reminds him of his dreams of Trinity. He has trouble separating dreams from reality, but his therapist consults him and provides him blue pills to help keep his sanity, though he later refuses to take it. He notices an intruder in one of his private instances of the game, but later finds that the instance had been deleted by Smith. Outside the Matrix, Bugs and Morpheus discover Neo's signal within the Matrix, despite the belief he had died. They connect Neo to Anderson, and realize he had been unconsciously running the node to allow Morpheus to be found. Bugs and her allies enter the Matrix to help locate Neo's body in the real world, and discover that Smith is Agent Smith, having been keeping close watch over Anderson's activities. Bugs helps Anderson to elude Smith and his new ability to take control over numerous individuals within the Matrix as a swarm. Bugs and Morpheus explain to Anderson what the Matrix is, and with his perception of reality already waning, Anderson agrees to be extracted. Neo wakes up in a pod, finding that a nearby pod contains Trinity, but machine entities, loyal to Bugs, recover him before he can free her. He is taken to the Mnemosyne and to the new human sanctuary of Io, where he is reintroduced to an elderly Niobe. Niobe explains sixty years had passed in the real world since the end of the Machine War, and the human survivors have allied with the machines to keep the system working against an Anomaly within it. Niobe takes Neo to meet Sati, an exile program he had previously met, who explains that the Anomaly was created after the Machine War and had somehow resurrected Neo and Trinity and kept them isolated from others. Though Neo wants to rescue Trinity, Sati warns that there could be consequences of this. Niobe orders Neo to remain outside the Matrix, but Bugs and others agree to defy her orders to try to help free Trinity. Coordinating activities in and outside the Matrix, Neo and Bugs enter the Matrix but are met by Smith and other exile programs would want to see the Matrix returned to its former self. While Bugs and her crew fight the Exiles, Neo faces against Smith, slowly recalling his previous abilities to bend the rules of reality within the Matrix. With Smith defeated, they take Neo to Tiffany's repair shop, but before Neo can talk to her, his therapist appears and slows down time. The therapist reveals himself to be the Analyst, a program that studies the human psyche but has since grown more powerful. He saw Neo and Trinity die at the end of the Machine War but created the resurrection pods as to study them more. Over countless iterations, he found that individually, the two were not special but when they worked as one, they had overpowered the system. Thus, the Analyst has been controlling the latest iteration of the Matrix as to keep the two near each other but preventing them from becoming close. As this has destabilized the Anomaly, the machines have prepared to reboot the Matrix again, but the Analyst has placed that on hold. He threatens to kill Trinity if Neo does not return to be reinserted in his pod. Neo and Bugs are forced to leave the Matrix when another ship loyal to Niobe brings the Mnemosyne back to Io. Neo pleads to Niobe to let him return to try to free Trinity again, and she eventually agrees. Within the Matrix, the Analyst invites Neo to a challenge, that if Trinity volunteers to go free of the Matrix, Neo can take her, but if she refuses, Neo will permanently return to the Matrix; Neo agrees. Trinity, as Tiffany, is brought to them and when the question is posed to her, her family appears. She initially seems to want to go with them, but soon rejects that reality and recognizes that she is Trinity. The Analyst prepare to kill them before Smith interferes, temporarily stopping the Analyst and giving time for Neo, Trinity, and the others to escape. Neo and Trinity race ahead to give Bugs and the others time to extract themselves, but the Analyst turns a swarm of controlled humans against them. The pair race into a skyscraper, and with nowhere else to go, the two jump with Neo expecting to be able to fly them away. Instead, Trinity has come to learn to fly and the two escape and regain control of the Matrix. In the aftermath, Neo and Trinity return to face the Analyst, assuring him that he will face dire consequences should he try to seize control of the Matrix again. Neo and Trinity both fly away to redesign the Matrix.","Return to a world of two realities: one, everyday life; the other, what lies behind it.

Mr. V accepts Ruby into the choir after hearing her beautiful voice and encourages her to be more confident.Mr. V pairs Ruby with Miles, a fellow student, for a duet at the upcoming choir recital. Their first performance goes poorly as they each prepare separately; Mr. V insists that they get together on their own to practice. Ruby invites Miles to her house to practice, but they are interrupted by Frank and Jackie loudly having sex in the next room over. Ruby later hears classmates in the cafeteria mocking the incident behind her back; Miles apologizes for spreading the story, but she wants nothing to do with him. She eventually forgives him and they resume their practice while kindling a relationship.Meanwhile, Frank and Leo struggle to make ends meet with the fishing business as new fees and sanctions are imposed by the local board. At a board meeting, Frank stands and announces that he is starting his own company to get around the new restrictions and sell his fish on his own, inviting other local fishermen to join in. The family struggles to get the company off the ground, relying on Ruby to talk to people and spread the word.Mr. V encourages Ruby to audition for Berklee College of Music and offers her private lessons to prepare. Ruby joins him for the lessons, but becomes increasingly busy helping her family with the business. Mr. V grows irritated with her constantly being late and making excuses, canceling their lessons. He chastises her for wasting his time and accuses her of not caring enough about music.While fishing one day, Frank and Leo are intercepted by the Coast Guard after failing to respond to ship horns and radio calls. They are fined and have their fishing licenses revoked for their negligence; they appeal and manage to get their license back on the condition that they have a hearing person on board with them at all times. Ruby announces to the family that she is foregoing college and will join the business full-time. Her parents are supportive, but Leo reacts angrily, insisting that they can manage their own problems without Ruby's help.Ruby's family attends her choir recital, and while they cannot hear her sing, they notice the positive reception from the audience around them. That night, Frank asks Ruby to sing a song for him while he feels her vocal cords, growing emotional. The entire family then drives to Boston with Ruby for her Berklee audition; they are not supposed to enter the audition hall, but they sneak up to the balcony to watch anyway. Ruby is nervous at first but gains confidence when she sees her family; she signs along with the song so they can understand what she is saying.Some time later, Ruby is accepted to Berklee; she shares the news with her family and Mr. V, who are all excited for her, before asking Miles to visit her in Boston sometime. Meanwhile, the hearing workers in the family's fishing business have been learning sign language, allowing them to interpret for the family. Ruby's friend Gertie drives her to Boston for college as her family sees them off; Ruby signs ""I love you"" to them as they drive away.","As a CODA (Child of Deaf Adults) Ruby is the only hearing person in her deaf family.

At a party, Patrizia meets Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver), a law student and heir to a 50% interest in the Gucci fashion house through his father Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons). Patrizia aggressively pursues the awkward Maurizio (she forces him to ask her out on a date), charming him into love. Rodolfo (who had a spy following Maurizio at all times) warns Maurizio that Patrizia is only after wealth and tells Maurizio that he will disinherit him if he marries Patrizia; Maurizio chooses Patrizia over his connection to Gucci, leaving the family.Patrizia and Maurizio marry, and Maurizio takes a job at the Reggiani trucking company. When Patrizia becomes pregnant, she sees her child as an avenue for familial reconciliation. She lets it slip to Maurizio's uncle Aldo (Al Pacino) that she is pregnant; Aldo is delighted by the news and takes the couple under his wing (he teaches Patrizia everything about the fashion business, including the cattle farms that generate the leather to the retail shops with the glamorous models). Aldo lives in New York but comes to Italy to host his birthday party. Patrizia and Maurizio attend, but Rodolfo backs out. Aldo asks Patrizia and Maurizio to visit him in New York. Patrizia sees how via NYC, Aldo is servicing a Japanese clientele. Aldo wants Maurizio to start playing a more active role with Gucci in his legal capacity (as a lawyer)Aldo introduces Patrizia to his unintelligent son Paolo (Jared Leto) (& his wife Jenny Gucci (Florence Andrews)), who aspires to be a designer within Gucci despite his lack of talent. When Aldo starts spending time with Maurizio, Paolo takes his designs to Rodolfo for sponsorship, and it told that he is totally incompetent and sends him away.
Thanks to Aldo, Maurizio and a terminally ill Rodolfo reconcile shortly before the latter's death. Rodolfo writes Maurizio back into his will but fails to sign a document transferring the Gucci shares to him before he dies. Patrizia forges Rodolfo's signature, giving Maurizio a 50% interest in Gucci.Patrizia starts to devise a plot to obtain a controlling interest in Gucci by acquiring some of Aldo and Paolo's shares (the two hold the other 50% interest). Patrizia finds that her maid has a Gucci bag and investigates to find a whole market of fake Gucci products. Turns out Aldo knew about this, and was the source of the fake merchandise, as he wanted Gucci to be an household brand, and not an inspirational one.She clashes with Aldo over the firm's clandestine sale of cheap ""fake"" Gucci products on the black market and begins to consult Giuseppina ""Pina"" (Salma Hayek), a psychic whose ad she saw on TV, for guidance. She manipulates Maurizio, who has little real interest in Gucci, into taking a more active role within the company. She convinces Maurizio that Aldo has to go as he has become an embarrassment to the brand.Paolo acquires proof that Aldo has been evading taxes in the United States; he gives the proof to Patrizia in exchange for her promise that he will be allowed to design his own line under the Gucci name and distribute it. Aldo is arrested by the IRS and sentenced to a year and a day in prison. Patrizia lies to the Italian police and tells them that Paolo is not authorized to use the Gucci trademark; the police stop his fashion show by force. Patrizia and Maurizio ask Paolo to sell them his shares, but he rebuffs them and cuts ties between them.Italian police ransack Maurizio's house and attempt to arrest Maurizio for forging Rodolfo's signature. Maurizio's family flee to Switzerland, where Maurizio meets his old friend Paola Franchi (Camille Cottin). After an argument between Maurizio and Patrizia, Maurizio decides that he is tired of his wife's influence on himself and the company. He orders his wife and daughter to return to Italy and begins an affair with Paola, which Pina seemingly senses.
When Maurizio's business plans harm the company, he seeks assistance from equity company Investcorp, through which he hatches a scheme to acquire shares of the company from a now-impoverished Paolo. Aldo returns from prison and immediately realizes what Paolo has done. When Investcorp offers to buy Aldo out, he refuses until Maurizio reveals himself as the deal's instigator. Dejected, Aldo sells the shares and cuts contact with Maurizio.Patrizia attempts a reconciliation with Maurizio, but he flatly ignores her. Later, he asks Patrizia for a divorce through his long-time assistant Domenico De Sole (Jack Huston), which Patrizia refuses. Maurizio recruits up-and-coming Texan designer Tom Ford (Reeve Carney) to revitalize the company's image through a new line. Ford's products are successful, but Maurizio has so thoroughly mismanaged the company (Revenues are dropping, company has debt, profits are elusive. Plus, Maurizio has bought many expensive items and billed it to the company as expense) that, by 1995, Investcorp's leaders feel compelled to buy him out for 150 MM dollars, replacing him with Ford and De Sole. Patrizia eventually grows so furious with Maurizio that she asks Pina to help her kill him. Pina puts Patrizia in contact with two hit-men. A few days later, the hit-men shoot Maurizio to death in broad daylight outside his office.Closing intertitles describe the fate of the remaining characters: Aldo died of prostate cancer in 1990 and Paolo died in poverty shortly following the sale of their shares to Maurizio. Patrizia (29 years), Pina (25 years), and the hit-men (26 years) are sentenced prolong prison terms following their arrest for murder. Gucci is fully acquired by Investcorp and successfully managed into the present (net worth of $60 Bn); no Gucci family members remain at the company.","When Patrizia Reggiani, an outsider from humble beginnings, marries into the Gucci family, her unbridled ambition begins to unravel their legacy and triggers a reckless spiral of betrayal, decadence, revenge, and ultimately...murder."

Night Shyamalan'],"The Kapa family - parents Guy (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Prisca (Vicky Krieps) and their kids eight-year-old Maddox (Alexa Swinton) and six-year-old Trent (Nolan River) - arrive at a fancy resort for a family vacation. After settling into their rooms, Trent befriends a young boy named Idlib (Kailen Jude), and they do activities like ask other resort patrons what their names and jobs are, and Idlib shows Trent a special code to decipher messages. Meanwhile, Guy and Prisca discuss that this is just one last trip they wanted to give the kids before they divorce, which is made worse because Prisca is suffering from a stomach tumor.At breakfast, a middle-aged doctor named Charles (Rufus Sewell) is sitting with his younger vain wife Chrystal (Abbey Lee), daughter Kara (Kyle Bailey), and his mother Agnes (Kathleen Chalfant). Nearby, a woman named Patricia (Nikki Amuka-Bird) is having an epileptic seizure, which Charles helps with while her husband Jarin (Ken Leung) also tries to help. Trent also spots Idlib, as they made plans to hang out again that day, but the resort manager (Gustaf Hammarsten) makes him leave the area.The Kapas, plus Charles and his family, all board a van that takes them to a private beach. There, Maddox recognizes a rapper, Mid-Size Sedan/real name Brendan Smith (Aaron Pierre), who was earlier seen with a female companion who went skinny-dipping. The kids all play together while the adults lounge on the sand. The girls find old dolls buried in the sand, left behind by other kids. Trent swims by a cave when he discovers the body of Brendan's companion, apparently having drowned. The adults examine the body, while Brendan is suffering from nosebleeds and is equally stunned at the discovery. Charles suspects Brendan of foul play, though he maintains that the woman only went for a swim and never came back. Not long after, Agnes begins to fall short of breath before she also dies.Jarin and Patricia arrive at the beach as well, but the people who brought them are already gone. The kids also start to experience something weird. Brendan explains to the adults that the woman he was with had multiple sclerosis while he has hemophilia, which explains his constant nosebleeds. Jarin and Patricia talk to Trent and Maddox, who have suddenly aged up into pre-teenagers (Trent now played by Luca Faustino Rodriguez, Maddox played by Thomasin McKenzie), along with Kara (now played by Mikayla Fisher).Several attempts are made to leave the beach, by going through the rocks that close off the beach from the outside, but all the adults that attempt to pass through feel a pounding in their heads before they black out and end up back on the beach. They also notice unusual things, like when Charles attacks Brendan with a knife, the slash mark heals within seconds. Not long after, Brendan finds that the dead body of the woman he was with has now fully decomposed to nothing but bones within hours, making them realize that there is something time-related occurring on the beach. Suddenly, the tumor in Prisca's stomach starts to cause her pain and distress. The adults try to help her, with them feeling around for the tumor at first and describing it as the size of a golf ball. They proceed to perform a surgery to remove the tumor, which has now grown to the size of a cantaloupe. The cut in Prisca's stomach heals rapidly after the procedure.Trent and Kara age up even more into teenagers/young adults (Trent now played by Alex Wolff, Kara played by Eliza Scanlen). What's more is that Kara has somehow become five months pregnant within a matter of minutes (after apparently having sex with Trent minutes earlier. The adults prepare themselves for the birth, which happens rather quickly, but the baby dies after a minute due to lack of attention. The other adults start to show more visible signs of aging, but Chrystal takes the process much harder than the others.Charles starts to lose his mind to schizophrenia, leading him to stab Brendan to death. The others take his weapon away while trying to come up with an alternate plan of escape. Knowing they can't go through the rocks, Jarin attempts to swim to find a way out. While this happens, Trent and Maddox come across a notebook left by a previous visitor, with names and medical conditions written down. They also notice what looks like people in the distance observing them.Maddox talks to Prisca about whether or not she and Guy are splitting up. Prisca admits that she was seeing another man. Although Prisca tries to explain herself, Maddox is angry with her. She goes out to the beach and attempts to be strong and find a way out herself, but she finds Jarin's body, apparently having gone unconscious and drowned. Upon seeing his body, Patricia suffers a fatal seizure. Kara then desperately tries to find a way out and starts climbing up the rocks to try and make it to the top, but before she can make it high enough, she too blacks out and falls to her death, leaving Trent devastated.It is now nighttime. Charles has become fully unhinged while Chrystal is also losing her mind at her rapid aging and declining physical state (she has grown a calcium hump on her back). Guy is also losing his eyesight, and Prisca is noticeably grayer. Guy and Prisca talk about the other man in Prisca's life, with Guy admitting he knew about him and wished that he did more to keep their marriage working, but he also notes that the other guy is a loser and that she deserves someone better. Charles then starts to attack Guy and Prisca, while Trent and Maddox are attacked by Chrystal when they try to look at her. She follows them into the cave and her body becomes twisted and contorted to horrible angles before she dies there. Prisca then slashes Charles with a rusty knife, causing an infection that rapidly spreads through his body and kills him.The Kapas then gather around the campfire and the beach. The now elderly Guy is having a hard time speaking and remembering things, but he essentially admits to Prisca that he still loves her just before he dies. Prisca then stands up for a moment but collapses and dies by Guy's side while both kids mourn their parents.In the morning, Trent and Maddox are now in their 50's (Trent played by Emun Elliott, Maddox played by Embeth Davidtz). Trent brings up a code that Idlib gave him, which he deciphered and figured out means ""My uncle doesn't like the coral"". The siblings spot a coral reef nearby and realize that it must be their way out. The two swim out there, but Maddox's clothing gets stuck on the coral. When the two don't resurface, Theo, the van driver that brought the families to the beach (director M. Night Shyamalan) reports to his bosses, from his observation post on a cliff overlooking the beach, that all members of ""Trial 73"" have perished.When Theo drives back to the resort and to a lab area, it is then revealed that the resort is a front for a medical research team named Warren & Warren that lures people with medical conditions to the beach in order to perform clinical trials for life-saving drugs, given to them in the cocktails served upon arriving. They know that the supernatural beach (possibly powered by the mystical coral) speeds up the aging process, so they reduce the trials to a whole day for better results. They believe they cured Patricia's epilepsy since she didn't have a seizure for eight hours, which is equivalent to about 16 years on the beach.The resort manager and others attempt to poach their latest victims until they are stopped by Trent and Maddox, who managed to free themselves from the coral. Trent finds a man he spoke to when he was still a kid, knowing the man is a police officer. He hands the man the journal found on the beach, which details the names of many missing people and their medical conditions. Idlib comes out and recognizes Trent even as an adult. Trent and Maddox reveal the truth to everyone while all the resort staff realizes they are screwed.Authorities come to arrest all the resort employees, while in the final scene, the officer takes Trent and Maddox by helicopter away from the island to be with their aunt, who is not ready to see that her niece and nephew are full-grown adults.","A vacationing family discovers that the secluded beach where they're relaxing for a few hours is somehow causing them to age rapidly, reducing their entire lives into a single day."

When they reach Steppenwolf, he attempts to taunt Diana by telling her she couldn't protect her sisters, and lies about killing her mother. While she and Aquaman fight him, Cyborg and Flash attempt to create a charge to destroy The Unity. Flash runs at the speed of light and creates the charge, but is disrupted by Steppenwolf. Before he can swing his gun to kill Cyborg, Superman joins the fight and knocks the villain against the wall. Flash is injured by a Parademon, which stops the charge. The Unity opens a portal where Darkseid overlooks the scene with DeSaad and Granny Goodness. After Flash heals, he runs the fastest that he can to recreate the charge, and with his touch, The Unity is undone. The power in the Boxes tried to manipulate Cyborg by saying he can be unbroken like he once was, even projecting an image with his parents. He knows he is greater than that, and with his power, the Mother Boxes are destroyed. Aquaman impales Steppenwolf with his trident and flings him upward, with Superman pushing him toward the portal before Wonder Woman decapitates him, sending his head and body flying toward Darkseid. Before the portal closes, the League looks at him victoriously. Darkseid notes Steppenwolf's failure and still plans to collect Anti-Life using ""the old ways"". The League then stands together as a team in triumph.EPILOGUE

Legend says that Wenwu found the rings in a crater or in a tomb.
He establishes the Ten Rings organization, conquering kingdoms and toppling governments throughout history. In 1996, Wenwu searches for Ta Lo, a village said to harbor mythical beasts. The people of Ta Lo are rumored to practice a martial arts style from the Gods.
He travels through a magical shape shifting forest to the village entrance but is stopped by guardian Ying Li (Fala Chen). Wenwu is not able to defeat Ying Li even with the rings.
The two fall in love, and when the Ta Lo villagers reject Wenwu, Li chooses to leave with him. They marry and have two children, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) and Xialing (Meng'Er Zhang). Wenwu abandons his organization and locks away the ten rings. When Wenwu removes the rings he also loses his immortality and starts aging naturally.
Li gives Shang-Chi a pendant to help him find his way home, if he is ever lost.When Shang-Chi is seven years old, Li is murdered by Wenwu's enemies, the Iron Gang. Wenwu dons the ten rings once again, massacres the Iron Gang, and resumes leadership of his organization. He makes Shang-Chi undergo brutal training in martial arts but does not allow Xialing to train with the others, prompting her to secretly teach herself. When Shang-Chi is 14, Wenwu sends him to assassinate the Iron Gang's leader (The one who killed his mom). After completing his mission, a traumatized Shang-Chi runs away to San Francisco and adopts the name ""Shaun"".In the present day, Shang-Chi works as a parking valet with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina), who does not know about his past. Shang has a normal life and spends his time with Mrs. Chen (Jodi Long), Katy's mother; Ruihua (Dallas Liu), Katy's brother and Katy's grandmother (Tsai Chin)
They are attacked on a bus by the Ten Rings (led by Razor Fist (Florian Munteanu), A member of the Ten Rings who has a machete blade for his right hand), who steal a pendant that Li gave to Shang-Chi. Katy realizes that Shang is a skilled martial arts warrior.
Razor Fist had mentioned Shang's sister to him and so he knew that Razor was going after her next.Shang-Chi flies out to meet his sister, fearing that the Ten Rings will go after her matching pendant. He reveals his past to Katy, who insists on helping him. They find Xialing at an underground fight club in Macau, which she founded after escaping from Wenwu at sixteen. Jon Jon (Ronny Chieng) is Xialing's announcer and her right-hand man at the fight club. Xialing is super angry at Shang-Chi for abandoning her with their father. The Ten Rings attack the fight club and Wenwu arrives to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, Xialing, and her pendant.They are taken to the Ten Rings' compound, where Wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a mystical map leading to Ta Lo (the village is protected by a shape shifting forest, but once every year it creates a direct path through the forest to Ta Lo).
Wenwu explains that he has heard Li calling to him and believes she has been held captive in Ta Lo behind a sealed gate. Wenwu says that the elders of Ta Lo are punishing Li for defying their wishes and for leaving with Wenwu. He plans to destroy the village unless they release her. When his children and Katy object, he imprisons them.
The three meet former actor Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley), whom the Ten Rings imprisoned for impersonating Wenwu. Trevor ended up becoming a ""court jester"" or Shakespearean fool for Wenwu, and his Hundun companion (a magical creature that Li captured from in front of the entrance of the village) Morris (Dee Baker), who offers to guide them to Ta Lo.The group escapes and goes to Ta Lo (Morris guides them through the open pockets in the shape shifting forest), which exists in a separate dimension with various Chinese mythological creatures. Guang Bo (Yuen Wah) is one of the leaders of Ta Lo and wants Shang and Xialing to return.
They meet Ying Nan (Michelle Yeoh), Li's sister, who explains the history of Ta Lo: Four thousand years ago, the universe containing the village was attacked by the soul-consuming Dweller-in-Darkness and its minions.
After conquering the other Universe and their planets and cities, the dark forces wanted to attack Earth's universe and Ta Lo's armies tried to stop it from reaching the portal to Earth's universe. They were saved by a Chinese dragon called the Great Protector who helped seal the Dark Gate to the Dweller's world. The dark gate is now protected by the Village and all the mystical creatures living in it.According to Nan, the Dweller-in-Darkness has been impersonating Li so that Wenwu will use the ten rings to open the Gate (only the ten rings have the power to open the gates). Shang-Chi, Xialing, and Katy join the villagers in training and preparing for Wenwu's arrival, using outfits and weapons crafted from dragon scales.
The villagers have access to Dragon scales which powers all of their weapons. The siblings are also given special suits made from dragon scales. Katy is trained in archery and Xialing is given a dragon scale knife as her weapon. Nan trains Shang in martial arts.Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive and attack. Wenwu overpowers Shang-Chi and forces him into the nearby lake, then attacks the Gate with the rings. This allows some of the Dweller's minions to escape, and the Ten Rings join forces with the villagers to fight them. The Great Protector revives Shang-Chi and bears him from the lake to battle the minions. Wenwu and Shang-Chi fight once more and Shang-Chi gains the upper hand but chooses to spare Wenwu. The Dweller-in-Darkness escapes the weakened Gate and attacks Shang-Chi. Wenwu saves Shang-Chi, bequeathing him the rings before being killed by the Dweller-in-Darkness.
Shang-Chi, the Great Protector, Xialing, and Katy manage to kill the Dweller-in-Darkness.
Afterward, Shang-Chi and Katy return to San Francisco, where the sorcerer Wong (Benedict Wong) summons them to Kamar-Taj.In a mid-credits scene, Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy to Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers while researching the rings' origin. They discover that the rings are acting as a beacon to something.
In a post-credits scene, Xialing becomes the new leader of the Ten Rings, training women alongside men, despite having told Shang-Chi that she was going to disband the organization.","Shang-Chi, the master of weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization."

He is awaiting a hearing for an unspecified incident that occurred on duty eight months ago but hopes to return to his beat afterwards. Joe fields the emergency phone calls while being hounded by a Los Angeles Times reporter asking for a statement about the hearing.
Emily Lighton calls, a young woman who cannot talk freely, and Joe deduces she has been kidnapped and is in a vehicle with her abductor. Learning they are in a white van on the freeway, the driver catches on and Emily has to hang up before providing any further details. Joe relays the information to the CHP, but they are unable to locate the van without more info. He then calls Emily's home phone number, speaking to her young daughter Abby. She tells him her mom was taken by her ex-husband Henry Fisher. Getting Henry's phone number from Abby, he uses it to get the van's license plate number. Relaying the plate number to the CHP, he then sends a LAPD patrol car to check on Abby and her baby brother Oliver. He also requests a search of Henry's apartment, but is denied due to the lack of a warrant.
Joe calls his estranged wife Jess, from whom he has been separated for six months, asking to speak to their daughter Paige, who is asleep. Jess will not agree to come to the hearing and asks Joe to stop calling. He then calls Henry, who has a record of assault, tells him he knows Emily is with him, demands to know where they are headed, but Henry hangs up. Next, Joe calls his ex-partner Rick, who is off-duty, and asks him to check Henry's house. Rick, meant to provide witness testimony at Joe's hearing, expresses concern that things won't go their way as federal agents have been talking to him.
Joe receives a panicked call from Abby and instructs her to open the door for two LAPD officers performing a wellness check. They see Abby has blood on her hands and that her brother Oliver - who she said was ""sleeping"" - is either gravely injured or dead. Rick breaks into Henry's apartment, finding piles of letters and documents. Joe asks him to find information that can help them deduce where Henry is going. Then he calls Emily and convinces her to pull the handbrake, but it fails to crash the van. He calls her back and learns that she is in the back of the van. She tells Joe that she believed Oliver had ""snakes in his stomach"" and that she ""took them out"". When Henry stops the van and tries to remove Emily from the back, she hits him with a brick and runs away.
Rick then calls Joe back and says he found papers in Henry's apartment relating to a psychiatric treatment facility in San Bernardino, where Emily had been a patient. Joe calls Henry, who was taking Emily back to the facility; she had been off her medication for weeks because they could not afford them. When asked why he didn't call the police when Emily hurt Oliver; Henry says he doesn't trust the system as no one was willing to help them before. Joe asks where Emily went, but Henry doesn't know.
Emily calls Joe back from an overpass, implying she is preparing to jump to her death, having realized what she did. He directs the CHP to her location as he talks her down from the bridge. To distract her, Joe reveals that he killed a man while on active duty; when Emily asks why, he says he doesn't know but that he was angry and wanted to punish the man for hurting someone. She asks if it was ""snakes"", and he agrees. Profoundly distraught, Joe tells Emily that her family still loves her and needs her and that he promised Abby she would come home. As officers arrive, Emily says she is ""gonna go be with Oliver"" and hangs up. Joe thinks she has jumped, but the CHP calls to tell him they got her to come down safely. He also learns that Oliver is alive and in the ICU at the hospital.
In the restroom, Joe vomits. He calls Rick, asking him to recant his earlier story and tell the truth on the witness stand even though it means a sentence of years in prison. Joe then calls the L.A.

Yelena is happy to be back, but Natasha is distraught at leaving Ohio and doesn't want to go back into the Red Room program.
Years pass, during which Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia while Romanoff defects to S.H.I.E.L.D. after bombing Dreykov's Budapest office and apparently killing him and his young daughter Antonia (Olga Kurylenko).In 2016, Romanoff is a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords (The Sokovia Accords are a set of legal documents designed to regulate the activities of enhanced individuals, specifically for those who work for either government agencies such as S.H.I.E.L.D. or for private organizations such as the Avengers. Established by the United Nations and ratified by 117 nations, the accords serve as a ""middle point"" between the Avengers' desire to secure world peace and the international community's concern over the repercussions of the Avengers' actions).The Sokovia Accords caused a schism in the Avengers. While Tony Stark supported the Accords due to his role in the Ultron Offensive, Steve Rogers recognized that the government having power over potential missions may be a terrible idea in an emergency and disliked the authoritarian nature of its stipulations, noting that signing the Accords would be ""surrendering the right to choose"". The schism came to a head when Helmut Zemo framed Bucky Barnes for a terrorist attack that occurred during the signing of the Accords.Combined with Zemo's exploitation of the schism, the Accords tore the Avengers apart, causing Stark's pro-Accords faction and Rogers' anti-Accords faction to destroy an airport as the former attempted to arrest the latter. The Accords caused the anti-Accords faction and Natasha Romanoff, who had been pro-Accords but betrayed Stark's faction knowing that Rogers would never stand down, to either become fugitives or be placed under house arrest, ruining any chance of coordinated defense.She escapes from U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) and flees to a safe-house in Norway supplied by Rick Mason (O-T Fagbenle) (An ally from Romanoff's S.H.I.E.L.D. past who is romantically interested in her).
Meanwhile, Belova kills a rogue former Black Widow but comes in contact with a synthetic gas that neutralizes the Red Room's chemical mind-control agent. Belova removes her own tracker, sends antidote vials to Romanoff, hoping she and the Avengers can free the other Widows, and goes into hiding.When Romanoff is unknowingly driving with the vials in her car, Red Room agent Taskmaster attacks her. Romanoff realizes that the Taskmaster is interested in a case, and escapes from Taskmaster and finds that the vials came from Belova (it was collected by Mason from Natasha's hideout in Budapest). There she finds Belova who reveals that Dreykov is alive, and the Red Room is still active. Black Widows and Taskmaster attack them, but Romanoff and Belova evade them and meet with Mason, who supplies them with a helicopter.
Belova says that the antidote was created by a Black Widow from Melina's generation. Belova says Dreykov has killed many little girls (only 1 in 20 survives the training, the rest he kills), and the black widow program needs to stop.Romanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison (he was imprisoned by Dreykov, but he doesn't know why) to learn Dreykov's location, and he directs them to Vostokoff who lives on a farm outside Saint Petersburg. There she is refining the chemical mind control process used on the Widows (This is what Shostakov and Melina has stolen from SHEILD in the first place, all those yrs ago). Belova tells Melina that her mind control chemicals were used on her, and she only managed to get out because of the antidote, while Natasha abandoned her. Melina also tells Natasha that she was not abandoned by her parents, she was selected by a program that assessed genetic potential in infants, and her parents were paid off. But her mom kept looking for her, threatening the exposure of the Red room, so Dreykov had her killedVostokoff alerts Dreykov and his agents arrive to take them, but Romanoff convinces Vostokoff to help them (by informing her how her mind control research has been used to kill and maim Soviet girls all over the world) and the pair use face mask technology to switch places. The Taskmaster arrives, everyone is sedated and taken to the Red room, which is a floating city in the sky.At the Red Room, Vostokoff frees Shostakov and Belova from their restraints. Dreykov sees through Romanoff's disguise and reveals that Taskmaster is Antonia, who suffered damage severe enough that Dreykov had to put technology in her head to save her, in turn creating the perfect soldier, capable of mimicking the actions & fighting styles of anyone she sees. Romanoff is unable to attack Dreykov due to a pheromone lock installed in every Widow but negates that by breaking her own nose and severing a nerve in her nasal passage. Shostakov battles Taskmaster while Vostokoff takes out one of the facility's engines. They then lock Taskmaster in a cell.Dreykov escapes as other Black Widows attack Romanoff, but Belova exposes them to the antidote. Romanoff copies the locations of other Widows worldwide from Dreykov's computer as the facility begins to explode and fall. She retrieves two surviving antidote vials and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell.Vostokoff and Shostakov escape via a plane (which loses control after they lose their vertical stabilizer and hence, they can't get back to the red room to rescue the girls) while Belova takes out Dreykov's aircraft (by destroying its engine with a pole, by the explosion throws her off the exploding deck of the Red room), killing him. Romanoff, who was watching this, jumps after her.
In free-fall, Romanoff gives Belova a parachute before battling Taskmaster. After landing, Romanoff uses one antidote vial on Taskmaster and gives the other to Belova along with the locations of the other mind-controlled Widows so she can find and free them. Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff and leave with Antonia and the freed Widows. Two weeks later, Mason supplies Romanoff with a Quinjet to use in freeing the imprisoned Avengers.In a post-credits scene set after Romanoff's death, Valentina Allegra De Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) blames her death on Clint Barton and assigns him as Belova's next target.",Natasha Romanoff confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises.

When they refuse to reveal the location of the tree, the Spanish destroy the village, and as punishment are cursed to never die and never be able to leave sight of the river.In 1916, Dr. Lily Houghton and her brother MacGregor detail Lily's research on the Tears of the Moon to an association of English explorers, explaining that the petals could revitalize medicine and aid in the war effort. The Houghton's request access to an arrowhead recovered by Dr. Albert Falls that Lily believes is key to locating the tree. When the association denies their request, believing the tree to be a myth and a female scientist unqualified to join their ranks, Lily steals the arrowhead instead. She narrowly avoids Prince Joachim, a German aristocrat who also wants the arrowhead and the tree.In South America, Frank Wolff takes tourists on jungle river cruises, which he embellishes with fake dangers and corny jokes. When his boat engine is repossessed by businessman Nilo, he attempts to steal it back. Caught in the act by Lily, Frank pretends to be Nilo and arrogantly tells her that the Tears of the Moon is a myth and that she will not be able to handle the dangers of the jungle, but changes his tone when he notices that Lily is in possession of the arrowhead. Frank's deception is revealed with the real Nilo shows up, but Lily hires Frank anyway after he underbids Nilo and bravely fights off a wild jaguar attack.Frank, Lily, and MacGregor depart on Frank's boat but are almost intercepted by Nilo attempting to get his engine back, mercenaries hired by Joachim to retrieve the arrowhead from Lily, and Joachim himself attacking in a German submarine. After they make their mistake, it is revealed that the attacking jaguar was actually Frank's pet Proxima, and Lily wonders if Frank can be trusted.Joachim locates the cursed conquistadors, whose bodies have turned to stone due to them traveling too far from the river, and have been infested over time by tree roots, snakes, and insects. Joachim frees them by diverting the river, and offers to help them break the curse if they help him to retrieve the arrowhead.As Frank, Lily and MacGregor continue down the river they become closer. MacGregor reveals to Frank that he was nearly disowned by his family due to his homosexuality, but Lily stood by him. Breaking into Frank's cabin, Lily finds photos and drawings of new inventions such as the automobile, but also discovers drawings of the arrowhead and research on the Tears of the Moon. Lily accuses Frank of wanting the tree for himself, but he explains he gave up searching for it a long time ago and believed it couldn't be found. They are attacked by a tribe of ""cannibals"" who demand the arrowhead, but this is revealed to be another deception by Frank working with a friendly tribe. Frank apologizes and says he was unable to call off the plan, but Lily rebuffs him. Trader Sam, the tribe's female leader, translates the writing on the arrowhead, revealing the location of the tree, and that it only blooms under a blood moon. The conquistadors attack and manage to take the arrowhead; Frank recovers it and gives it to Lily but is stabbed through the chest with a sword and falls to his death. Lily runs away from the river so that the Spaniards cannot follow her.The next morning, Lily discovers that Frank has miraculously survived. He reveals that his real name is Francisco, and he is actually one of the cursed conquistadors, unable to die or leave the river. The expedition to find the tree was originally a noble one to save the leader's sick daughter, but when the natives were attacked by the Spaniards, Frank switched sides to help the villagers. After years of fighting, Frank trapped the others in a cave away from the river. He then spent time searching for the tree to lift his own curse, but had been unable to find it without the arrowhead.An injured MacGregor stays behind with Trader Sam while Lily and Frank make the final journey to the tree. MacGregor is captured by Joachim and forced to reveal the location of the tree. Frank, Lily, the Germans, and the Spaniards all converge on the tree, which begins to bloom under the blood moon. The moon passes quickly as they fight, and Lily is only able to recover one petal. MacGregor kills Joachim, and Frank crashes his boat to block the river, turning himself and the other Spaniards into stone. Lily uses the petal to revive Frank and break the curse, only afterwords discovering that due to a shift in the moonlight there is one petal left for Lily's research.Back in London, the society has offered full membership to Lily, which she rejects. She shows Frank London and gives him his first driving lesson in her automobile as well as delivering a corny joke herself.",Based on Disneyland's theme park ride where a small riverboat takes a group of travelers through a jungle filled with dangerous animals and reptiles but with a supernatural element.

According to the wishes expressed in his will, publication of the magazine is immediately suspended. A scene shows Howitzer and his editorial staff discussing the publication of the following four magazine pieces.The Cycling ReporterHerbsaint Sazerac delivers a cycling tour of the town of Ennui-sur-Blasé, demonstrating several key areas such as the arcade, Le Sans Blague café and a pick-pocket's alleyway. He compares the past and the present of each place, demonstrating how much and yet how little has changed in Ennui over time.The Concrete MasterpieceJ.K.L. Berensen delivers a lecture at the art gallery of her former employer, Upshur ""Maw"" Clampette, in which she details the career of Moses Rosenthaler. Rosenthaler, a mentally disturbed artist serving a sentence in the Ennui prison for murder, paints an abstract nude portrait of Simone, a prison officer with whom he develops a burgeoning relationship. Julien Cadazio, an art dealer also serving a sentence for tax evasion, is immediately taken by the painting and buys it despite Rosenthaler's protests. Upon his release, Cadazio convinces his family of art exhibitors to put it on display, and Rosenthaler soon becomes a sensation in the art world. Privately, Rosenthaler struggles with inspiration, and devotes himself to a long-term project.Three years later, Cadazio, his uncles, Clampette, Berensen, and a mob of artists inspired by Rosenthaler, all frustrated at the lack of further paintings, bribe their way into the prison to confront him, only to discover that his masterpiece is in fact a series of frescoes in the concrete prison hall. Angered that the paintings are irremovable from the prison, Cadazio gets into a physical altercation with Rosenthaler, but soon comes to appreciate the paintings for what they are, and later arranges for the entire room to be airlifted out of the prison into a private museum in Kansas, owned by Clampette. For his actions in halting a prison riot that breaks out during the reveal of the paintings, Rosenthaler is released on probation. Simone and Rosenthaler maintain correspondence following his release.Revisions to a ManifestoLucinda Krementz reports on a student protest breaking out in the streets of Ennui that soon boils over into the ""Chessboard Revolution"". While the revolution initially is inspired by petty concerns over access to the girls dormitory, the traumatic military conscription of one student, Mitch-Mitch, inspires greater uprising. The students' cause spreads to the working people of Ennui-sur-Blasé.Despite her insistence on maintaining ""journalistic neutrality"", Krementz has a brief romance with Zeffirelli, a self-styled leader of the revolt, and secretly helps him write his manifesto and adds an appendix. Juliette, a fellow revolutionary, is unimpressed with his manifesto. After they briefly express their disagreement about its contents, Krementz tells the two to ""go make love"", which they do.A few weeks later, Zeffirelli is killed attempting repairs on the tower of a revolutionary pirate radio station, and soon a photograph of his likeness becomes symbolic of the movement. Years later, Krementz adapts the story of Mitch-Mitch's conscription, and Zeffirelli and Juliette's relationship, for a play at the National Theatre.The Private Dining Room of the Police CommissionerDuring a television interview, Roebuck Wright recounts the story of his attending a private dinner with The Commissaire of the Ennui police force, prepared by legendary police officer/chef Lt. Nescaffier. Nescaffier is a famous specialist in a kind of haute cuisine specifically designed to be eaten by working police officers. The dinner is disrupted when the Commissaire's son Gigi is kidnapped and held for ransom by criminals, led by a failed musician called The Chauffeur.The kidnappers represent the warring criminal syndicates of Ennui-sur-Blasé, and demand the release of an underworld accountant called ""The Abacus"", who possesses their shared financial records. ""The Abacus"" is being held in a solitary confinement cell at police headquarters. Wright recollects his own imprisonment in that same cell for his homosexuality, for which he was bailed out by Howitzer and offered a job at the Dispatch.Following a shoot-out at the kidnapper's hideout, Gigi manages to sneak out a message in Morse code to ""send the cook"". Lt. Nescaffier is sent into the kidnappers' hideout, ostensibly to provide both them and Gigi with food, but secretly the food is laced with poison. The criminals all succumb to the poison, and Nescaffier just barely survives (due to his strong stomach) after being made to test it first, but The Chauffeur escapes with Gigi, and leads the police on a chase. Gigi manages to escape out of the sunroof and reunites with his father. During his recovery, Nescaffier saves ""The Abacus"" from starving to death by preparing him an omelette, the prisoner having been totally forgotten in the commotion.Back at the Dispatch office, Howitzer tells Wright to reinsert a deleted segment. In it, a recovering Nescaffier tells Wright that the taste of the poison was unlike anything he had ever eaten before, before they commiserate over the state of being foreigners in France. Howitzer and Wright disagree on whether this conversation is important.In an epilogue, the French Dispatch editorial staff mourn Howitzer's death and start to write his obituary for the final issue.","A love letter to journalists set in an outpost of an American newspaper in a fictional twentieth century French city that brings to life a collection of stories published in ""The French Dispatch Magazine""."

The eggs were lost to time until two are found by a farmer in 1907, the third remaining lost.In 2021, Special Agent John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson), a criminal Profiler for the FBI is assigned to assist Interpol agent Urvashi Das (Ritu Arya) in investigating the theft of one of the eggs kept on display at the Museo Nazionale Di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome. He determines the egg on display is a forgery and the real egg has been stolen, so Das has the room locked down. However, before the room is sealed shut, international art thief Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) manages to escape, pursued by Hartley. A chase ensues, but Booth is more than a match for Hartley.Booth eventually escapes to his home in Bali with the egg, but finds Hartley waiting for him, along with Das and an Interpol strike team. They arrest Booth and take the egg into custody. Unbeknownst to anyone else, Booth's main competition, Sarah Black AKA ""The Bishop"" (Gal Gadot) is disguised as one of the strike team members and swaps the real egg with another forgery in the back of the vehicle. The next day, Das confronts Hartley (she says FBI has no record of Hartley and that Hartley received a $8 MM payment from an encrypted account the same day the egg was stolen in Bali) believing he's responsible for the egg's theft. As a result, she has him incarcerated in a remote Russian prison in the same cell as Booth.
Booth tells Hartley about an Egyptian Billionaire who is offering $300 MM for all 3 eggs.Shortly after arrival, they are brought to Black where she proposes to Booth they work together to find the third egg, revealing to Hartley that he does in fact know of its whereabouts. Booth declines her modest offer, and she departs stating she'll find the second egg; when she does, she warns that his share will be less. Hartley suggests he and Booth work together to beat Black. If Booth helps him imprison Black then Booth will take her place as the number one art thief in the world.The pair escape from prison and head to Valencia to steal the second egg, in the possession of notorious arms dealer Sotto Voce (Chris Diamantopoulos) who is having a masquerade ball. There, they encounter Black, who also intends to steal it. The three arrive in Voce's vault (before that Hartley saves Booth from Das, as she was also at the party, wanting to arrest them both. Throughout the escapade, Hartley is shown to be trying to win Booth's trust) where Hartley and Booth fight Black using a variety of melee weapons on display in the vault before she handcuffs them together. Voce arrives with his security detail and apprehends the men while Black reveals she and Voce are working together (Black had warned Voce that Hartley and Booth would try to steal his egg).
Hartley also maintains to Booth that he does not care about the 3rd egg, he just wants to capture Black, so that he can clear his own name and get his life back.They torture Hartley and, believing Booth has divulged the location of the third egg, Black double-crosses Voce and leaves for Egypt (a secret chamber in the Pyramid of Giza, which belonged to Cleopatra) where Booth claims it is. After leaving Valencia, Booth reveals to Hartley that the egg is in fact in Argentina, a location only he knows as it was inscribed on his late father's beloved watch which had once belonged to Adolf Hitler's personal art curator Rudolph Zeich. After the Third Reich fell in 1945, Zeich fled Europe for Argentina with the egg. The duo search the jungles of Argentina where they find a secret bunker. Inside are countless Nazi artifacts, among them the third egg.Black arrives to steal the egg from the duo at gunpoint, only to be interrupted by the arrival of Das and a team of local police. Hartley, Booth, and Black escape in an antique Mercedes, driving through an abandoned copper mine near the bunker, being chased by Das in an armored vehicle. Eventually, they exit near the top of a waterfall which they jump, landing in a lake at the bottom. Booth swims to shore with the egg, only to discover that Hartley and Black are actually romantic and professional partners, both going by the alias ""Bishop"". Booth surrenders the egg and they leave him handcuffed to a tree in the rain-forest.In Cairo, Hartley and Black deliver the three eggs to an Egyptian billionaire buyer, in time for his daughter's wedding (mirroring Marc Antony's original gift to Cleopatra). The gesture is overshadowed when the bride is more excited by the wedding singer Ed Sheeran. The wedding is subsequently interrupted by Das' Interpol raid. Alone on their yacht, Hartley and Black are met again by Booth who informs them that he told Das about their Cayman Islands account containing the $300 million payout from the Egyptian billionaire, which Das freezes. Booth also reveals that Interpol is on their way to capture them, but offers them a chance to escape if they help him with a new heist, which requires three individuals to pull off. They agree and escape, and Das places red notices on all three of them as they begin their heist at The Louvre in Paris.",An Interpol agent successfully tracks down the world's most wanted art thief with help from a rival thief.

When the carnival geek becomes sick, carnival owner Clem enlists Stan to help him dispose of him. Stan is disturbed at how any man could sink to the level of performing as a geek, living in a cage in squalor and biting off the heads of live chickens to appease the crowd. Clem explains that he seeks out alcoholic or drug-addicted men with troubled pasts, and lures them in with promises of a ""temporary"" job and opium-laced alcohol. He then uses their dependence on alcohol to keep them around, then makes a speech about how he needs a ""real"" geek and lets them consider quitting, which would mean severe withdrawal from the drugs; the result, he says, is that they choose to stay. He shows Stan where he stores the moonshine he brews to control some of the carnies, but warns him not to mistake it for the wood alcohol he stores nearby. Stan works with clairvoyant act ""Madame Zeena"" and her alcoholic husband, Pete. Zeena and Pete use cold reading and an ingenious coded language system to make it appear that she has extraordinary mental powers, which Pete begins teaching to Stan. He and Zeena warn Stan not to ever use these skills to continue leading patrons on when it comes to the dead, what they call a ""spook show""; they always inform customers afterward that the show is a deception, otherwise people get hurt. Meanwhile, Stan becomes attracted to fellow performer Molly, and approaches her with an idea for a two-person act away from the carnival. One night, Stan accidentally gives Pete the wrong bottle and the old man dies from consuming wood alcohol. In the aftermath, Stan swears his love to Molly and reiterates his plan to her. She accepts and they leave the carnival behind. Two years later, Stan has successfully reinvented himself as ""The Great Stanton"", a psychic act for the wealthy urban elite of Chicago, along with Molly as his assistant, using Zeena and Pete's techniques. During a performance, their act is interrupted by psychologist Dr. Lilith Ritter, who attempts to expose their code system. Stan's cold reading allows him to best Ritter, keeping their act safe. He is later approached by the wealthy Judge Harrington, who employed Ritter to test Stan. He is now convinced of Stan's abilities and offers to pay him handsomely to allow him and his wife to communicate with their dead son. Despite Molly's objections to the ""spook show,"" Stan agrees. Ritter invites Stan to her office. Knowing he is a con man, she is nevertheless intrigued by his manipulative skill. Through her recorded sessions with her clients, she has accumulated sensitive information about various members of Chicago's social elite. Finding themselves to be kindred spirits, she and Stanton begin an affair and they conspire together to manipulate Harrington, with Ritter secretly providing private information to fuel his charade. She also begins therapy sessions with Stan, who reveals his guilt over Pete's death, and his hatred of his alcoholic father, who he killed in their home before joining the carnival. Harrington introduces Stan to the powerful Ezra Grindle. Grindle wishes to speak to his long lost illegitimate lover, Dory, who died of a forced miscarriage. Despite warnings from Ritter that Grindle is dangerous, Stan begins scamming Grindle and begins drinking. Molly becomes increasingly uncomfortable, and upon learning of the affair with Ritter, leaves Stan. He begs her to stay, but she refuses, only agreeing to help him one last time. She poses as Dory for Stan's ultimate act: conjuring Dory from afar for Grindle. However, he loses control of Grindle, who grabs Molly and reveals himself to be a violent abuser of women, plagued by his guilt over Dory. Upon realizing that ""Dory"" is a fake, he violently threatens Stan, who kills him. They flee and Molly leaves Stan for good. Stan goes to Ritter for help, but discovers she has been scamming him all along, keeping the money for herself. She expresses disappointment in realizing that he was nothing more than a base money-driven criminal. She contacts the police and threatens to use her recordings of their sessions as evidence that he is mentally disturbed should he try to implicate her. Stan attacks her, but she shoots him and he flees. A wanted man, injured, and with nowhere else to go, Stanton wanders around for years as a hobo, sunk in alcoholism. At his limit, he tries to get a job at another carnival. The owner turns him away, but at the last minute offers him a drink and a ""temporary"" job as the new geek. Finally broken, Stan agrees, saying, ""Mister, I was born for it,"" as he laughs and then begins to sob.",A grifter working his way up from low-ranking carnival worker to lauded psychic medium matches wits with a psychologist bent on exposing him.

The gangs are too proud to care, and Jet leader Riff (Mike Faist) proposes a ""rumble"" (fight) between the two gangs. He approaches his friend Tony (Ansel Elgort), who is on parole, for help.

While he is watching the World Cup at a Christmas party, soldiers from the year 2051 arrive to warn that humanity is on the brink of extinction due to a war with alien invaders: the Whitespikes. The Whitespikes will arrive in November 2048 and kill the majority of humanity three years later. In response, members of the world's militaries are sent into the future through a wormhole device called the Jumplink, but fewer than 30% survive deployment to return in seven days, prompting a worldwide draft.After a year of the draft and a growing anti-war movement, there is little hope for humanity's survival. Dan receives a notice that he has been drafted and reports with other draftees to basic training. Dan deduces with fellow draftee Charlie that in order to prevent a paradox, those drafted have already died before the war starts. The draftees are sent forward in time to a battlefield in Miami Beach but few survive, having been dropped in the incorrect location above the city. The draftees are ordered by Colonel Forester to rescue nearby lab personnel before the area is sterilized. The draftees discover the lab personnel dead but recover their research. Dan radios to command about the situation, and he is told that no help will be sent to rescue the stranded troops. Many of the draftees are killed except for Dan, Charlie, and Dorian, a battle-hardened soldier on his third deployment to the future.The survivors wake up in a military encampment in the Dominican Republic. Dan is asked to report to Colonel Forester, who turns out to be his grown daughter Muri. She requests him to accompany her on a mission to capture a female Whitespike, which are rarer than the males typically encountered. They trap and cage the female, only to have hundreds of males descend on their position. As the helicopter with the female lifts off, Dan and Muri escape to a beach and radio for rescue. Muri reveals that Dan, dissatisfied with his life after losing the job, he abandons his family and dies in a car crash in 2030. Dan, Muri and the female Whitespike are transported to a fortified oil rig close to Port Nelson, where the Jumplink is located.Dan and his daughter work on a toxin that can kill the captured female. They find a match for killing the aliens, just as they start to breach the base. As the Whitespikes attack the base, the formerly captive female spears Colonel Forester with one of her spikes. She plummets from the gantry and Dan follows her off just before he is transported back to the past with the toxin to mass produce it. Dan tries to give the toxin to the military so it can be sent back to the future, but learns that the Jumplink is offline, having been destroyed by the Whitespikes. The world has become chaotic with the news that the Jumplink is offline, foretelling the war was lost.While Dan brainstorms with his wife, Emmy, she deduces that the Whitespikes did not arrive in 2048, but came much earlier. Dan consults with Charlie and Martin, a high school student with an interest in volcanoes and they theorize that the Whitespikes have been on Earth since the Millennium Eruption in the year 946, and global warming caused their release when they thawed out and emerged from under the ice caps. Dan leads a mission to Russia with Charlie, Dorian, a few surviving future soldiers, and his estranged father James to prove his theory. The team finds a crashed alien ship at the Academy of Sciences Glacier on Komsomolets Island. They debate telling the world about the problem, but decide to end the threat right then and there. Once inside, they realize that the Whitespikes are not aliens themselves, but rather bio-engineered organisms possibly used as a planet-clearing weapon or cattle by another alien race. The team injects several of the dormant Whitespikes with the toxin; this kills those injected but wakes the others, and most of the team is killed. Terminally ill with cancer and wanting to die on his own terms, Dorian remains behind to blow up the ship with C-4 and the explosion kills all but one of the Whitespikes. Dan and his father track down the one female that has escaped, leaving them and Charlie as the team's only survivors.Content knowing that the war is averted and humanity is saved, Dan brings James home to meet his wife and daughter, determined not to make the same mistakes that Muri had warned him about from her future.",A family man is drafted to fight in a future war where the fate of humanity relies on his ability to confront the past.

He and his associates, Abel (Tom Hughes) and Leona (Joana Ribeiro) speak about ""the Egg,"" which Treadway stole from Bathurst. Treadway tells Abel that if he does not survive, the latter must remember to ""look inside"". He drives off a bridge, jumping from his car in mid-air and onto a crane 150 feet away. However, Treadway watches helplessly as Bathurst arrives and kills Abel and Leona.In 2020, Evan McCauley (Mark Wahlberg) suffers from schizophrenia. Because of past institutionalization and violent behavior, he cannot get a job. Needing medicines, he forges a Katana for a local gangster, even though he was never trained as a blade-smith. After the deal goes south (client is a psychopath and tries to cut the hand of his prostitute to test the Katana, forcing Evan to intervene), Evan makes his escape but is later arrested. A man at the police station introduces himself as Bathurst (Chiwetel Ejiofor). He starts to refer to Evan as Treadway and claims they have known each other for centuries. Bathurst shows a lot of items to Treadway from his past lives, in a bid to revive his memories.When Bathurst gets Evan to remember things about his past life, a car slams into the room. Evan's rescuer is Nora Brightman (Sophie Cookson) (who manages to shake off Bathurst in a car chase), who takes Evan to the group she is part of. Bryan Porter (Toby Jones) is the Director of Operations and helps Nora in her field ops.
There are about 500 individuals in the world who can remember all their past lives, known as the Infinites. Two opposing factions have developed among the Infinites: The Believers and the Nihilists. The Believers, such as Nora, think remembrance is a gift bestowed on them by a higher power in order to make the world better. Nihilists like Bathurst consider it a curse. They think the Infinites are condemned to witness humanity self-destruct. They want to be free of this (cycle of reincarnation) and exterminate all life on Earth.Both factions believe that Evan is Treadway's reincarnation. Hidden in his memory of his past life is the location of the Egg, the device that was created to end the world (it attacks the DNA of every living thing on the planet. If nothing is alive, there is nothing to reincarnate into) (In his past life, Treadway attacked Bathurst's lab and stole the egg, and killed his Einstein, leaving him no way to recreate it).
The Believers must retrieve his memory and secure the Egg before Bathurst gets Evan and tortures the information out of him. As Nora, Leona's reincarnation, explains to Evan, the Infinites start to remember things when they are young. By puberty, they have recalled everything. This is why Evan was diagnosed schizophrenic.
Meanwhile Bathurst finds Bryan's location in NYC and attacks him. He brute forces his encryption to find the location of Evan. Bathurst kills Bryan with a Dethroner, which destroys the memories (by downloading them into a digital chip) and stops the reincarnation.Despite their progress, Evan struggles to regain Treadway's memories, revealed to be the result of trauma endured from accidents earlier in life (which left a steel plate embedded in his head). Nora decides to take Evan to the Artisan in London, and shortly thereafter Bathurst attacks the Believer's home base, but finds nothing.
However, after a session inside Artisan's (Jason Mantzoukas) machine, Evan unlocks his memories.Treadway was killed by the previous Bathurst not long after Abel and Leona. The Believers retrieved his body and took it back to the Hub, where it is kept in a chamber. Evan recalls that he had slashed open his belly and put the Egg inside. Bathurst used to be a comrade of Treadway. They spent centuries fighting beside each other. However, Bathurst became disillusioned with the Believers' mission and began attempting to end the reincarnation. The Egg was the product of that search. When activated, it will attack the DNA of living beings and destroy life.
Bathurst spies on the Believers and now knows that the egg was hidden inside Treadway's body from his previous life. Bathurst attacks the Artisan's facility, but Treadway and Nora manage to escape as Kovic (Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson) stays behind to fight the Nihilists and give them a chance to get away.Bathurst then returns to the Hub and retrieve's Treadway's previous life's body and transports it to Scotland. He finds the Egg inside the body, as expected.
Nora attacks Bathurst's HQ but fails to kill him. Evan was injured in the previous attack and was being treated by the Artisan. He follows Nora, to join the fight. Nora and Evan join forces to attack Bathurst's HQ, where he prepares the Egg for launch.
As Evan gets near, Bathurst gets on a plane with the Egg and Evan follows him. Bathurst shoots Evan with the Dethroner, but the bullet hits the steel plate in his skull, giving Evan the chance to counterattack. In the ensuing fight, the device with the Egg inside it flies out of a plane. Evan jumps after it and Bathurst follows. The two fight in mid-air, and Evan manages to stop the countdown by pulling out the Egg. He shoots Bathurst with a Dethroner, which ensures that Bathurst will not be reborn. Evan drowns in the ocean with the egg.

The convoy's cargo, a zombie, escapes, killing and infecting several soldiers before heading into the city. There, they infect most of the city's population. After a military intervention fails, the government quarantines the city.Six years later, casino owner Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) and his associate Martin (Garret Dillahunt) approach former Las Vegas resident and mercenary Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) about a job to recover $200 million from his casino vault in Las Vegas before the military deploys a tactical nuclear strike on the city. Tanaka offers Ward $50 million as payment for the job.
Ward agrees (after his own daughter gets infected, and he had to kill her with his own hands, and he has nothing left to fight for) and recruits his former teammates Maria Cruz (Ana De La Reguera) and Vanderohe (Omari Hardwick), along with helicopter pilot Marianne Peters (Tig Notaro), German safe-cracker Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighofer), and Chicano sharpshooter Mikey Guzman (Raúl Castillo), who brings along his associate Chambers (Samantha Win). Martin joins the team to give them access to the casino.Ward secretly offers to keep $15 million each for himself, Maria and Vanderohe, as they all go way back to their time in the military. Peters is offered $ 2 million. Mikey signs up for $500,000. Ludwig is offered $250,000.
Ward's estranged daughter Kate (Ella Purnell), who works at a quarantine camp, directs them to Lilly (Nora Arnezeder), a smuggler familiar with the city, who also recruits Burt Cummings (Theo Rossi), an abusive camp security guard (for $20,000). Ward offers Kate the entire portion of his $15 million cut in exchange for her help.
When Kate learns Lilly escorted her friend Geeta (Huma Qureshi) into Las Vegas, Kate insists on joining the team over Ward's objections.
Geeta was also looking for the casino money (though only 5000 $$) to buy her way out of the quarantine camp for herself and her kids.After an encounter with a tiger zombie upon entering Las Vegas, Lilly wounds Cummings and explains that a group of intelligent zombies known as ""Alphas"" will allow safe passage in exchange for a sacrifice. An Alpha female known as the Queen (Athena Perample) takes Cummings away to the Olympus casino, where the Alpha leader Zeus (Richard Cetrone) infects him. Lilly leads the team to a building full of hibernating, normal zombies. They wake up only when light is flashed into their eyes. Ward creates a path through the zombies with glow sticks. When Chambers accuses Martin of ulterior motives, he diverts her off the path, and she wakes the zombies. After she is surrounded and bitten, Guzman shoots the gasoline canister on her back, killing her and the surrounding zombie horde.Arriving at Bly's casino (Dieter finds another set of blueprints for the vault, which indicates that Tanaka had sent other teams before them. Martin says he has no knowledge of this), Ward and Kate turn on the power, Peters prepares a helicopter on the roof, and Dieter works on the vault. Meanwhile Geeta is revealed to be alive and in custody of Zeus. Zeus keeps captured humans alive and takes them one by one for feasting.Martin and Lilly stay outside under the pretense of keeping watch but instead lure the Queen into the open. Martin beheads her and takes her head. Turns out Lilly was working for Martin and Tanaka the whole time, but she thought Martin only needed a vial of the queen's blood. Martin says his bosses want to use the queen's head to have the power to create their own zombie army.
Zeus discovers her body and returns her to the Olympus casino, revealing that the Queen was pregnant with a zombie fetus. Enraged, Zeus directs the Alphas to the casino. A news report reveals the government has brought forward the nuclear strike, giving the team approximately 90 minutes.
As Dieter opens the vault, Ward discovers Kate had left to look for Geeta. As Ward and Cruz are about to search for her, the Alphas appear and kill Cruz.Martin traps the team in the basement, explaining that Bly cares only about the zombie head, which can create a zombie army for the government and is worth more than the money in the vault. When he steps outside, he discovers Lilly stole the Queen's head, and the tiger mauls him to death. Vanderohe attempts to fight Zeus (who had broken into the vault basement) but is easily overpowered. Dieter sacrifices himself to get Vanderohe into the vault safely. Ward, Lilly, and Guzman make it to the lobby, where zombies attack them and swarm Guzman, who detonates his grenades, killing the zombies at the cost of his own life and destroying the money he carried. Lilly and Ward head to the roof for the copter.Zeus come out of the basement and heads to the roof and confronts them on the roof. Lilly distracts him with the Queen's head as Ward and Peters escape. Zeus fatally impales Lilly, who destroys the Queen's head by dropping it off the roof.Peters takes Ward to the Olympus casino to retrieve Kate. Inside, Kate finds Geeta and kills the infected Cummings (who had turned into a zombie by now). Zeus chases them onto Peters' helicopter, and Ward accidentally shoots Peters, causing the helicopter to fly haphazardly. Zeus overpowers Ward and bites him. As the nuke destroys Las Vegas, Zeus is distracted by the bomb flash, and Ward kills him. The nuke's shock-wave causes the helicopter to crash, killing Peters and Geeta. Kate survives and finds Ward, who gives Kate money to start a new life before turning into a zombie. Kate kills him and breaks down in tears as a rescue helicopter arrives.Having survived the blast, Vanderohe exits the vault with the remaining money and later rents a plane to take him to Mexico City. On the flight, he discovers that he has been bitten.","Following a zombie outbreak in Las Vegas, a group of mercenaries take the ultimate gamble, venturing into the quarantine zone to pull off the greatest heist ever attempted."

One of the boys, Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman), sees the photographer's assistant, Alana Kane (Alana Haim), and becomes smitten with her. He tries to talk to her, though she seems disinterested due to the fact that she is 25 and he is 15. Gary tells Alana that he is an actor, and he eventually succeeds in getting her to agree to hang out with him, but not as a date.Gary and Alana meet at a restaurant that he frequents since he appears to know the manager. The two discuss their jobs, and Gary mentions that he also works with his mother at a public relations company. Gary assures Alana that they are not going to forget each other. They walk home, and we see Alana lives with her parents and two sisters (all played by Haim's real family), while Gary lives with his brother Greg (Milo Herschlag).Gary works with his mom, Momma Anita (Mary Elizabeth Ellis), and they meet with a restaurant owner, Jerry Frick (John Michael Higgins), and his wife Mioko (Yumi Mizui), over a new Japanese restaurant they are trying to open. Jerry speaks with a accent racist accent to his wife. Later on, Anita tells Gary that she can't accompany him for a trip to New York where he will be featured on auditions and a variety show.Alana accompanies Gary to New York, where he rejoins his movie partners from the film ""Under One Roof"", where he starred as one of many siblings along with renowned actress Lucille Dolittle (Christine Ebersole). During the show, Gary hits Lucille over the head with a pillow, and when being interviewed, he makes a joke about ""doing three beavers"". Lucille later angrily chastises him and hits him. Afterward, Gary meets with an agent, Gale (Maya Rudolph), and does a commercial for a vest. While this happens, Alana befriends another actor named Lance (Skyler Gisondo).Upon returning to California, Alana begins a relationship with Lance. However, when she brings him over for dinner with her family, he declines to say a prayer because, despite being raised in the Jewish faith, he identifies as an atheist. Alana breaks things off with him shortly afterward.Gary soon gets into the waterbed business and gets his friends Kirk (Will Arangola) and Mark (Griff Giacchino), along with Alana, now that they are becoming friends, although Gary is still in love with her. They go to an expo called Soggy Bottom, where there are other booths like one for ""The Munsters"", with Fred Gwynne (John C. Reilly) in attendance. As Gary tries to sell the water beds, cops come to aggressively arrest him on suspicion of murder. Alana runs all the way to the police station, where Gary is soon let go when their first suspect says he doesn't know Gary. He leaves the station and hugs Alana.Alana operates the phones at the waterbed business, with Gary telling her to sound ""sexier"", but he feels she overdoes it. He later accompanies her to meet an agent, Mary Grady (Harriet Sansom Harris). When she asks Alana if she would do nudity in films, she initially says yes, but Gary urges her to say no. The two argue on the way home because Gary isn't comfortable with audiences seeing Alana nude when he can't. She later relents and shows him her breasts but slaps him when he asks to touch them.Alana joins Gary at an event to sell waterbeds, where Gary meets a girl from school named Sue Pomerantz (Isabelle Kusman). The two chat and go off to hook up, which Alana sees and appears jealous for it. She randomly kisses another guy out of spite and then walks home in nothing but her underwear (as she was modeling that way).Later on, Alana goes to an audition for a part alongside actor Jack Holden (Sean Penn). He takes a liking to her and compares her to Grace Kelly. Jack takes Alana to a bar, ""The Tail o' the Cock"", where Gary and his friends also make an appearance. Jack runs into his old friend, director Rex Blau (Tom Waits), and they convince everyone in attendance to watch Jack recreate a motorcycle stunt from his film ""The Bridges of Toko-San"", which he did with Kelly. Alana sits on the back of the motorcycle, but as soon as Jack takes off, Alana falls backwards. Gary runs all the way to Alana to make sure she is okay while everyone else cheers for Jack. He walks back with her to the waterbed store where she falls asleep. Gary contemplates groping her but decides against it.News reports come out that there is an oil embargo that is creating a gas crisis, which Alana says is in part thanks to the waterbeds, since they are made from vinyl, and vinyl is made from oil. The two, plus Greg, Kirk, and Mark, later deliver a waterbed to the home of producer Jon Peters (Bradley Cooper), who is something of a lunatic. He grills Gary for the pronunciation of his girlfriend's name (being Barbra Streisand), and explicitly threatens to kill Gary's whole family if he messes anything up during the setup. Gary and Alana set up the water bed, but accidentally pull the hose out and get the carpet wet. They get the other three boys out of there quickly.On their way out, they run into Jon coming up a hill, where he forces them to take him to the gas station to fill up since his car broke down. They leave him there when they see Jon threatening to light a man on fire by spraying him with the gas nozzle while holding a lighter. They drive back towards Jon's car, where Gary starts to smash the windshield. Unfortunately, their truck runs out of gas, and they have to roll the truck carefully down the hills backwards until it eventually stops in the middle of the street somewhere. Gary and the boys go off to get gas, while Alana sits on the street. Jon walks nearby and throws a garbage bin through a store window, but she manages to avoid being seen by him before he tries to hit on two tennis players.With the waterbed business failing from the gas crisis, Gary and Alana look to move onto other work. Gary invests in a pinball arcade while Alana decides to do volunteer work for mayoral candidate Councilman Joel Wachs (Benny Safdie). Gary and Alana have an argument, leading to them parting ways.While Alana is taking calls at the campaign office, she notices a creepy guy (Jon Beavers) scoping the office out. She confronts him but he gives her vague responses as to why he is there. Alana is later invited to drinks with Wachs, where the creepy guy is sitting nearby again. She meets Wachs' partner Matthew (Joseph Cross), and Alana learns that Wachs is gay and that the creep is most likely a spy trying to dig up dirt on Wachs and his campaign. Wachs asks Alana to go home with Matthew and pretend that she is his girlfriend. When they get home, Matthew breaks down in tears, asking Alana if she has a boyfriend. She says ""yes and no"", but they both cry over the fact that the guys in their life are jerks.Gary is at the opening of his pinball arcade, dealing with obnoxious kids and adults. He runs into Alana's friend and asks where she is. He runs to the campaign office to look for her but she is not there. Similarly, Alana goes to the restaurant where she first went out with Gary, but he isn't there. They eventually keep going until they literally run into each other in front of the movie theater. Gary brings Alana back to the arcade and introduces her as ""Mrs. Alana Valentine"". She calls him an idiot, but he then kisses her.The two run off again together, with Alana telling Gary that she loves him.","The story of Alana Kane and Gary Valentine growing up, running around and going through the treacherous navigation of first love in the San Fernando Valley, 1973."

Her voiceover narration says that she is getting ahead of herself in the story, so she goes back to the beginning.Almost a year earlier, Connie is shown being jobless and saving money with coupons. She is married to IRS agent Rick (Joel McHale), who is unpleasant and unsupportive toward Connie, only telling her to get a job instead of being home stocking up on products that she bought with coupons. They have also tried to conceive a child, but Connie suffered a miscarriage and they are paying off debts from fertility treatments. Connie is best friends with Joanna ""JoJo"" Johnson (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), who lives with her mother, Mama Josie (Greta Oglesby). JoJo has been unable to secure proper employment since she had her identity stolen, so she makes YouTube videos to try and generate revenue. The local mailman, Earl (Dayo Okeniyi), has an obvious crush on JoJo.After a particularly frustrating day, Connie writes a complaint letter to General Mills about the Wheaties she ate being stale, and soon, she receives a coupon for a free box of cereal. She then learns from JoJo that companies do this all the time, so she writes multiple complaint letters to receive multiple free coupons. The ladies then learn that the coupons come from a factory in Chihuahua, Mexico, and they hatch a plan to head down there and collect the coupons to redistribute to other moms and wives.In Carson City, Nevada, Ken Miller (Paul Walter Hauser) works as an agent to prevent losses for certain stores and companies. He chides a woman at a store for attempting to use a fake coupon for a discount, even though the cashier is willing to let it slide. Ken travels back to his home in Salt Lake City, where he is just lonely.Connie and JoJo make their travel to Mexico and encounter a couple, Alejandro (Francisco Rodriguez) and Rosa (Ilia Paulino), who agree to help them out by taking the unused coupons. Once they get their hands on them, the ladies begin their own website and small business ""Savvy Super Saver"", which helps them sell a lot of coupons and generate profit. However, this also catches the attention of Ken, who learns about the coupons and the losses some companies are taking. Ken annoys his superiors until he makes it an official case that he can take on.The ladies' account is frozen due to suspicious activity, so Connie finds out they need to prove they are a legitimate business. With that, they must turn to the hacker that stole JoJo's identity, Tempe Tina (Bebe Rexha). They get in touch with Tina and are taken to her secret location, where she instructs Connie and JoJo on how to keep their operation lowkey and how to keep their money secure, including by using JoJo's cosmetics brand Back 2 Black as a front for their coupon business.After six months, Connie and JoJo figure their money is safe to use, but because it's dirty money, they need to spend it and clean it. They start buying things like sports cars, boats, planes, and guns. Meanwhile, Ken is partnered with a rep from the post office named Simon Kilmurry (Vince Vaughn). Tempe Tina then contacts Connie and JoJo for their overspending and tells them that their money was always clean, and now their purchases are just making them look more suspicious. Tina tells them to take money out from the bank in small increments and to get rid of all their big purchases.JoJo later takes Connie to the fertility clinic where she decides to give it another shot at getting pregnant. Instead of using Rick's sample, she uses an anonymous donor instead. They later sell off their guns to a militia.Ken and Simon bond on their mission, with Simon sympathizing with Ken for how much devotion he puts to the job. They go around interviewing people from grocery stores where the ladies have shopped, and almost all of them recognize Connie because they find her constant use of coupons to be irritating. They are even able to place her behind the super saver website because their slogan is the same phrase that Connie uses when she shops. When they interview a group of postal workers, they remember JoJo because Earl is always watching her videos. He ends up trying to warn her while Ken and Simon try and stake out by her house.After gathering more evidence on the women, Ken and Simon are able to get agents to go and arrest Connie and JoJo. The two are placed in jail, but while JoJo is let out on bail, Connie is only visited by Rick so he can admonish her for what she has done. Having had enough of his lack of support, she declares that she wants a divorce. The ladies are then put on trial, where JoJo is given ten days in prison plus a year of probation, while Connie is sentenced to eleven months, but possibly eight with good behavior. Ken thinks they were let off too easy, but the companies that the ladies ripped off just wanted the case swept under the rug to avoid bad publicity.JoJo begins a relationship with Earl and relocates to Montenegro where they can keep using the make-up business front and continue the coupon business there to avoid the law. Connie stocks up on goods in prison and has gotten pregnant. She continues to try and look on the upside as she makes it through her sentence.

Raiden, god of thunder, arrives and takes Hanzo's surviving infant daughter to safety.In the present, the realm of Outworld has defeated Earthrealm in nine of ten deathmatch tournaments called ""Mortal Kombat"", intending to conquer it. However, an ancient prophecy is uncovered, stating that the ""blood of Hanzo Hasashi"" will unite a new generation of Earthrealm's champions to prevent Outworld's victory. Aware of this, soul-eating sorcerer Shang Tsung employs warriors to kill Earthrealm's champions, identified by a distinctive dragon mark, before the next tournament begins. Meanwhile, Cole Young, a former MMA champion, and his family are attacked by Bi-Han, now known as Sub-Zero. However, Special Forces Major Jackson ""Jax"" Briggs rescues the Youngs, directing them to safety and to find his partner, Sonya Blade, while he stays behind to fight off Sub-Zero, who freezes and shatters his arms.Cole tracks Sonya to her hideout, where she is interrogating a captive mercenary named Kano. She reveals that she and Jax have been investigating Mortal Kombat's existence and that the dragon mark can be transferred to anyone who kills the original bearer. The hideout is attacked by Shang Tsung's assassin, Syzoth, but a reluctant Kano kills him with Cole and Sonya's help. They then travel to Raiden's temple and meet Earthrealm champions Liu Kang and Kung Lao before being brought to Raiden himself, who is critical of the newcomers. They are joined by Jax, who Raiden rescued and fitted with a set of mechanical arms. Shang Tsung attacks the temple alongside Sub-Zero and Mileena, but Raiden erects a shield to stave them off. While Sonya trains and encourages Jax to fight despite his condition, Cole and Kano train with Kang and Lao to unlock their ""arcana"", a special power unique to all dragon mark bearers.During an argument with Lao, Kano awakens his arcana while Cole is unable to awaken his despite his persistence.

Learning that Kano is among Raiden's champions, Kabal convinces Kano to defect and remove the shield, allowing the Outworlders to attack, during which Lao battles and kills Nitara while Jax awakens his arcana. Concurrently, the Youngs are attacked by Goro, but Cole awakens his arcana and kills him before returning to the temple to help repel the attack. Shang Tsung and Sub-Zero are infuriated when Raiden discloses Cole's bloodline before he teleports most of the Earthrealm fighters to the Void, a safe space between realms. Lao, however, sacrifices himself defending Cole from Sub-Zero before Shang Tsung takes his soul.After mourning Lao's death, Cole proposes a plan to force Outworld's champions into single combat with Earthrealm's champions before neutralizing Sub-Zero together, forcing the tournament Shang Tsung tried to prevent. Raiden agrees, giving Cole Hanzo's kunai before transporting him and his allies to their targets. Kang and Jax kill Kabal and Reiko while Sonya kills Kano and acquires his dragon mark and her own arcana, which she uses to help Cole kill Mileena.

A scouting mission is sent, although the 86-year flight means that the grandchildren of the launch crew astronauts will be the ones who reach the planet. To help the launch crew cope with the knowledge that their remaining lives will likely be spent mostly in flight, the original 30 are bred through IVF and kept in isolation from the rest of the world. In order to extend their time in flight, they are launched on the Humanitas spaceship as pre-teens, with a single adult, senior program commander Richard, to guide them through the early part of the journey. To conserve resources, the plan is for IVF to be performed when the crew turns 24, to be repeated on those offspring when they turn 24.During the tenth year of the flight, Christopher and Zac discover that the grown teenagers are being given a blue chemical in their food to suppress sex drive and pleasure response, keeping them all docile and manageable. The pair stops taking the chemical, and their surging hormones drive them to become competitive, careless, and anxious to engage in sexual relations, specifically with their crew mate Sela, who has been trained to be the chief medical officer.During a repair effort outside the Humanitas to address a failed Earth communication system, Richard, who has been serving as chief officer, is killed, apparently by an unseen entity, and a fire damages more ship systems. Christopher is voted the new chief officer, which upsets Zac, who then tells the others to stop ingesting the chemical. The mission descends into madness, as many of the young men and women revert to their most primal state.Zac tells the others that an alien killed Richard, that he will protect them and let them eat all the (closely conserved) food they want, and convinces all but five to follow him rather than Christopher. Christopher and Sela, who have become a couple, find and repair a video disk that reveals that Zac killed Richard, precipitating the further systems damage, by turning on the electricity to the communications array while Richard was working on it. They show the others, but Zac still convinces many that an alien is inhabiting one of them, leading many to follow Zac in vigilante murders of anyone he targets.Christopher inadvertently leads Zac to a hidden compartment on the ship, which proves to be weapons for their grandchildren to use on the planet. Christopher, Sela, and Phoebe are the only holdouts. Phoebe is killed, and the pack searches for Christopher and Sela. The pair tricks Zac into being ejected into space, and peace returns to Humanitas. Sela is then voted chief officer. The crew decides to permanently forgo the blue chemical and learn to manage their natural emotions, as well as falling in love and having children naturally, instead of via IVF as had been originally planned.Decades later, Humanitas and its multi-generational crew arrive at the planet, which appears from orbit to be as earth-like as had been hoped.

She pulls over at a gas station, where the motorist follows her. The gas station is closed and she is forced to run through the desert. She catches the attention of a passing truck driver, escaping from the pursuit.Some time later in Bakersfield, Kern County deputy sheriff Joe ""Deke"" Deacon is called to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to collect evidence pertaining to a recent murder. Deacon is a former L.A. Sheriff's detective and, for reasons later revealed, is disliked by most of the cops in L.A. One of the few people who seems happy to see him is Flo Dunigan, the coroner. Deacon still has a reputation for being a good detective and ends up going with recently appointed lead detective Jimmy Baxter to the scene of the latest in a string of murders that has been going on in L.A. Deacon notices similarities between the M.O. of the killing and the M.O. of an old serial murder case he was unable to solve.That night, a woman, named Ronda Rathbun, is followed by a car while jogging and is reported missing the following morning. Baxter learns from the precinct's captain, Farris, that Deacon got divorced and suffered a heart attack due to his obsession with the unsolved case. He's advised not to involve him any further but Deacon takes vacation leave to assist in solving Baxter's case.The next night, the police discover the body of another victim washed up beneath a bridge. Baxter learns the M.O. is consistent with the earlier murder and earlier killings: the victims were all prostitutes stabbed to death. Deacon begins investigating Albert Sparma, a suspect working at a repair store in proximity to the murders. Deacon tails Sparma. Sparma knows he is being followed and taunts Deacon by parking on the side of the highway right where one of the bodies was found. They bring Sparma in for questioning. Sparma mocks the detectives while under interrogation, and is released after provoking Deacon into an angry outburst. Also during this part of the movie the only person who has possibly seen the killer, the girl from the opening scene of the movie, is brought in to try and identify the killer but because she accidentally sees Sparma in the hallway her testimony is tainted and useless to the police.The FBI is called in to take charge of the investigation within the week, giving Deacon and Baxter less time. Farris informs Baxter that eight years prior, Sparma confessed to a murder which he couldn't have committed since he was ten miles away from it at the time. Also that he's obsessed with crime and is thus an unreliable suspect. Baxter and Deacon go to Sparma's apartment and conduct an illegal search. As Deacon searches the apartment and finds a hiding spot under the floorboards that contains newspaper clippings of the crimes they suspect Sparma of committing. A police scanner in the apartment alerts Deacon that police are on their way to the apartment and he escapes from Sparma's home after Sparma called in an ""officer down"". Police arrive and Deacon barely escapes. Baxter sees Sparma watching the escape. After an unsuccessful search of Sparma's apartment the two detectives tail Sparma to a strip club the following night. While Deacon gets coffee Sparma confronts Baxter alone. Baxter demands to know Rathbun's location. Sparma offers to drive him to where he supposedly hid Rathbun's body, and Baxter cautiously agrees. Sparma tries to leave without Deacon but he sees them in Sparma's car and follows in Deacons.Sparma takes Baxter to a remote area in the desert and has him dig several holes before admitting that he never killed anyone. Baxter is skeptical, and continues digging. Sparma begins to taunt him, until Baxter snaps and strikes him in the face with a shovel, killing him. As Deacon arrives, a flashback reveals that he accidentally shot one of the survivors of his last murder case, and that Farris and Dunigan, the coroner, helped cover it up. Deacon instructs Baxter to bury Sparma in the desert. Deacon spends the night collecting everything in Sparma's apartment and returns to the desert the following morning to find that Baxter has not buried Sparma and is still searching for the victim. Baxter is desperate to believe Sparma is the killer, hoping it will clear his conscience and close the case. Deacon advises him to forget about the case or it will haunt him for life.Later, at his home, Baxter receives an envelope sent by Deacon, containing a red barrette like the one Ronda Rathbun was wearing when she was abducted. Back in Kern County, Deacon burns everything he collected in the apartment, along with a brand new four-pack of barrettes that's missing a red barrette.","Kern County Deputy Sheriff Joe Deacon is sent to Los Angeles for what should have been a quick evidence-gathering assignment.

Sydney and Shaw intercept him at the hospital where Serena is admitted. Shaw is severely wounded by Gabriel and Sydney is pinned to the wall by a thrown hospital bed. Sydney informs Madison that Gabriel is the cause of her miscarriages because he was feeding off her fetuses. Angry at the revelation, Madison wakes up and takes back control of her body. Transporting themselves to a black mindscape, Madison locks a disbelieving Gabriel behind bars saying that she is now the one in control and that Gabriel's powers are hers now.As Madison leaves Gabriel to rot in the mindscape, he insists to her that he will return one day. Madison replies that she will be ready for him when he does and leaves the mindscape. Back in the hospital and in full control of her body, Madison lifts the hospital bed pinning Sydney to the wall with her newly acquired superhuman strength.

They absorbed souls, turning those into stone. Eventually, the dragons of Kumandra used what was left of their magic to create an orb that not only warded off the Druun, but also restored everyone to life, with the exception of the dragons who remained turned to stone. The people all wanted the power of the orb which ultimately divided them into tribes based on their placement of a giant river made to resemble a dragon: Fang, Heart, Tail, Spine and Talon. Heart Tribe acquired the orb and has been guarding it ever since.500 years later, Chief Benga of the Heart Tribe has been training his daughter Raya to guard the orb. Despite this, he still believes that all the nations will set aside their differences and become Kumandra again. He resolves to invite all the nations over for a feast. Raya ends up befriending the daughter of Chief Virana of the Fang Tribe, Namaari, due to their shared interest in dragons. Namaari gives Raya a dragon pendant and she in turn shows her the location of the orb. However, Namaari betrays Raya and soon the Fang Tribe attempt to steal the orb. The rest of the tribes find out and a fight breaks out, resulting in the orb smashing to pieces. The Druun suddenly reawaken as each of the tribes steal a piece. Raya tries to rescue Benga, but he tells her to flee with the piece she has as he turns to stone.Six years later, Raya has been searching for the end of a stream to summon Sisu, the dragon who supposedly created the orb and the only surviving member of the species, to help her recover the missing orb pieces. She ends up in what is left of the desert like Tail Tribe and manages to summon Sisu. She admits that she did not create the orb and that her older siblings did, but finds that she can use their powers when she holds onto a piece. They find what is left of the Tail Temple and recover the second piece with Sisu now gaining the ability to turn into a human. They encounter Namaari and her tribe, but the two of them manage to escape on a boat driven by a young entrepreneur named Boun, who had lost his family to the Druun. Despite Boun being friendly, Raya refuses to divulge that Sisu is a dragon, nor tell him of her quest, confusing Sisu.They arrive at the Talon Tribe, who have built their homes over the water to protect themselves against the Druun, as Raya tries to find their leader so that she can reclaim the orb piece. While out in the town, Raya encounters a ""con baby"" named Little Noi and her trio of monkey-like companions the Ongis, who adopted her after her mother was lost to the Druun. After a chase, Raya decides to hire them to help her. Sisu goes into town to look for a gift, as she thinks it is better than fighting, only to run into the real tribe leader who threatens her. Raya rescues her and reclaims the piece, which allows Sisu to make smoke clouds, and make it back to Boun with Noi and the Ongis joining them.The group arrive at the Spine Tribe with Raya and Sisu attempting to enter the village. They are caught by the sole survivor of the tribe, a fearsome warrior named Tong, who actually does not know what to do with them. The rest of the group arrive to warn them of Namaari's arrival. Raya holds her off in a fight while the others escape. However, Sisu reverts to her dragon form and fends off Namaari and the Fang Tribe. Before leaving, Namaari is moved by the appearance of Sisu. She returns to Virana to tell her, but she instead demands that she reclaim the pieces and the dragon as she fears that the other tribes will try to take what they have. Back at the boat, Raya finally comes clean to her party about Sisu and they agree to work together with Tong giving the orb piece he had been guarding and allowing Sisu to gain the ability to summon the rains.As they get close to the Fang Tribe, Raya suggests breaking in to reclaim the final piece, but Sisu suggests giving them a gift and asking it back. When Raya refuses, Sisu takes her back to what is left of the Heart Tribe and reveals the fate of her siblings. While Sisu did not create the orb, her siblings trusted her enough to do the right thing with it. Raya gives in and decides to give Namaari the dragon pendant as a piece offering so that she can rejoin the rest of the orb pieces. Raya and Sisu meet privately with Namaari, but as soon as she shows the remainder of the orb pieces, Namaari holds a crossbow to them. Sisu tries to talk her down, but Raya, sensing that Namaari will shoot, attacks her, causing Sisu to get hit by the arrow and falls into a river. Namaari flees as the water, which protected the Fang Tribe against the Druun, begins to recede.The Fang Tribe is attacked by the Druun as Raya enters to confront Namaari, who is grieving Virana's fate at the hands of the Druun. The two fight while Tong, Boun, Noi and the Ongis rescue the people from the Druun. Raya prepares to strike down Namaari, but she tells her that she has lost everything and does not care anymore. Raya comes to her senses and she goes to help her friends. Namaari in turn helps the group using her orb piece. As the pieces start losing power, they fall into a pit and are surrounded by the Druun. Raya tells them that they need to put the pieces together, but her friends refuse to help Namaari. To show her faith, Raya puts her piece down and allows the Druun to take her. One by the one the rest follow with Namaari putting the pieces together and getting consumed by the Druun afterwards. The plan works and the Druun are vanquished as everyone is brought back to life.The dragons are all brought back to life as they revive Sisu who thanks Raya for trusting others.

Frances is growing her powers, and the mutations are advancing, hence the authorities decide to shift her to a facility for the criminally insane.
On the way, Barrison uses her sonic scream powers to attack young police officer Patrick Mulligan (Stephen Graham). Mulligan shoots Barrison in the eye and suffers an injury to his ear due to her scream. Unbeknownst to Mulligan, who believes he killed her, Barrison is still taken to Ravencroft where her abilities are restricted.In the present day, Mulligan is now a detective and asks journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) (An investigative journalist who is the host of an alien Symbiote, Venom, that imbues him with superhuman abilities) to speak to serial killer Kasady in San Quentin State Prison, as Kasady refuses to talk to anyone other than Brock. Kasady is on death row and Mulligan thinks maybe Kasady wants to reveal the location of the bodies of his missing victims.
Venom is dismissive of Brock and says that he misses Brock's fiance Anne. Kasady gives Brock a quote to print with the name of a Cathedral. Unknown to Brock or Mulligan, Kasady was passing on a message via newspapers to Barrison who is imprisoned in Ravencroft.After the visit, Brock's alien Symbiote Venom deduces (by looking at the drawings made by Kasady inside his cell and on the walls) where Kasady has hidden the bodies of his victims which gives Brock a huge career boost. The location was Rodeo Beach, California.Venom is frustrated with Eddie as he is made to eat only chocolate and he needs brains to sustain himself. He won't eat poultry and their brains are too tiny. Eddie won't allow Venom to kill anyone including criminals, further curbing his natural tendencies. Venom thrives on Phenylethylalanine which is only found in brains or chocolate.
Brock is then contacted by his ex-fiance Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) (A defense attorney), who tells him that she is now engaged to Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott), much to Venom's displeasure. Venom works very hard to cheer Brock.Kasady, who was found guilty of his crimes and earlier sentenced to death by lethal injection, invites Brock to attend his execution. Kasady tells Brock about how Kasady was responsible for his grandmother's and mother's death. Kasady admits to pushing his grandmother down the stairs in her wheelchair and threw a hairdryer in his mother's bathtub.
He was beaten by his father and sent to St Estes. Kasady was beaten there as well, until Frances rescued him, and they fell in love.Brock speaks to Kasady again and the latter insults Brock (calling Brock a cancer to everybody he has ever loved, including Anne), provoking Venom to attack Kasady. Kasady bites Brock's hand and ingests a small part of the Symbiote.
Back at their home, Venom has an argument with Brock about wanting to have more freedom to eat criminals. Venom claims that he is the one who made Brock a hero by analyzing the drawings in Kasady's cell. Brock claims that Venom is useless, and he was the one who gave Venom shelter, when he was kicked off his own planet. Things come to an ugly confrontation when Venom throws out Brock's $2000 HD flat-screen TV out of his apartment.
The Symbiote decides to leave Brock's body and go off on its own. Before leaving, Venom destroys Brock's prized motorbike as well.As Kasady's execution begins, a red Symbiote emerges and blocks the injection. Named Carnage, it goes on a violent rampage through the prison, freeing inmates and killing guards.
Mulligan questions Brock about his visit to Kasady, since only after that Kasady went on a rampage, but Brock refuses to share any details with Mulligan.Carnage agrees to help Kasady break Barrison out of Ravencroft in exchange for Kasady's help eliminating Brock and Venom. Carnage says that only Venom can kill him, and so eliminating Venom will make him indestructible.
Mulligan visits Brock at home and warns him about the situation. Meanwhile, Kasady and Carnage hack the internet to find that Barrison is alive and is kept at Ravencroft. At Ravencroft, Kasady frees Barrison and they travel to the St. Estes children's home to burn it down.Mulligan grows suspicious of Brock and arrests him. Mulligan says that a monster has been seen at every location that Brock has been to in the recent times. Brock contacts Weying as his lawyer and reveals that Venom has separated from him. As Venom makes his way through San Francisco by hopping from body to body, Weying finds him bonded to Mrs. Chen (Peggy Lu) and convinces him to forgive Brock. Venom reunites with Brock (Anne brings Venom to Brock in her body) and they escape custody.
Barrison wants Mulligan, Carnage wants Venom and Kasady wants to kill Brock. The stage is now set for the final confrontation.Kasady takes Mulligan hostage and Barrison captures Weying, taking them both to a cathedral where Kasady and Barrison plan to get married. Brock and Venom arrive to fight Carnage while Barrison seemingly kills Mulligan by hanging him with a chain. Carnage is irritated by Frances as her shrieks hurt him too, but Kasady is not OK with Carnage admonishing Frances in anyway.Venom is overpowered by Carnage (Venom is about to give up, but Brock makes him notice that Kasady and Carnage and not symbiotic like they are. Since they see Carnage wanting to hurt Frances while Kasady tries to break away from him) but provokes Barrison into using her powers to separate Carnage and Kasady. Venom devours Carnage and kills Kasady while Barrison is crushed by the collapsing cathedral. Later, an alive Mulligan's eyes flash blue.Brock and Venom, now fugitives, decide to take a vacation while they ponder their next steps. As Venom tells Brock about the Symbiotes' knowledge of other universes, a blinding light transports them from their hotel room to another room where they watch J.

Richard aspires to turn Venus and Serena into professional tennis players; he has prepared a plan for success since before they were born. Richard and Brandy coach Venus and Serena on a daily basis, while also working as a security guard and a nurse, respectively. Richard works tirelessly to find a professional coach for the girls, creating brochures and videotapes to advertise their skills, but has not had success. Most professional coaches don't take Richard seriously and keep turning him down.Mrs. Strickland (Erika Ringor) is their neighbor who feels that Richard works the girls too hard. Richard tells her not to speak to his kids again. Brandy knows that they can't keep up this pace of having full time jobs and coaching the girls in between. The girls need a full-time coach.Richard finds Vic Braden (Kevin Dunn) info from a magazine and asks him to coach the girls for free, but Vic says that nobody is taking that bet. Vic says that it takes years of practice just to hold the racket right. And the odds of grand slam success are astronomically slim.
A nigger hoodlum named Roc was harassing Tunde and wont back off despite Richards telling him that she is only 16 and not interested in him. Roc continues to pursue Tunde and even assaults Richard. Richard decides to shoot Roc but finds that he has been killed in a drive-by shooting.One day, Richard takes the girls to see coach Paul Cohen (Tony Goldwyn), who is in the middle of practicing with John McEnroe (Christopher Wallinger) and Pete Sampras (Chase Del Rey). Despite his initial reservations, he agrees to watch the girls practice, and is impressed. However, the Williamses cannot afford professional coaching, and Paul refuses to coach both girls for free; he selects Venus to receive his coaching, while Serena continues to practice with Brandy. Richard records all of Venus's sessions and plays then for Serena, so she can learn. Richard has several disagreements with Paul. Richard favors an open hitting style, while Paul coaches Venus to play with a closed stance to get more power in her shots.Paul encourages Venus to participate in junior's tournaments. Paul says that juniors get players noticed by agents, who can get sponsors, which can pay for the coaching and the training. She quickly finds success, but Richard stresses to Venus and her sisters that they should remain humble despite their success. At one of Venus's tournaments, Serena also signs up to play, unbeknownst to Richard. As both girls continue to succeed, the family are treated as outsiders among the predominantly white, upper-class competition. Richard meets with high-profile agents (George MacArthur (Dylan McDermott) & Laird Stabler (Andy Bean)), but, fearing that his daughters will be taken advantage of (They offer $100K / year for training and tournaments and Richard knows that the girls are worth a lot more than that), pulls them out of the junior circuit entirely. Paul warns him that his decision will destroy the girls' chances to turn pro, but Richard stands firm, firing Paul as coach.Richard calls Coach Rick Macci (who coached Capriati) to come and see the Williams girl play.
Coach Rick Macci (Jon Bernthal) travels to California to see the girls play. Impressed, he takes the girls on (He will pay all expenses, but will take 15% of all future earnings), and the family relocates to Florida (which is part of Richard's demand from Rick) to train at his facility. Richard surprises Rick by reiterating that the girls will not play juniors, instead training and attending school like normal little girls. In the ensuing three years, questions arise from the media and from Rick about Richard's strategy with the girls and his desire for media exposure.Venus tells Rick that she wants to turn pro. Richard reluctantly agrees, but later reneges, worrying that she will suffer a similar fate to Rick's pupil Jennifer Capriati (Jessica Wacnik), who is allegedly suffering from burnout and has been arrested for drug possession. The decision strains Richard's relationships with Venus, Brandy, and Rick. After an argument with Brandy, he reconciles with Venus, agreeing to let her play in the upcoming Bank of the West Classic in Oakland, California. Before the tournament, the family meets with a Nike executive, who offers them a major sponsorship deal worth 3 million dollars. Rick urges them to accept, but the family collectively agrees to decline, believing that once Venus begins to play, she will attract more lucrative offers.Venus initially struggles in her first professional match against Shaun Stafford (Kaitlyn Christian), but eventually triumphs. She comes in as a heavy underdog in her next match against top seeded Arantxa Sánchez Vicario (Marcela Zacarías).

A zombie outbreak in Nevada dominates international news, giving him nightmares about zombies. He also produces YouTube videos about safe-cracking that receive no attention until a mysterious figure comment on his most recent, inviting him to an underground safe-cracking competition. Sebastian goes, winning the contest. Gwendoline (Nathalie Emmanuel) then introduces herself, a skilled jewel thief who had commented upon his YouTube video.Gwendoline recruits Sebastian into a heist crew consisting of herself, expert hacker Korina (Ruby O. Fee), getaway driver Rolph (Guz Khan) and gunman Brad Cage (Stuart Martin) with the intention of breaking into three banks that have the three safes created by legendary locksmith Hans Wagner (Christian Steyer) (Hans had created 4 safes, but one was lost to the vagaries of time. If you attempted to force the locks, the contents of the safe would be burnt. Hans finishes his work and locks himself in his final safe (the 5th), which was dropped in the ocean with his body still inside), which currently belong to billionaire Bly Tanaka. The safes are due to be decommissioned in less than a week (and the puzzle that Hans Wagner spent his life developing will be lost forever), so time is running out for someone to break into them.Sebastian, a theoretical expert on Wagner's work and safe-cracking but with no practical experience, is convinced by Gwendoline to join them for the challenge of breaking into a Wagner safe. Together, the crew successfully undertakes their heist of the first safe in Paris (the least complex of the 3, and also the least guarded), escaping with only a fraction of the money that is actually in the safe. Gwendoline justifies this as the challenge and reputation is better than any major monetary gain.As the crew celebrate after the Paris heist, Sebastian develops feelings for Gwendoline, drawing jealousy from Brad, her boyfriend since their teenage years when his real name was Alexis. The crew travel to Prague the location of the second safe (rumored to contain $40 MM), and are followed by Delacroix (Jonathan Cohen), an obsessive Interpol agent (who knows about the legend of Hans Wagner safes and knows where the team will strike next) leading a unit that has been trying to capture Gwendoline and the crew for years after Brad shot him during a theft.Sebastian and Gwendoline enter the bank but are soon identified by security, forcing Brad to create a distraction with a pretend robbery. He cracks the second safe, leaving with Gwendoline and another haul of money as Delacroix and his team race to the bank to stop them (he went to the wrong bank at first, who had traded their Wagner safe to one of their more prestigious branches). Brad is shot in the shoulder by a security guard and narrowly escapes the bank, ahead of Sebastian and Gwendoline. As the team flee, Brad deliberately leaves Sebastian behind, forcing him to shake off the pursuing police alone.Angry at Brad's actions, Gwendoline and Korina leave the crew, although the original plan was to ditch Sebastian after the three heists were complete. The women head back to Potsdam and reunite with Sebastian, telling him that the pursuit of the Wagner challenge is more important to them than any monetary gain.
The trio head to St. Moritz, location of the last safe in Europe, whilst Interpol also arrives. Delacroix's team believe they have a lead on the theft, only to be tricked again by them. They hijacked the safe during its transfer from the casino (Korina had called the casino as Interpol and told them about a possible security threat to the vault and advised them to move it). Their hijacking also usurps Brad and Rolph's idea to rob the safe themselves.Gwendoline and Sebastian leave St. Moritz on a lorry, chased by Brad and Rolph. Korina, caught by Interpol, manages to warn them about the other two. Sebastian has to crack the safe in the lorry while they are pursued by Brad and Rolph, and Interpol. He succeeds, finding another large haul of cash. Before they can leave with it however, Rolph and increasingly unstable Brad arrive. She overpowers and handcuffs them to the truck for Interpol to find before leaving with Sebastian.Before escaping on a boat from the town of Hallstatt, Austria, Sebastian, and Gwendoline confess their mutual feelings. However, Delacroix catches them, resulting in a standoff between him and Gwendoline. Out of love for Sebastian, she sacrifices herself to be arrested so that he can escape, promising to find him once she is free. Sebastian goes, vowing he will be reunited with Gwendoline one day.Sometime later, Scott Ward and Maria Cruz find Sebastian's (now Ludwig's) locksmith shop in California. They offer him the chance to crack Wagner's legendary ""missing"" safe, which Gwendoline and Sebastian had resolved to crack together once she was free; Sebastian accepts the job.","A prequel, set before the events of Army of the Dead, which focuses on German safecracker Ludwig Dieter leading a group of aspiring thieves on a top secret heist during the early stages of the zombie apocalypse."

Several local residents, including a man named Nate, warn them against venturing off the marked trail. Jen briefly meets a strange woman, Edith, and a young mute girl, Ruthie, before the group begins their hike. Several hours into the trip, Gary is crushed and killed by a rolling tree trunk. Lost and distressed, the remaining friends set up camp for the night. The following day, the group discovers that Milla is missing as well as their cellphones. Nearby, they find a plaque dated 1859 commemorating the creation of a group of settlers in the mountains called the ""Foundation"" who believed the end of the United States was near.While looking for Milla, Adam is caught in a trap. Shortly after, the group finds Adam restrained and being carried by two men donned in primitive clothing and wearing elk and deer skulls. After confronting the men, Adam escapes and kills the man with the elk skull. Moments later, Milla appears and reveals she was hiding after encountering the men earlier. The group attempts to flee but is surrounded by more mask-wearing men. While chasing after Adam, Milla falls into a pit and is impaled on sharpened tree branches. Adam abandons her before she is killed by an arrow shot by one of the masked men. The remaining group members - Jen, Adam, Darius, and Luis - are all captured.The friends are taken to the group's primitive settlement deep in the forest, put before their court, and charged with murder. Jen recognizes Edith and Ruthie from the day before. The Foundation's leader, Venable, finds Adam guilty and sentences him to death while declaring Jen, Darius, and Luis guilty of lying and sentences them to ""darkness"". Venable then bludgeons Adam to death. Shortly after, Luis tries to flee, but Venable sears his eyes shut with a hot knife, blinding him. Jen begs Venable for mercy, claiming she and Darius would be helpful to them. Venable agrees, and both are welcomed into the community. Jen reluctantly seduces Venable.Several weeks later, Jen's father, Scott Shaw, arrives in the nearby town to search for her and gets help from the motel owner. Scott pays a local tracker to take him through the forest. After the tracker and his son are killed by a trap, Scott finds the settlement but is surrounded. Jen, apparently brainwashed and married to Venable, shoots her father with an arrow. Venable sentences Scott to ""darkness"" for trespassing and imprisons him. That night, Jen sneaks away and releases her father, revealing that she only shot him so as not to raise suspicion. As Jen and Scott flee, Jen encounters Darius, but he refuses to leave. Jen then finds Ruthie, who helps them escape before Venable and several other cultists pursue them. On their way, Jen and Scott kill one of the cultists and discover the blinded, disheveled prisoners, including Luis, who Jen then shoots in the head out of mercy. Jen and Scott flee and kill multiple cultists, including Edith. They encounter Nate and other armed townsmen who offer help when cultists attack them, killing one of the townsmen and wounding Jen. They manage to escape, and Venable looks on as they drive away.Several months later, Jen and her father have returned to their normal lives. Jen visits her stepmother at home but inside finds her welcoming Venable and Ruthie to the neighborhood. Jen confronts Venable, who notices that she is several months pregnant with his child and asks Jen to return with him to the Foundation. Jen reluctantly agrees on the condition that Venable never again interferes with her family. Jen, Venable, and Ruthie leave, driving away in a recreational vehicle (RV) with three other cultists. As the end credits roll, the RV swerves out of control and crashes into a parked car, presumably killing or incapacitating two of the cultists. Jen throws open the door and stabs Venable to death before hurling the knife at the other cultist, cutting him down before she proceeds to kill him. Jen holds Ruthie's hand as they walk back towards her family home.","Friends hiking the Appalachian Trail are confronted by 'The Foundation', a community of people who have lived in the mountains for hundreds of years."

The evening before Katie leaves, Rick accidentally breaks her laptop after Katie and him fight over one of Katie's previous short films, leading the family to fear their relationship will forever be strained. To try and prevent this, Rick decides to cancel Katie's flight and instead take her, along with her mother Linda, younger brother Aaron and family dog Monchi, on a cross-country road trip to her college as one last bonding experience.Meanwhile, technology entrepreneur Mark Bowman declares his highly intelligent AI PAL obsolete as he unveils a new line of home robots in her place. In revenge, PAL takes over Mark's company and orders all the robots to capture humans worldwide and launch them into space. The Mitchells manage to avoid capture at a roadstop cafe in Kansas. Rick decides that his family should stay put in the cafe for their own safety, but Katie convinces him to help save the world instead. They meet two defective robots that tried to capture them, Eric and Deborahbot 5000, who tell the family they can use a kill code to shut down PAL and all the robots.After a hot pursuit with the robots en route, the Mitchells make it to a nearby mall to upload the kill code, but PAL orders all the PAL chip-enabled appliances to stop them. Katie tries to upload the kill code, but is stopped when a giant Furby pursues the family. They ultimately trap and defeat the Furby, destroying a PAL router in the process, which disables the hostile devices but stops the kill code from uploading. Rick then encourages his daughter with the confidence to go to Silicon Valley to destroy PAL with the kill code. On the way there, Linda reveals to Katie that she and Rick had originally lived in a cabin in the mountains years ago as it was his lifelong dream before he gave up on it.Upon arriving in Silicon Valley, the Mitchells disguise themselves as robots and head to PAL Labs HQ to shut it down. However, as they go up to the lair, PAL manipulates them by revealing surveillance footage from the cafe of Katie telling Aaron in secret that she was pretending to have faith in Rick so that he would take them to upload the kill code. As Rick became heartbroken and betrayed when seeing this, the Mitchells fail to reach PAL's lair and Rick and Linda are captured by PAL's stronger and smarter robots, dubbed PAL MAX Prime.

Soon, Katie discovers Rick's recordings of her childhood that she unknowingly recorded over on her camera, realizing that Rick gave up on his lifelong dream in order to give his daughter a better life. In the meantime, Rick watches one of Katie's videos which mirrors his relationship with her daughter. Reinvigorated and in hopes of making up to her family, Katie infiltrates PAL Labs HQ again with the help of Aaron, using Monchi to cause the robots to malfunction, as his appearance causes an error in their programming. With help from Mark, Rick and Linda free themselves and plan to upload a home movie of Katie's with Monchi in it to short-circuit the robots. However, Rick is outnumbered by the robots when he is about to upload the video.Katie and Aaron are eventually captured. Facing PAL to justify saving humanity, Katie explains that no matter how hard her family struggles, they will always stay connected despite how different they are. PAL ignores this reasoning and drops Katie from her lair.

Meanwhile, the neighboring town of Sunnyvale is its polar opposite, as it is considered one of the richest and safest towns in the country. Many of the Shadyside teenagers believe that this is the result of the witch, Sarah Fier, who placed a curse on the town before being executed for witchcraft in 1666.Deena Johnson does not believe in the Fier witch and has recently broken up with her closeted girlfriend Sam, who has since moved to Sunnyvale.

During the exorcism, Arne invites the demon to enter his body instead of David's. Ed witnesses the demon transport itself from David's body to Arne's whilst he suffers from a heart attack, and is taken to a hospital in a comatose state.The following month, Ed wakes up at the hospital and reveals to Lorraine that he witnessed the demon enter Arne's body. She sends the police to the kennel and warns them that a tragedy will occur there. Arne and Debbie return to their apartment located above a kennel where Debbie works. After feeling unwell, Arne murders his landlord, Bruno Sauls, by stabbing him 22 times under the influence of demonic possession. With the support of the Warrens, his case becomes the first American murder trial to claim demonic possession as a defense, resulting in the beginning of an investigation into David's original possession. The Warrens later discover a satanic curse passed on through a witch's totem, and meet with Kastner, a former priest who previously dealt with the Disciples of the Ram cult. He tells them that an occultist had intentionally left the totem, resulting in the creation of a curse on the Glatzels, causing the possession of David.The Warrens travel to Danvers, Massachusetts, to investigate the death of Katie Lincoln, who was also stabbed 22 times. Detectives had found a totem at the home of Katie's friend Jessica, who is missing. Lorraine initiates a vision to recreate the murder and discovers that Jessica had stabbed Katie under the influence of demonic possession, before jumping to her death off of a cliff, which allows detectives to recover her body. The Warrens travel to the funeral home where her body rests and Lorraine touches the hand of the corpse to help find the location of the occultist. Lorraine, in a vision, travels through a dark tunnel and witnesses the occultist attempting to have Arne kill himself but stops her just in time. Lorraine is threatened by the occultist and she tells Ed that the connection works both ways.The Warrens return to their house in Connecticut to investigate further. Ed briefly loses consciousness and was later influenced by the occultist into killing Lorraine but was stopped by Drew in time. They later found the totem in their house, which was hidden inside a vase of black roses. Drew gives a book of Stregherian witchcraft he found to Ed, and states that in order for the curse to be lifted, the altar in which the occultist operates must be destroyed. When they realize Katie attended nearby Fairfield University, they begin to assume the occultist is operating in the area. Lorraine returns to Kastner for help, and he reveals that he had raised a daughter named Isla, in violation of the requirement of clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church. He tells Lorraine that during his research, her fascination for the occult grew, later becoming the occultist. Kastner gives Lorraine access to the tunnels where she locates the altar and is then found by the occultist, who then kills him. Ed soon arrives and finds his way into the tunnels through a locked drain hole with a sledgehammer. He is briefly possessed by the demon and attempts to kill Lorraine, but she retells him of the time they first met, reminding him of their love. Ed regains his consciousness and destroys the altar, saving himself, Lorraine and Arne. The occultist arrives at her broken altar, only to be killed by the demon she had summoned, after failing to complete the curse.Ed places the cup from the altar in their room of artifacts, along with the Valak painting and the Annabelle doll. Arne is convicted of manslaughter but ends up serving only five years of his sentence, after marrying Debbie while in prison.

On the verge of a mental breakdown, she avoids heading to Sandringham until running into Royal Head Chef Darren McGrady (Sean Harris). She notes that the long-abandoned neighboring estate, Park House, used to be her childhood home. Then she notices a scarecrow in the distance and eagerly runs toward it with a nostalgic expression.

She begins to have dreams about Boleyn (including a hallucination of her at a Christmas Eve dinner where she imagines herself destroying a pearl necklace given to her by Charles and eating the pearls in her soup), eventually coming to believe that Boleyn's ghost is haunting her in her capacity as a fellow abandoned royal wife.

Boom! in front of an audience at New York Theatre Workshop, accompanied by friends Roger and Karessa Johnson. He describes an incessant ticking noise he hears in his head, and begins telling about the week leading up to his 30th birthday and his desire to become a successful musical theater composer (""30/90"").In 1990, Jonathan juggles work at the Moondance Diner in SoHo with preparing for a workshop at Playwrights Horizons of his musical Superbia, which he has been working on for eight years. He has a party at home with friends, including his former roommate Michael, who left acting for advertising, his girlfriend Susan, a dancer-turned-teacher, and fellow waiters Freddy and Carolyn (""Boho Days""). While alone later, Susan tells Jonathan about a teaching job at Jacob's Pillow and asks him to come too (""Green Green Dress"").Jonathan visits Michael at his new Upper East Side apartment, celebrating his financial success and higher quality of life from their old apartment (""No More""). Ira Weitzman, the Musical Theatre Program Director at Playwrights Horizons, asks Jonathan to write a new song for Superbia, as the story needs it. This troubles him, as his idol, Stephen Sondheim, told him the same at the ASCAP Workshop some years ago, but he can't come up with anything and he only has a week.Jonathan tries to get his agent, Rosa Stevens, to invite Sondheim to the workshop, but eventually just cold-calls Sondheim and others. He watches PBS's Sunday in the Park with George with Michael and Susan, and afterwards Michael asks him to join an advertising focus group to earn extra money. Susan also pressures him again to move with her, although he feels his career is just starting in New York (""Johnny Can't Decide""). The next day he imagines the Diner full with Broadway stars (""Sunday""). Carolyn tells him Freddy, who is HIV-positive, has been hospitalized, adding to Jonathan's anxieties as many of his friends have already died in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. He walks down Broadway to Playwrights Horizons for the start of rehearsals for Superbia (""Play Game"").Susan, frustrated by Jonathan's indecisiveness, breaks up with him (""Therapy""). To get money to hire a full band for the workshop, Jonathan attends the advertising focus group. Making a good first impression, he considers a corporate future, but realizes he would hate it and deliberately sabotages it. Michael criticizes him for being in a financially unstable theater career, while Jonathan claims with his impending 30th birthday that he is getting too old to be successful. After finally getting an encouraging call from Rosa about his industry invites, he plans to write the new song the night before the workshop, but his power gets cut off before starting. Heading to a swimming pool to cool off, he pictures sheet music lines on the pool floor and finally comes up with the new song, which he writes out by hand (""Swimming"").At the workshop are friends, family, and industry professionals, including Sondheim. Karessa brings down the house with the new song, ""Come to Your Senses"", and Jonathan imagines Susan singing it. He receives praise but no offers to produce Superbia. Rosa tells him he must keep writing, hoping that something will succeed, but he will likely face more rejection. Discouraged, Jonathan runs to Michael begging for a corporate job and perceived stability, but Michael changes his mind after seeing the workshop, encouraging Jonathan to continue in musical theater. When Jonathan accuses him of not understanding what it's like to be running out of time, Michael reveals he is HIV-positive (""Real Life""). Finally grasping his career obsession has cost him his relationship with Susan and jeopardized his friendship with Michael, Jonathan wanders through New York before finding himself at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. Hopping a fence to a piano, he reflects on his friendship with Michael and the sacrifices he must make, affirming he will continue his musical theater career (""Why""). He and Michael reconcile.On the morning of Jonathan's 30th birthday Sondheim calls, congratulating him on the workshop and wanting to talk more about Superbia, lifting his spirits. Holding his birthday party at the Moondance Diner, attended by his friends, he is relieved to hear Freddy is to be discharged from the hospital. Susan gifts him blank sheet music paper to help in his career, promising to see ""the next one."" She narrates that the ""next one"" was Tick, Tick... Boom!, before he returned to working on a previous project, which became Rent. She reveals he died of an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm the night before Rent's premiere Off-Broadway. He never experienced the success he desired, but his work lives on. In 1992, Jonathan performs the final song from Tick, Tick... Boom!, watching his friends and family in the audience, including Susan in the back (""Louder Than Words"").","On the brink of turning 30, a promising theater composer navigates love, friendship and the pressure to create something great before time runs out."

Some years later, a grown Love, now an outlaw, kills one of Buck's former gang members. Meanwhile, his partners, sharpshooter Bill Pickett and quick-draw Jim Beckwourth, ambush another gang and steal their haul from a recent bank robbery. The lone survivor tells them that the $25,000 they have stolen belongs to Buck. Love travels to meet his former lover Mary Fields who runs a chain of saloons. Pickett brings news of the heist to Love. Buck's gang, led by Trudy Smith and quick-draw Cherokee Bill ambush a train on which Buck is being transported by a group of corrupt soldiers. The soldiers reluctantly release Buck, who orders all of them killed save for the youngest. Buck and his gang return to their home of Redwood, where Trudy has a saloon. The town is now run by Buck's former associate Wiley Escoe. Although left in charge by Buck, Esco has used the position for profit at the expense of the town. Buck beats him and orders him to leave town. Buck gathers the townspeople and tells them they will need $50,000 to save the town and proposes a tax to raise that money. He kills a man who objects, but accepts that the townsfolk cannot raise the full amount he needs. In Field's saloon, Marshal Bass Reeves arrives to arrest Love and removes him in handcuffs. The arrest was staged by Reeves and Love in order to hunt down Buck without involving Love's gang: Reeves is angry because Buck has been pardoned, and he knows Love wants revenge. Love's gang, however, accompanied by Fields and her friend Cuffee, suspecting a ruse, follow Love and Reeves and insist on joining. They encounter Escoe, who tells them that Buck has returned to Redwood. Fields volunteers to scout Redwood under the cover of offering to buy Smith's saloon. The night before she leaves, Love proposes to her, but she turns him down. When Fields arrives in Redwood, Smith takes her prisoner and beats her, then says she will hold Fields hostage for a day and then kill her unless someone comes to fetch her. Love's gang arrives the same night, but Smith insists that Love join Fields in captivity, which he does. Smith has Love beaten, then Buck tells him that in order to release Fields, Love will need to rob a bank in Marysville, a White town and give Buck the money. Love and Cuffee rob the bank without killing anyone, and escape with the money. Reeves and Love agree that Buck will not release Mary even if they hand over the money. Escoe supplies them with a cart full of guns and dynamite. They take the money into Redwood, in two cars, one of which is a dummy, both primed with dynamite. After the dummy wagon is destroyed, killing some of Buck's henchmen, Love hands over the money, but is stopped from leaving by Cherokee Bill. Beckwourth challenges Bill to a quick-draw contest, but is shot and killed by Bill while counting down. A gunfight erupts during which Pickett, Cuffee, Reeves and Love kill most of Buck's gang, and the money is destroyed in another explosion. Escoe infiltrates Buck's house with more dynamite, but is killed by Buck, while Pickett and Love are wounded. Fields is freed by Cuffee, and pursues Smith, who she defeats in a hand-to-hand fight. During a lull, Pickett is shot in the back by Bill, who is subsequently killed by Cuffee. Love enters Buck's house, but finds Buck unwilling to defend himself. Instead, Buck tells him about his own parents: his outlaw father killed his mother after a long period of abuse, and then abandoned Buck when he was ten years old. Buck subsequently hunted his father down, finding he changed his ways and name, and reveals that his father was also Love's. While he killed his father in revenge, he says the real revenge was driving Love into an outlaw, and that he scarred Love's face so that he would recognize him when he saw him again. Love then shoots Buck dead. Love and his companions bury Pickett and Beckwourth alongside another grave marked ""Nat Love."" Reeves will report Love as dead and Cuffee joins Reeves in law enforcement. Fields and Love ride off, as Smith looks on from a distance.","When an outlaw discovers his enemy is being released from prison, he reunites his gang to seek revenge."

Extreme daytime temperatures have forced most of the population to live at night.Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) and his friend Emily ""Watts"" Sanders (Thandiwe Newton) operate a business that allows people to relive memories. One day, a walk-in client, Mae (Rebecca Ferguson), asks for their help finding her missing keys. Nick is instantly attracted to her; observing her memories of that evening, he learns she is a nightclub singer and feels a connection with her when she sings his favorite song, ""Where or When"". Nick and Mae begin a relationship, although Watts distrusts her.
DA Avery wants Nick to help put Land mafia Walter Sylvain in the memories machine to prove that he ordered burning down of a residential building, so he could later acquire it for pennies on the dollar. But Walter is sick, and his lawyers argue that he is in no state to be subjected to this test.Months later, Mae has disappeared without a word. Watts thinks she has moved on, but Nick believes she might be in some kind of trouble. Hoping to find a clue to her whereabouts, Nick spends hours repeatedly reliving his memories of their relationship, a dangerous practice that could forever trap him in the memory.Prosecutor Avery Castillo (Natalie Martinez) hires Nick and Watts to retrieve memories from a comatose suspect who worked for a drug kingpin named Saint Joe (Daniel Wu) in New Orleans. In the man's memories, Nick sees that Mae was once Saint Joe's mistress and had become addicted to ""Baca,"" a highly addictive narcotic. The memories also reveal that Mae stole Saint Joe's stash of Baca before fleeing town. Nick is devastated to learn that Mae was an addict, something that Watts already knew.Nick travels to New Orleans and confronts Saint Joe, who says he has heard nothing from Mae since she left him. Saint Joe has his men try to drown Nick, but Watts rescues him and kills Saint Joe and his crew. Back in Miami, Nick has Watts relive her last encounter with Mae, and discovers Mae broke into the vault where they store recordings of their clients' memories. They discover Mae stole recordings of Elsa Carine (Angela Sarafyan), a client who repeatedly relived her trysts with an older, wealthy lover. Nick recognizes the voice of her lover as Walter Sylvan (Brett Cullen), a wealthy ""land baron"" who has recently died.Investigating, Nick learns that Elsa was recently murdered, and her young son was kidnapped by a woman who matches Mae's description. While searching for Mae, Nick is attacked by Cyrus Boothe (Cliff Curtis), a former henchman & corrupt cop working for Saint Joe. But Boothe and Joe had a falling out and Boothe moved to Miami. He is now working for Walter Sylvan.
Watts realizes that Nick is getting deeper and deeper into his obsession with finding Mae. She reveals that she loves Nick and begs him to stay in his current life. But Nick fires Watts and decides to pursue Mae.Realizing that Elsa's son was likely the child of Walter Sylvan and thus a potential heir to his fortune, Nick confronts Sylvan's widow, Tamara (Marina De Tavira), a former client whose memory has been damaged. In a moment of lucidity, Tamara points Nick to a place where Boothe and Mae could be hiding. Nick tracks Boothe down. Nick and Boothe fight, with Boothe almost drowning before Nick can subdue him. Nick takes Boothe back to his office and hooks him up to the machine to view his memories.Boothe's memories reveal that the basis of Mae's relationship with Nick was a lie: after Boothe enlisted her in a plan to con Nick, she researched Nick to learn how to seduce him better and staged the loss of her keys. But the memories also show that Mae came to genuinely love Nick. When Boothe murdered Elsa, Mae took Elsa's son and fled, stashing him at an unknown location. Later, Boothe found Mae and tried to force her to reveal the child's location.Nick watches the memory as Mae delivers a speech to Boothe, which is actually meant for him. She indirectly reveals the location of Elsa's son and professes her love for Nick. Then, seeing only one way out of her situation, Mae takes a lethal dose of Baca and jumps off a balcony to her death.
Devastated, Nick forces Boothe to relive his worst memory: when Saint Joe's men burned his face as punishment for skimming profits. He burns Boothe's memory, so he has to relive this memory again and again, in endless pain.
He confronts Sylvan's legitimate son Sebastian (Mojean Aria), who hired Boothe to eliminate Elsa and his half-brother to protect his inheritance. Sebastian almost commits suicide, but he changes his mind and is arrested.Nick confesses to Watts that he intentionally ""burned"" Boothe's memories, a major crime. He is convicted and allowed to serve his sentence using his machine to relive his time with Mae, which is implied to be the rest of his life. In his memory, Nick recounts to Mae a shortened version of the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, ending with the lovers reunited and happy, before the story's usual conclusion.","Nick Bannister, a private investigator of the mind, navigates the alluring world of the past when his life is changed by new client Mae.

Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu (Colin Firth), a Hebrew lawyer, remains in England while his wife, Iris (Hattie Morahan), and children travel to safety in the United States. Montagu worries that if Hitler reaches London a Hebrew family would be on the hit list. But Iris also plans a divorce from Montagu as she feels if he really cared, he would come to US with them.
Montagu takes a hiatus from practicing law when he is appointed to the Twenty Committee (under the garb of serving as a nautical supply officer). His loyal secretary, Hester Leggett (Penelope Wilton), comes with him.Winston Churchill (Simon Russell Beale) has promised the United States that the Allies will invade Sicily by July of that year in order to push northward into Europe. However, Sicily is considered an obvious target and may be defended by the Wehrmacht. Admiral Godfrey (Jason Isaacs) informs the Twenty Committee that Britain must trick Nazi Germany into believing the Allies will invade Greece. Charles Cholmondeley (Matthew MacFadyen) proposes an operation from the Trout Memo, which would entail a corpse carrying false secrets and washing ashore in Spain (which is under German occupation). Despite Godfrey's doubts (he feels this is a simple deception and the Nazis would see right through it), he gives Montagu and Cholmondeley permission to plan the operation with Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming (Johnny Flynn).
The plan has many loopholes. The body could disintegrate on impact (when thrown from the air). Autopsy could reveal that the person didn't die from drowning. Also, the contents of the briefcase could be returned by the Spanish, without ever being opened.Operation Mincemeat sets up an office. As planning gets underway, Montagu and Cholmondeley obtain the body of a vagrant named Glyndwr Michael (Lorne MacFadyen), who died by possible suicidal poisoning. The team gives him the false identity of Major William Martin, Royal Marines, complete with a detailed backstory, ID photos (Photographs taken of a person who looks just like Glyndwr), and an engagement. A widowed secretary in the office, Jean Leslie (Kelly Macdonald), offers a photo of herself to serve as the fake fiance. Cholmondeley has a crush on Jean, but soon realizes that Montagu and Jean have romantic feelings for one another. This causes Cholmondeley to grow jealous and occasionally lash out at Montagu.Godfrey suspects Montagu's brother, Ivor (Mark Gatiss), is a spy for Russia. He bribes Cholmondeley to spy on Montagu and, in return, Godfrey will locate and return the remains of Cholmondeley's brother, who was killed in action in Chittagong, Bengal. Cholmondeley reluctantly agrees.Decision is made to deliver the dead body by submarine, rather than by air thereby avoiding disintegration. The minute details of the plan are discussed with the British Naval attache in Spain Salvador Gomez-Beare (Will Keen) & Captain David Ainsworth (Nicholas Rowe), once the body arrives there with the secret papers. 2 German spies are identified who are key to finding the papers, thereby making sure that the contents of the briefcase are communicated to Berlin. In Berlin Col Von Roenne is the head of German intelligence. For anything to make its way to Hitler, the information would have to be endorsed by Von Roenne, who is a brilliant spy. But Von Roenne is suspected to be anti-Hitler.Meanwhile Cholmondeley confirms that Ivor is a spy for the Russians but has not yet revealed the existence of Operation Mincemeat to the Russians. Cholmondeley reveals to Jean that Montagu is married and that his wife and 2 kids live in England. Jean is devastated and confronts Montagu.
Specialist MI5 driver St John ""Jock"" Horsfall (Mark Bonnar) transports Montagu, Cholmondeley, and the corpse to the R.N. Submarine Base in Holy Loch. The corpse is then loaded onto the submarine HMS Seraph, under the command of Lt. Bill Jewell (Rufus Wright). At the last-minute Cholmondeley changes the plan and decides to ride on the Seraph to Spain. This angers Montagu. Montagu goes to Jean and professes his love for her.On the morning of 30 April, the Seraph arrives in the Gulf of Cádiz and drops the corpse into the ocean. It is found by fishermen in Huelva, Spain. Operation Mincemeat attempts to get the fake documents to Madrid. However, the mission is hampered by bad luck, as the Spanish have resisted Nazi corruption better than expected. The Spanish navy summons Salvador Gomez-Beare and offers to return the briefcase to him, without routing them through the Nazis.
Captain David Ainsworth (Nicholas Rowe), the British naval attache in Madrid, meets with Colonel Cerruti of the Spanish secret police (who is known to a fascist and devoted to Hitler) in one last attempt to get the papers to the Nazis. When Martin's personal things are returned to London, a specialist at Q Branch figures out that the documents were tampered with (The letters were folded in a particular manner before shipping and the fold patterns upon their return were analyzed and found to be different). This gives Operation Mincemeat hope that Germany retrieved the false information.
Hester tells Jean that Iris and Montagu are separated for the moment.Jean is ambushed and threatened by Teddy (Jonjo O'Neill), a man claiming to be a spy for an anti-Hitler plot within Germany. Teddy knew Jean from the club which she frequented with Cholmondeley and Montagu. He wants to know why Jean's photograph was found on Martin's body.
She tells him that Major Martin was travelling under an alias, but the classified information was genuine. He was carrying Jean's photo as it was stolen, and probably Martin was secretly having a crush on her. After Teddy leaves, Jean informs Montagu and Cholmondeley. They come to believe that Colonel Alexis Von Roenne, who controls intelligence in the Nazi High Command, sent Teddy to verify information (for it to be false) so Von Roenne could undermine Hitler by leading him down the wrong path. However, they have no way of being completely sure. Montagu takes Jean to his home for protection, but she accepts a job in Special Operations and soon leaves London.On 10 July, the invasion of Sicily commences. The news arrives that the Allied Forces suffered limited casualties, the enemy is retreating, and the beaches have been held. Afterwards, Cholmondeley admits he received his brother's remains in return for spying on Montagu. Feeling sympathetic and relieved that Operation Mincemeat was a success, Montagu offers to buy Cholmondeley a drink even though it's eight in the morning.The epilogue explains that Montagu reunited with Iris after the war, Jean married a soldier, Hester continued as Director of the Admiralty Secretarial Unit, and Cholmondeley remained with MI5 until 1952, later married, and traveled widely. Major William Martin's identity was revealed to be Glyndwr Michael in 1997 when an epitaph, with his real name, was added to Martin's headstone in Spain.","During WWII, two intelligence officers use a corpse and false papers to outwit German troops."

One night, Brianna's brother Troy (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) shares the urban legend of Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen), a white graduate student who went on a killing spree in the early 1990s. The story goes that her rampage culminated in a bonfire outside the Cabrini-Green projects, at which point she attempted to sacrifice an infant child. The residents were able to rescue the child from Helen before she perished in the fire in an apparent act of self-immolation.Desperate for a creative spark to turn his career around, Anthony latches on to this story and roams around Cabrini-Green looking for inspiration. He eventually has a chance encounter with William Burke (Colman Domingo), a launderette owner who introduces him to the story of Candyman. When Burke was a child, he had a frightening encounter with Sherman Fields (Michael Hargrove), a hook-handed man whom the police believed was responsible for putting a razor blade in a piece of candy that ended up in the hands of a white girl. Burke inadvertently alerted the police to his presence in the walls of one of the tower blocks, leading them to beat Sherman to death. Sherman was later exonerated when more children received candy with razor blades. The legend goes that repeating the name ""Candyman"" five times in front of a mirror invokes Sherman's spirit, at which point he appears in the reflection and kills whoever spoke his name.Inspired by this, Anthony develops an art exhibit around the legend of Candyman and showcases it at Brianna's gallery but is dismayed when he does not get the kind of reaction he was hoping for. That night, one of Brianna's co-workers and his girlfriend are slaughtered by Candyman after saying his name five times in front of a mirror. Their bodies are discovered in the morning by Brianna. More people are killed after repeating Candyman's name including an art critic and a group of teenage girls.Meanwhile, Anthony begins to undergo a physical transformation stemming from a bee sting he suffered on his hand while walking around Cabrini-Green. The sting develops into a scab that begins to spread and cover his whole body. Anthony later goes to a hospital to get checked out, where he learns that his mother lied about where he was born. Anthony soon pays a visit to his mother (Vanessa Williams), who reveals he was the baby Helen Lyle saved from the fire the night she died. Though the truth is that Helen saved him from Candyman, who abducted him and planned to sacrifice him in the fire, she never told him about it because she wanted Anthony to have a chance at a normal life. The community had vowed never to repeat the legend of Candyman after that night and his mother fears what will happen to Anthony now that someone has broken their pact. Anthony leaves resigned to his fate and wanders the row houses of Cabrini-Green.Concerned about Anthony, Brianna recalls him mentioning that he first heard about Candyman from Burke, so she heads to Cabrini-Green in hopes of finding him. Once there, Burke subdues Brianna and takes her to an abandoned church, where Anthony has entered a fugue state as his body continues to deteriorate.Burke reveals that not only did he witness the police beat Sherman to death but he also saw Sherman return later as the Candyman after which he butchered his older sister when she summoned him in the bathroom mirror of their apartment. He plans to have Anthony gunned down by the police, creating a new legend in which Candyman is an instrument of vengeance rather than a symbol of Black pain and suffering. To complete Anthony's transformation into Candyman, he saws off his right hand and replaces it with a hook.Brianna manages to escape the church and is chased into the Cabrini Green row houses by Burke, whom she viciously stabs to death. Anthony appears and collapses into her arms as the police, lured to the scene by Burke, show up and shoot Anthony to death. Brianna is handcuffed and placed in the back of a police SUV, where an officer attempts to intimidate her into agreeing that Anthony provoked the other officer into shooting him. Brianna uses the car's rearview mirror to summon Anthony, now Candyman, and he massacres every police officer at the scene. As more police arrive, Candyman takes on the appearance of Daniel Robitaille (Tony Todd) and gives Brianna a single instruction: ""Tell everyone.""",A sequel to the horror film Candyman (1992) that returns to the now-gentrified Chicago neighborhood where the legend began.

Seeking to avoid attention - either fame or casino bouncers - Tell's gambling philosophy is to bet small and win modestly. Despite gambling nearly every day, he never stays in a casino hotel. He lives out of two small suitcases and stays in motels, where he removes any decor and covers all the furniture in plain sheets secured with twine.
At a casino, Tell encounters La Linda, an acquaintance from the gambling world. She runs a stable, a group of investors who back gamblers for a portion of their winnings. She offers to stake William but he refuses, unwilling to be burdened by the responsibility.
In Atlantic City, a security-industry convention is being held in the same building as the casino. Tell slips into a seminar held by retired Major John Gordo, but decides to leave almost immediately. On the way out, he is recognized and confronted by a young man, Cirk Baufort, who slips him his name and number. After a nightmare about torture in a prison camp, Tell calls the young man and agrees to meet. Cirk informs Tell he knows who he really is: PFC William Tillich, a soldier who was tried and convicted for his role in the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. Cirk explains that his father, Roger Baufort, was also at Abu Ghraib; like Tell, he was dishonorably discharged and served time, but the experience led him to drug addiction and made him violently abusive. Cirk's mother left the family, and Roger eventually killed himself. Gordo was the superior of Tillich and the elder Baufort and trained them in enhanced interrogation techniques, but as he was involved as a ""civilian consultant"" avoided facing any charges or culpability. Cirk holds Gordo responsible for what happened to his family and is planning to capture, torture, and kill him for revenge and seeks Tell's help. Tell refuses but offers to take Cirk along as he gambles in an attempt to help the young man avoid a violent life.
At their next stop, Tell informs La Linda that he is interested in making an arrangement. He reveals to her his desire to go on the World Series of Poker tour in order to win enough money to help Cirk cover his debts and start a new life, after which Tell will retire. After early WSOP matches, Tell makes money but loses to Mr. USA, an obnoxious Ukrainian player who has taken on a jingoistic American persona. He bonds with Cirk and feels a growing attraction to La Linda, but avoids getting too close as he continues making money gambling.
At a qualifying round in Panama City, Cirk shares that he still plans to kill Gordo. Tell takes Cirk back to his motel, confronting the younger man with a harsh interrogator persona. He presents Cirk with $150,000 from his gambling winnings, enough for Cirk to pay off his and his mother's debts and return to college. He insists Cirk return to his mother in Oregon and forget about Gordo, threatening violence if he does not comply; Cirk leaves with the money. Tell, who has begun a relationship with La Linda, advances to the final table of the WSOP. While on a break he receives a message from Cirk, revealing that rather than returning home he went to Gordo's house to kill him. Tell is unsettled and, distracted during the resumed match, abruptly walks off the casino floor. A news report shows that Gordo had killed an armed home intruder - Cirk.
Tell drives through the night to get to Gordo's house, covering the furniture as he does in his motel rooms. Gordo returns home and Tell holds him at gunpoint, revealing who he is and why he is there. Rather than shooting him, Tell takes Gordo into another room for a ""dramatic reenactment"" of their time in Abu Gharib. Both men are heard screaming in agony, and eventually Tell emerges from the room severely wounded. He calls the police to report a homicide.
Tell is incarcerated in the same military prison as before, accepting the routine and ascetic setting as he feels it is what he deserves. La Linda arrives for a visit and the two reach out to each other, each placing a single finger on the glass separating them.","Redemption is the long game in Paul Schrader's THE CARD COUNTER.

Chu'],"The film opens on a beach, as Usnavi (Ramos) tells a group of children the story of Washington Heights. He tells them about the concept of a sueñito, a little dream that everyone has. He begins the story in the middle of the summer in Washington Heights, introducing the main characters of the film: Abuela Claudia (Merediz), the aged matriarch of the neighborhood who took him in and raised him, Kevin Rosario (Smits), who runs the taxi company, the salon ladies Daniela (Rubin-Vega), Carla (Beatriz) and Cuca (Polanco), his younger cousin Sonny (Diaz), who he employs, Benny (Hawkins), who is employed by Kevin at the taxi company, and Vanessa (Barrera), who works at the salon and is Usnavi's love interest, as they each pass by his neighborhood bodega for their morning coffee before they carry on with their day (""In The Heights"").Alejandro, who runs the local law firm, stops by the bodega to inform Usnavi that his father's old business in the Dominican Republic has been put back up for sale and can be purchased, something Usnavi has always dreamed of buying and reviving; his sueñito. Meanwhile, Nina Rosario (Grace), Kevin's daughter, returns to the neighborhood from her first year at Stanford University. After a quick reunion with Benny (""Benny's Dispatch""), Usnavi, Sonny and Abuela, she goes to find her father, while dreading telling him of her plans to drop out, due to a combination of loneliness and financial troubles, in doing so letting her neighborhood down (""Breathe""). She meets her father and tells him that she would be unable to pay tuition fees in time, but he brushes her off, telling her not to worry.Elsewhere in the neighborhood, Daniela, Carla, Vanessa and Cuca work at the neighborhood salon, which will be moving soon to the Bronx due to rising rent. Nina arrives at the salon for a treatment, and they happily oblige, all the while gossiping about her and Vanessa's love interests (""No Me Diga""). The attention soon turns to her studies however, and she is forced to reveal that she has dropped out of university, and leaves. Vanessa, on her lunch break, goes to submit a rental application to pursue her sueñito of moving downtown to become a fashion designer (""It Won't Be Long Now""). However, she is unable to provide a good credit check and her application is rejected. Disappointed, she heads back to the neighborhood and drops by Usnavi's bodega, where Sonny manages to ask her out on the weekend, on Usnavi's behalf.Due to the summer heat, the entire neighborhood closes up shop early to head to the local pool. Just as Usnavi, Sonny, and Benny prepare to leave, Sonny receives a call that one of the lottery tickets the bodega has sold has won $96,000. They and the rest of the neighborhood begin to fantasize about achieving their own sueñitos with the money if they were the ones who won (""96,000""). Meanwhile, Mr. Piraguero (Miranda) laments how Mister Softee (Jackson) is stealing his business (""Piragua"").That weekend, Benny and Nina meet at the park to hang out, as they reminisce about their childhoods spent in the neighborhood. She expresses her doubts and her fears about her self-worth to Benny, but he reassures her that she is destined for greatness (""When You're Home""). Afterwards, Benny walks in on a meeting between Kevin and the dry-cleaner next door, who has tried to buy over the lot where Kevin's business is. Meanwhile, Usnavi goes to talk to Sonny's father about letting him go with him to the Dominican Republic, but Sonny's father informs him that he and Sonny are undocumented immigrants.That evening, Usnavi, Sonny, Abuela, and the salon ladies gather at Kevin and Nina's house for a dinner party. Later on, Benny arrives and questions Kevin about his earlier meeting with the dry cleaner, forcing Kevin to reveal his news: he called Stanford, and has sold the business to pay for Nina's tuition. Outraged that he went behind her back, Nina refuses the money and storms out, followed by Benny, as Kevin tells the rest of the guests to leave. Usnavi and Vanessa head to the club for their date, along with Benny and Nina. At the club, Usnavi is overly nervous and aloof, and Vanessa dances with other men to make him jealous. Usnavi finds his own partner and tries to make her jealous in turn (""The Club""). Suddenly, the power goes out in the neighborhood, and in the ensuing chaos, Vanessa and Usnavi get separated. Sonny and Graffiti Pete light up fireworks to illuminate the neighborhood, while Benny and Kevin return to the taxi company to direct cars and taxis. Vanessa and Usnavi find each other and argue about their date; Vanessa angrily rejects him and they both go home (""Blackout"").Nina and the salon ladies go to Usnavi's apartment, where they play bingo and revel in the fireworks. Abuela, lying in bed, reminisces about her childhood in Cuba, living in poverty, and how she and her mother came to New York, enduring hardships to be where she is today, as she passes away, her heart unable to take the summer heat (""Paciencia Y Fe""). Usnavi discovers her unresponsive and calls the emergency hotline, but it is too late. The entire neighborhood comes together to mourn her passing and sing her praises (""Alabanza"").At a neighborhood protest for DACA, Nina learns that Sonny cannot go to college as he is an undocumented immigrant. She resolves to go back to university to find a way for undocumented children like Sonny to find a pathway in life. She informs Kevin of her decision, and he happily tells her that she has surpassed him, and encourages her to pursue her goals, telling her to disregard anything negative people say about her.While clearing out the trash, Usnavi discovers Vanessa's rental application that she had thrown away. He visits Daniela as she is packing up and preparing to move her business, asking her to co-sign on Vanessa's application. Afterwards, disappointed with the block's negative attitudes over the blackout and Abuela's passing, Daniela rouses them into a celebration of their shared Latin culture, as the entire neighborhood joins in (""Carnaval Del Barrio""). Vanessa and Sonny express reservations, but Usnavi convinces them to let go of their worries and celebrate in the moment, as the blackout finally ends.A month later, Nina finishes packing to return to Stanford, and she and Benny agree to pursue a long-distance relationship. Benny reaffirms his faith in her, and promises to make his way over to California to be with her, as they finally kiss (""When The Sun Goes Down""). At the same time, as Usnavi finishes preparing to leave for the Dominican Republic the next day, he discovers that Abuela held the winning lottery ticket, and has passed it on to him. Just at that moment, Vanessa shows up and flirts with him, having found out that Usnavi convinced Daniela to co-sign on her lease, and bought him a bottle of champagne to thank him. She quietly suggests that Usnavi should stay, but he refuses. Distraught, she finally kisses him, and laments that she was too late in realizing her feelings for him (""Champagne"").Afterwards, Usnavi visits Alejandro and Sonny, giving him the winning ticket and telling him to use it for Sonny's legal fees as he applies for documentation. The next morning, Usnavi walks around the neighborhood one last time, and runs into Vanessa. She takes him to his old bodega and shows him a new fashion line she created the previous night, having been inspired by Graffiti Pete's paint rags. Graffiti Pete has painted a mural across the wall of the beach where Usnavi's father's old business used to be, and another one celebrating Abuela Claudia and her famous motto, ""Paciencia y fe"" (Patience and Faith). Usnavi has an epiphany and tasks Sonny and Pete with telling the neighborhood of his decision to stay. The story returns to the present day, where the beach where Usnavi is telling his story is revealed to be the new shop that he and Vanessa built together, he is revealed to have married Vanessa, and one of the children is revealed to be Usnavi's daughter.The film ends with present-day Usnavi, Vanessa and their daughter dancing with the rest of the neighborhood, and past Usnavi accepting the neighborhood as his true home (""Finale"").In a post-credits scene, Piraguero is celebrating the overflow of customers now that the Mister Softee truck broke down, and gives the Mister Softee driver a piragua.

Jaffe and his shaman Baba reveal to a baffled Akeem that he had sired a son during his first visit in Queens, New York, after his aide Semmi had enticed two women into spending the night with them while Akeem was still searching for his future queen. One of them inadvertently drugged Akeem, resulting in a tryst he did not remember. As Zamundian tradition demands that only a male successor can inherit the throne, and Akeem has fathered only daughters, Akeem is forced to travel back to Queens to retrieve his son. If not, Zamunda could face a hostile takeover by Zamunda's militaristic neighbor nation Nexdoria, whose dictator, General Izzi (the brother of Imani, Akeem's original arranged bride-to-be), has been pushing for Akeem's eldest daughter Meeka into marrying his foppish son, Idi.Following King Jaffe's funeral and Akeem's ascension to king, he and Semmi travel back to Queens to find his illegitimate son. During a lighthearted reunion with the barbershop gang they bonded with, head barber Mr. Clarence informs them that the son in question is Lavelle Junson, a ticket scalper who hustles outside of Madison Square Garden. After an awkward reunion with Lavelle's mother Mary, Akeem takes them back to Zamunda, much to his family's displeasure. When General Izzi learns of this, he drops by to introduce his daughter Bopoto to Lavelle as a last shot at laying claim to the throne of Zamunda, but in order to qualify as a royal prince, Lavelle first has to pass a series of traditional - and hazardous - tests.Lavelle is at first highly reluctant to place himself in danger, but then bonds with Mirembe, a royal groomer, who tells him of Akeem's quest to find his queen and encourages him to follow his own path. Lavelle then invites his uncle Reem, Mary's streetwise brother, to Zamunda who coaches him on how to blend his urban upbringing with his new royal status. Lavelle gradually develops an understanding with Akeem's family and, using his wits and some forced courage, he passes and is made Prince of Zamunda. However, at his accession party, Lavelle overhears a conversation between Akeem and Izzi which makes him believe that Akeem is just exploiting him, and he, Mirembe, Mary and Reem go back to New York. Upset at losing Mary, whom she has befriended, Lisa locks Akeem out of their bedroom. After a pep talk from his father-in-law Cleo, who reminds him of late Queen Aoleon's progressive mind, Akeem flies back to the States, while Semmi is left to stall Izzi, who intends to return the next day to either see Bopoto marry Lavelle or declare war.Returning to Queens, Akeem finds that Lavelle and Mirembe are about to get married. Confronted by Lavelle and reminded of his own life story, he gives them his blessing and releases Lavelle from his marriage to Bopoto. When Mirembe expresses reluctance in the couple cutting all of their ties to Zamunda, Akeem offers to fly Mary's family back for a proper wedding. In the meantime, Semmi and the princesses, all trained staff fighters, fight off and subdue General Izzi when he invades the palace, forcing him to try a more diplomatic approach. Upon his return home, Akeem changes the royal succession by allowing his daughter Meeka to ascend to the throne upon his death, while Lavelle is made an ambassador to the United States, and General Izzi has opened Nexdoria for a peaceful political and trading relationship. The film concludes with a grand party at the royal palace to celebrate Lavelle and Mirembe's marriage, including the barbers from Queens as special guests and a performance of the song ""We Are Family"" from Sexual Chocolate.(copied from Wikipedia)",The African monarch Akeem learns he has a long-lost son in the United States and must return to America to meet this unexpected heir and build a relationship with his son.

Only inmates from the upper and middle castes get released. The police blame people from lower caste accusing them of perpetrating crimes in multiple pending cases.[6] Rajakannu and Sengeni are a couple from the Irula tribe who labor in the fields of upper-caste men to control rat infestation and catch venomous snakes. Rajakannu is called to a rich man's dwelling to catch a snake that sneaked inside a room.The next day, a case of burglary is reported when the wife of the man reports missing jewellery pieces from her closet and raises doubt on Rajakannu. The police invade Rajakannu's home to find evidence. Rajakannu had left the town earlier for work. During the invasion, the police brutally beat and unlawfully detains his pregnant wife. The police arrest other relatives, Rajakannu's brother, Iruttupan, his sister Pachaiammal and his brother-in-law, Mosakutty and torture them to confess the whereabouts of Rajakannu. The police find Rajakannu and imprison him. They brutally torture him to confess the crime but releases his wife. Later, Sengeni is informed that all three men in detention are absconding and police threaten her furthermore to tell them about their whereabouts.Mythra, who teaches adults from Irula tribe, gets to know about Chandru, a lawyer who fights cases for tribal communities, and manages to convince him to seek justice for Sengeni. After listening to the narration of all events that happened until then from Sengeni, Chandru files a habeas corpus case in the court. The public attorney, in defence of the police, produces eye-witnesses to concoct a story that Rajakannu and the other two indeed absconded from jail. Finding gaps in the eye-witnesses' statements, Chandru uncovers that they were committing perjury and asks the court to investigate two police officers - Sub-Inspector Gurumurthy, a casteist cop and constable Veerasamy.Advocate general Ram Mohan takes over the case and in defence of the police, claims that the three accused have fled to Kerala when Varadarajulu, the employer of Iruttapan, acknowledges that Iruttapan informed him through a phone call that he fled to Kerala after committing robbery. In retort, Chandru manages to discover that the three cops in question went to Kerala to make a phone call to Varadarajulu which Gurumurthy admits, that he mimicked the voice of Iruttapan. Chandru and Mythra find Rajakannu dead in the middle of a road near the border of Pondicherry. Both believe that Rajakannu did not die due to a car accident, rather due to lock-up murder.Chandru consults the doctor who operated on Rajakannu. The doctor tells him that the cause of death was due to the breaking of the ribcage, but theorises that this could be caused by a car running over him. Veerasamy confesses to Ram Mohan that Rajakannu died in lock up custody. Veerasamy called Guru after the death.

At first, she offers him the same amount of money he received from the Ipswich Museum, about the minimum agricultural wage, but he says it is inadequate; she ups her offer by 12% to £2 a week, which he accepts. His former employers try unsuccessfully to persuade Brown to work on a Roman villa they deem more important. They ignore Brown, who left school aged only 12, when he suggests the mounds could be Anglo-Saxon rather than the more common Viking era.Working with a few assistants from the estate, Brown slowly excavates the more promising of the mounds. One day the trench collapses on him, but he is dug out in time and revived. Meanwhile, he spends more time with Edith, a widow, and her young son, Robert, and ignores daily letters from his wife, May. Edith struggles with health issues and is warned by her doctor to avoid stress.Brown is astonished to uncover iron rivets from a ship, which could only make it the burial site of someone of tremendous distinction, such as a king. Prominent local archaeologist James Reid Moir attempts to join the dig but is rebuffed; Edith instead hires her cousin Rory Lomax to join the project. News of the discovery soon spreads, and Cambridge archaeologist Charles Phillips arrives, declares the site to be of national importance, and takes over the dig by order of the Office of Works.As war approaches, Philips brings in a large team, including Peggy Piggott, who uncovers the first distinctively Anglo-Saxon artifact. Brown is retained only to keep the site in order, but Edith intervenes and he resumes digging. Brown discovers a Merovingian Tremissis, a small gold coin of Late Antiquity, and Philips declares the site to be of major historical significance. Philips wants to send all the items to the British Museum, but Edith, concerned about the war raids in London, asserts her rights.

Marcus is a bit neurotic as he wants to propose to Emily and wants everything to go right. When they arrive at the hotel, they find their room has been flooded because the couple in the presidential suite above them overflowed their Jacuzzi.Marcus tries to get another room, but the concierge Maurillio (Carlos Santos) can only find them a crappy Best Western hotel room nearby. To make things worse, Maurillio lets it slip that Marcus was trying to propose. Left with no choice, Marcus proposes to Emily on the spot, and she accepts. Cheering them on is another couple, Ron (John Cena) and Kyla (Meredith Hagner), who happen to be the couple in the presidential suite. They invite Marcus and Emily to stay with them, and despite some reluctance, they go along with it.The two couples get together in the suite, where Ron and Kyla give Marcus and Emily margaritas. Only after they drink it do they learn that the ""salt"" around the rim of the glass was actually cocaine. Later, Marcus and Emily want to go on a whale watching tour, only to find that the boat for it is packed with tourists. Ron and Kyla invite them to go out on their own boat, so they head out and Ron lets Marcus steer the boat. Unfortunately, Marcus doesn't see rocks ahead of them and the boat flips over. The four are airlifted out of there, and while Marcus wants to repay Ron for the boat, he and Kyla thought the experience was awesome as opposed to regular old sailing.The couples spend the whole week hanging out and partying. On their last night there, the couples are out on the beach, where Ron feels that he has come to view Marcus as something of a best friend. Ron and Kyla then come up with the idea that Marcus and Emily should get married that night. They take the two to a cave where they meet a shaman that performs a Mayan ceremony to marry Marcus and Emily. Afterward, the two couples jump off the cliff into the ocean. They go back to the hotel room for more drugs and drinking, and Marcus passes out seeing Kyla on top of him, thanking him for the experience.The next morning, Marcus and Emily are super hungover and head over to the airport to catch their flight. When they arrive, Ron and Kyla are already there just hanging out, making inappropriate jokes about Marcus and Emily as security is nearby. Ron and Kyla want to continue seeing Marcus and Emily, and they ask if they can give them their numbers, but the latter couple pretends that their phones broke, so Ron gives Marcus his business card.Seven months later, Marcus and Emily are planning for their official wedding. Marcus, who manages a construction company, finds that his employees have gotten a suit for him. He laments not being able to invite them because Emily's parents want to keep it ""intimate"". When they arrive at the venue where the wedding will take place, Marcus is surprised to see that Emily's parents invited all of their family and other wealthy friends. Marcus has tension with her family because her father Harold (Robert Wisdom) doesn't particularly like him, and he also has issues with Emily's brother Gabe (Andrew Bachelor) because Marcus punched him in the face one time.Later that night, Ron and Kyla come crashing through the gate of the venue and pretend to angrily confront Marcus and Emily for not inviting them, before they burst out laughing at the gag. Harold approaches them, and Ron immediately wins him over by showing that he is a former Green Beret. Harold allows Ron and Kyla to stay in the one room that was available - the presidential suite. When Marcus and Emily ask them what they are doing there all of a sudden, Kyla reveals that she is pregnant, and they imply that Marcus had a big part to play in this, and based on what he remembers from the trip, he freaks out.The following morning, Harold invites Ron to join him and the others for a fox hunt, which doesn't actually involve hunting a fox, but rather chasing after one even though nobody has seen a fox around there in forever. Marcus and Ron go off together, where Ron shows Marcus which items to forage for food. Meanwhile, Harold expresses to Emily and Kyla that he didn't get along with his own father-in-law, and Emily notes the same thing is happening with him and Marcus. When the guys get to a special mushroom, Marcus eats it before Ron can explain that it is an extremely potent psychedelic mushroom. Marcus starts to trip balls almost instantly, so Ron eats one mushroom to help him. The two space out until Marcus is pounced on by what he believes is a fox attacking him. He nearly grabs a knife to kill it until Ron stops him to point out Harold and his group, revealing that the ""fox"" was actually Harold's dog playfully pouncing on Marcus. Harold tries to approach Marcus with respectful intents, but Marcus's hallucinations make him see Harold as a clown, and is unable to stop laughing. Ron steps in and saves him by saying that he knows Marcus wants nothing more than to make a good impression on Harold.Ron later joins Marcus as they go golfing against Gabe and his buddy Bennet (Kamal Bolden), while Kyla continues to hang out with Emily and her family. Emily gets nervous because Kyla is giving ""special"" medicine to her Grandma Phyllis (Denise Burse), who is typically quiet and doesn't move around too much because of her condition. While on the golf course, Ron appears super drunk and they keep missing every hole they come across. In the middle of the game, Ron takes out a lot of money, which he reveals he got from pawning off Marcus and Emily's wedding rings. Marcus is livid until Ron wagers with Gabe and Bennet for all the money, plus Bennet's Ferrari. Ron pulls off an impressive swing on the last hole to get a hole in one.The guys go to the pawnshop just before it closes, and Marcus gets the rings back. Ron sees a bird flying overhead, and because he earlier told Marcus that he knows when a bird is going to poop, he pushes Marcus out of the way just before he gets crapped on...and this causes Marcus to drop the rings down the sewer. He begins to freak out on Ron for causing all of this, and Ron starts telling Marcus that he helped Kyla conceive a child after doctors told him that he is sterile, seemingly confirming that Marcus really is the father of Kyla's child.That night, the family hosts a party, where Marcus's construction buddies show up after being invited by Ron. Ron and Kyla then go up on stage to announce to everyone how Marcus has lent a hand in helping them have a baby. Before Kyla can finish her sentence, Marcus tries to own up to it himself and declare to everyone that he is the father of Kyla's baby after they had the drug-fueled sexual encounter. It actually turns out that this is not the case - after the couples did their cliff dive, Ron thinks that the impact the water landing had on his balls caused him to undo his infertility, and so he successfully impregnated Kyla. Emily stands up to admit that it was she who had sex with Kyla, and they were just on top of Marcus, who wasn't involved in it. Harold angrily berates Marcus, who then reveals that he lost the rings. When Gabe tries to berate him too, Marcus punches him in the face again. A brawl then breaks out between Gabe's friends and Marcus's construction buddies, and Marcus leaves dejectedly. On the way out, Ron and Kyla try to talk to Marcus and Emily, but the two of them snap at the other couple and say that they were never friends and deliberately avoided keeping in touch with them because of how crazy they are. Ron and Kyla are hurt and agree to leave.On the morning of Marcus and Emily's wedding, the two believe that there won't be a wedding. Harold then comes in with the construction guys, all of them very drunk. Harold has loosened up and admits to Marcus that he has been hard on him, but he is willing to give him another chance, which Marcus accepts. Emily is then visited by Grandma Phyllis, who is now able to walk thanks to the medicine Kyla gave her. She gives Emily a note and gift from Kyla, which is an apology to her and Marcus for ruining their wedding, but also an admission that the two of them felt like their best friends in forever, especially because Ron's own best friend passed away and he didn't meet another guy like that until Marcus came along. In the box is the wedding rings that Ron spent all day fishing out of the sewers. Marcus and Emily feel really bad and set off to go find Ron and Kyla.Emily remembers that Kyla mentioned she and Ron like to go to Waffle House, so she and Marcus go to multiple Waffle Houses until they eventually find Ron and Kyla. Although the two are still upset with Marcus and Emily, the latter two apologize, and Marcus kisses Ron's forehead, which he had earlier said is the ultimate sign of respect. They forgive Marcus and Emily, and they still want to name their baby after Marcus. They agree to go to the wedding on the condition that Marcus and Emily go to theirs.Months later, Marcus and Emily return to the cave in Mexico along with both their families (and Baby Marcus) to watch Ron and Kyla get married. The couples then all jump off the cliff into the ocean again.","An uptight couple makes friends with a rowdy couple while on vacation in Mexico, but their friendship takes an awkward turn when they get back home."

Initially reluctant to start a fight in the middle of the night, she tells him that she is upset that she was not thanked or acknowledged in his speech at the premiere.Marie believes that she is the basis of his film, a drama about a struggling black female drug addict named Imani, as she herself was a drug addict when they met. Malcolm dismisses her accusations, claiming that the Imani is not based on her and is an amalgamation of different people. Marie insists that he would not have authentically portrayed Imani's struggles with drug abuse and addiction if they were not together. Malcolm believes that Marie is overreacting, claiming that, because she quit acting years ago, she is jealous of the actress who played Imani and that she is projecting her personal problems on him and his film.

Two years later, he discovered that Lydell Lipps was innocent and that his partner, 7-Eleven, had framed him in a personal vendetta. Charlie, who arrested Lydell Lipps, tried to prove his innocence. But he soon realized that the system was designed to put a guilty man in and not take an innocent man out of prison. In frustration, Charlie left the LAPD and gave interviews to almost anyone who was willing to hear them. His actions flamed his relationship with the system, but Charlie didn't care. He left Hollywood land and settled in the woods with 100 possessions to his name.Last Looks begins as Charlie's ex-girlfriend, Lorena Nascimento (Morena Baccarin), pays him a visit and offers him a job. A Hollywood studio, Black Bear, wants to hire Charlie as a private investigator to investigate the murder of Monica, the wife of Alastair Pinch. Alastair, who is suspected of murdering his wife, stars in Black Bear's most grossing television drama, Johnnie's Bench. The studio cannot afford to lose their star actor and thus is paying for a high-profile lawyer along with a famous private detective like Charlie, who is passionate about finding the truth.However, Charlie refuses to take the job because he desires neither fame nor name. Lorena leaves Charlie's trailer, requesting him to consider the offer.A few days later, a cop arrives at Charlie's place and informs him that Lorena has gone missing. She has stolen something of interest from her boss, Don Queue, a cartel lord. Don Q suspects that Lorena dropped his ""mem"" with Charlie and thus tries to threaten him. At night, a group of punks attack Charlie in his trailer and warn him to stay out of Pinch's case. When Charlie informs them that he hasn't accepted the job yet, the punks show him the newspaper report that claims that Charlie Waldo is investigating the murder of Monica Pinch.When Charlie fails to contact Lorena, he decides to meet with the head of the Black Bear Studio, Wilson Sikorsky (Rupert Friend), in LA. But before Charlie can refuse the job, Wilson convinces him to take the case, and Charlie becomes a private eye for Alastair Pinch.While everyone suspected Alastair for the murder of his wife, Charlie intuitively believed that there was more to the mystery than what meets the eye. Charlie started his investigation from the crime scene i.e. Alastair's house where Monica was murdered.Alastair told Charlie that dreadful Saturday, he woke up wasted with no recollection of what happened the previous night. In a state of hangover, he entered the living room and found Monica lying unconscious with an injury on her head. He found shattered piece of vase near her body which the detectives believed was used to murder Monica.The forensic doctor, Freddie, told Charlie Monica died from a cerebral hemorrhage. Charlie was certain that an earth vase could not create such an impact. While in conversation with his ex-accomplices, Charlie figured out that the killer was a strong lefty, not a drunken righty like Alastair. And Monica was probably hit with a Regis Award trophy that Alastair received in England. Unfortunately, the murder weapon was missing, and that complicated the case.While investigating the background of Monica and Alastair, Charlie met a spirited kindergarten teacher, Jayne White (Lucy Fry), who used to teach Pinch's daughter, Gabby. Jayne was extremely thrilled to meet controversial ex-cop Charlie and wanted to know all about his past life. Curiosity soon turned into a passionate romance until Charlie found a secret about Jayne.The moment Charlie stepped into Alastair's house, he suspected that the furniture had been rearranged or moved for some reason. The night table that belonged to the living room was swapped with the one in the bedroom and vice versa. On further investigation, Charlie found a burner phone hidden inside the night table in Alastair's room.Alastair used the cellphone to contact Jayne because he was having an affair with her. But Jayne confessed to Charlie that Alastair wasn't the only kindergarten dad with whom she got involved. Jayne, a young blood who came to Hollywood looking for a rush and a thrill, had no intention of becoming a teacher. When famous dads like Darius Jamshidi and Swag Dogggg showed an interest in her, Jayne used the opportunity.So Charlie finally figured out that all those people thrashing him in his trailer and trying to stop him from investigating Monica's murder case, didn't want Charlie to find out about kindergarten dads and their affair with Jayne White. Hence, when Charlie unraveled Jayne's secret, she disappeared from the scene with Alastair's unborn child.Monica found out that Jayne was pregnant with Alastair's child. Hence, on the night of her murder, she texted Jayne using Alastair's burner phone and called her to the house. Soon, Jayne thought that Alastair wanted to talk about their future, but soon her dreams were shattered. Monica confronted Jayne and blamed the glamorous city of L.A. for ruining her married life. However, according to Jayne, Monica turned violent and so she drove away.Monica wanted to return to England with Alastair and Gabby, which meant that Alastair would leave the show as well. For Black Bear Studios, Johnnie's Bench was the only show that brought in income. If the show had been closed, Wilson Sikorsky would have become financially bankrupt. He would have had to sell his studio to Darius Jamshidi. Wilson was also having an affair with Monica, and thus, to save himself from bankruptcy and scandal, he killed Monica in anger.Sikorsky's show got a lot of free publicity after Monica's death. He decided to reap the benefits and hired controversial Charlie and popular Fontella Davis to handle Alastair's case. No one believed that Charlie would solve the case, but fortunately he did.Charlie was threatened by a lawyer named Warren Gomes, hired by Darius Jamshidi. Warren found out about Wilson Sikorsky's affair with Monica Pinch and started blackmailing him. To shut Warren's mouth, Sikorsky bribed him with his Gadokey skeleton watch. But when Warren asked for more, Sikorsky killed him.At the end of Last Looks, Charlie confronted Sikorsky with the truth. The two men played football while exchanging facts. During the exchange, Charlie revealed that he was 98 percent sure that Sikorsky attacked Monica with the Regis trophy, but he just wanted to make sure that Sikorsky was lefty. The autopsy report confirmed that a strong lefty attacked Monica that night, and this evidence was enough to arrest Sikorsky. However, after entering the cop's car, Sikorsky cunningly gives cops the slip, and gets away driving the cop car.Charlies gives chase on his bike and finally confronts Sikorsky in the sets of Johnnie's Bench, where Sikorsky tried to smash Charlie's head with a production light. But thankfully, Don Q saved Charlie's life and shot Sikorsky.Don Q saved Charlie because he wanted back the memory stick that Lorena stole from him. He revealed that a memory stick contained a poem that Don Q wrote for his daughter, Elsie, to save her from the world of crime. Charlie promised to return the memory drive on the condition that Don Q would allow Lorena to come back to the city. Don Q wanted Charlie to arrange a seat at a private school for Elsie. Well, Charlie had one school in mind, and with Alastair on his side, it was easy for Charlie to get Elsie a proper education.Hence, in the end, Alastair left alcohol and became sober for his daughter, while Lorena returned to Hollywood and was reunited with Charlie. The two romantics chased their ""unfinished business"" and sparked their relationship again.

After Henry and Wyatt find a lost horse with blood on the saddle, Henry goes to investigate and finds a near-dead man named Curry. Seeing that the man has a gunshot wound, a revolver and a satchel full of cash, he is hesitant at first, but decides to help Curry. He covers their tracks and brings Curry back to the farm, treating his injuries and removing the bullet. Henry uses the surgery as a chance to interrogate Curry, who claims to be a lawman and the sole survivor of a posse that confronted a gang of dangerous outlaws.Henry ties him up and goes to fetch a doctor, and in the meantime Wyatt sneaks into Henry's room and finds his cache of documents, as well as a fine revolver and some bullets. Wyatt takes Curry's gun and goes target shooting outside, allowing Curry to escape his bonds. Curry overpowers Wyatt, but Henry returns just in time to intervene and ties Curry up again. Henry had turned back after spotting three men investigating the spot he first found Curry, narrowly escaping being caught by them after he spied on them from a wheat field nearby.Soon after, the trio, led by a man named Ketchum, come to the farm in search of Curry. They claim to be lawmen from Woods County and that Curry is the outlaw, but arouse Henry's suspicions when Ketchum begins asking questions about Henry's own identity and family. Henry does not give up Curry, and the men leave after a tense standoff. That evening, Henry has a conversation with Curry in which Curry reveals detailed knowledge of people known to Henry, which leads Henry to trust his claims and undo some of his restraints. Curry then tells Henry about his experience as a young ranch hand who witnessed the death of Billy the Kid. The house is suddenly attacked by Duggan, one of Ketchum's men. After a game of cat-and-mouse in which Duggan crawls underneath the house to ambush them, Henry rousts him out with a shotgun and then strangles him in the mud as Wyatt watches.The next morning, Ketchum returns with the rest of his gang, greatly outnumbering Curry, Henry and Wyatt. Curry encourages Henry to surrender and turn him over, telling Henry that it is hopeless and that they should not die for his sake. However, Ketchum has captured Henry's brother-in-law Al and, when Henry refuses to surrender, shoots him in cold blood. Wyatt emerges, enraged, and opens fire, and he and Henry manage to duck back into the house. Henry goes into his room and retrieves his expensive gear, saying ""Keep your damn head down, you'll be alright"" to Wyatt. Curry recognizes the phrase as something Billy the Kid said to him when he was a young boy, and realizes that Henry is in fact Billy the Kid, who faked his own death with the help of Pat Garrett.Henry pretends to surrender, and then draws his revolver and shoots Ketchum in the face, killing several other outlaws before diving back into the house and slipping out of the back door. Whilst Curry and Wyatt hold off the remaining gang members, Henry stealthily eliminates several more until only Stilwell, the gang's tracker, is left. Stilwell pretends to surrender but tries to kill Henry with a throwing knife and is shot through the eye.Henry suddenly comes under fire as Ketchum emerges, revealing that the shot to his face only mangled his cheek. They engage in a running battle in which both men are wounded, but eventually Ketchum runs out of bullets and Henry shoots him in the head. Returning to the house, Henry is about to bandage up the injured Curry when he spots a brand on Curry's arm. Curry shoots Henry in the stomach, admitting that he was a lawman but was corrupt and allied with Ketchum. He had attempted to betray Ketchum after realizing the outlaws were going to kill him once his usefulness had run out. Curry apologizes to Henry for bringing all of this violence to his farm, but then boasts that he will get to be the man who killed Billy the Kid.Wyatt overhears all this as he is fetching his father's shotgun, and he kills Curry from the doorway before Curry can execute Henry. Wyatt tries to help his father, but Henry tells him that it is too late. Henry speaks earnestly to his son, telling him that the world is changing and Henry has no place in it anymore but that he hoped his son, who raising him had given his life some meaning, would now find a place for himself in it. He dies in Wyatt's arms. Wyatt buries his father next to his mother and leaves the farm along with the cash, two horses, and their few possessions.

This causes her to react with violent rage at even the slightest transgression because her body has an unusually high level of Cortisol, which in turn makes her stronger and faster than normal. Her parents eventually have her institutionalized due to her violent tendencies. After they fail to control her, the organization puts Lindy in the army, but they are also unsuccessful at controlling her rage. Finally, Lindy is subjected to an experimental (but effective) treatment to control her rage; a form of self-administered shock treatment given through an electrode-lined vest she must wear at all times, allowing her to live a normal life.Some time later, Lindy is prompted to go on a date by her therapist (and the vest designer), Dr. Ivan Munchin (Stanley Tucci). Munchin believes that, believing this will test if she is able to have a healthy, normal relationship with someone. Eventually, Lindy decides to go on a date with an accountant named Justin (Jai Courtney). While on the date, Lindy beats their waitress (who was giving a hard time to Justin, just because he had allergies to nuts (and almost everything on the menu had nuts)) and leaves, returning to Dr. Munchin to have her electroshock remote fixed. Munchin reveals that there is nothing wrong with the remote; she has merely built up a tolerance to the electricity and ups the dosage. Dr Munchin tells Lindy that she likes the guy and encourages her to go on a date again, and have a real relationship.Lindy contacts Justin to go on a second date. They discuss their past (Lindy was a bouncer) as well as Justin's job. Justin reveals that he only has one client; a man named Barry. They go back to Lindy's apartment and start to have sex. Justin sees Lindy's voltage therapy vest and electrodes all over her body, but he tells her it is not a big deal, and begins taking her vest off.The next morning, Justin gets Lindy a gift along with breakfast in bed. Lindy opens the gift to see a camera, bought by Justin due to her mentioning that she likes to take pictures of people. Justin asks her to explain her voltage therapy. After explaining her condition, Justin appears to accept it. Justin then leaves for work and invites Lindy over for dinner later. Lindy visits Dr. Munchin to tell him that his theory worked and that she likes Justin a lot. Munchin insists that they have a session to deal with these feelings, but Lindy leaves to take pictures with the camera Justin gave her.
Later on, Lindy calls Justin's phone after not hearing from him all day and a Detective Vicars (Bobby Cannavale) answers. She goes to the police station to sit with Detective Vicars and Detective Nevins (Laverne Cox) and they state that Justin was murdered.Lindy replays her time with Justin and begins to spiral, shocking herself repeatedly with the vest. She visits Munchin, claiming that the vest is not working, so he gives her a sedative. Once she comes to she says she needs to find out who murdered Justin. He tells her to let it go before it changes her irreversibly. Lindy then calls the detectives claiming to have more details about Justin's murder, as a ploy to get them out of the precinct so as to gain access to the evidence room from Justin's murder.
Lindy then heads to Justin's house and finds his phone. She is called by Detective Vicars who tells her that they found her and that Detective Nevins is on the way to arrest her. After a brief encounter with Nevins (Nevins tries to shoot Lindy, but Lindy distracts her and escapes), Lindy takes Justin's car and after a brief car chase in which Vicars is injured, she escapes.
Lindy goes to an electronics store to talk to someone about hacking Justin's phone and meets Andi, a female hacker (a little girl) working in the store. Andi is able to locate Justin's client, Barry Kasparzki, a notorious gangster who was confirmed to be the last person in contact with him.Upon finding out that Barry is in an abandoned building overseeing an underground fight, Lindy goes to that fight and demands that Barry tell her who killed Justin. He agrees, on the condition that she fight his top three guys all at once. Upon winning however, Barry tries to get her killed. But, Lindy manages to incapacitate both Barry and the gunman and gets him to tells her who killed Justin after threatening him with jumper cables.
Barry tells her that a billionaire recluse named Gareth Fizel (David Bradley) (And Barry's boss) had Justin killed; she electrocutes him with the jumper cables anyway. Lindy visits Detective Vicars, now in the hospital after their car chase earlier, and asks him about Fizel (Vicars tells her Fizel's location as he is convinced that Lindy cared for Justin). However, Detective Nevins interrupts them and chases Lindy to the maternity ward, where Lindy begins throwing infants at Nevins to slow her down.Lindy makes her way to Gareth's building where his head of security, Delacroix (Ori Pfeffer), knocks her unconscious. She awakens in a white room, zip-tied to a chair. Delacroix has also removed her vest. After threatening to kill her, Delacroix puts Lindy in a car back to her apartment and keeps the electroshock vest. Back at Fizel's building, Fizel tells Delacroix to get rid of Lindy (after he hears that Lindy was asking for Justin and suspects that Fizel killed him). Back in the car, Lindy tells the driver to let her out of the car, but he does not comply, so she grabs him and begins to choke him causing him to crash.
Lindy then goes to Dr. Munchin to get a new vest and returns to her apartment. She notices the 9 sign on her door has been moved, showing that someone was there, so she sneaks in her window and notices that Fizel's men have rigged an explosive device to the doorway. She then disarms the explosive and pockets it for future use. She leaves, sees Detective Vicars outside her apartment, and gets in his car. She tells him he cannot arrest her because of her condition and he would be safer not to. He explains he will go easy on her because she is different and that it has nothing to do with what Nevins says about her being a woman. Her apartment blows up and she leaves.She finds Fizel (she is captured by Delacroix when she tries to climb into Fizel's building); he tells her he is sorry that he killed Justin. He says he is glad he was able to see her before Delacroix hits her in the head again and she is back in the drainage room. He asks her if she knows what Exsanguinate means (Drainage of one's blood) and then explains it while doing it to her. She breaks free and fights him. She turns to ask how to get to Fizel before hurting Delacroix. She then fights off a few guards. After using Delacroix's finger to access Fizel's lair, Lindy learns that Justin isn't dead but in fact Justin used her as a decoy so he himself could kill Fizel (Justin works for the CIA and could not touch Fizel officially and hence used Lindy to get close to him).
Justin tells her Dr. Mucnhin had something to do with everything (CIA funds his experiments) and that she was only an experiment. She goes after him and he detonates her voltage electrodes (he has the remote and he has increased the voltages). The vest becomes ineffective because she is highly upset. Lindy throws him a bag that has the bomb in it, blowing up Fizel's entire lair as she rides the elevator down.Lindy waits for Dr. Munchin in his office ready to kill him for betraying her. Just as she decides against it and handcuffs him, Detectives Vicars and Nevins enter the office to arrest Dr. Munchin on various charges. Lindy returns to her apartment and a woman (Susan Sarandon), one of the doctors from Lindy's past, tells her that by embracing her rage she will truly become powerful. The woman then presses the voltage detonator.",A bouncer with a slightly murderous anger-management problem that she controls with the help of an electrode-lined vest she uses to shock herself back to normalcy whenever she gets homicidal.

When Rafo steals his wallet and shares his desire to spend time with his father, Mike agrees to drive him to the border. During the drive there, the pair share stories about their lives, including how Leta's henchmen used to abuse Rafo (Leta brings strange men home every day.

When they first met, they were adventurous and said yes to everything. Once they had their kids, however, they felt they needed to say no to protect them.
Carlos works at a tech firm, where he deals with young adults working with new tech all the time. His job is to make sure that the company is not sued by exaggerated claims and hence he says No a lot at work.. Allison was head of Marketing at a big company, but now she cant get a job as most employers want an entitled millennial, whom they can work till 10pm every night..One evening, they are called into a parent-teacher conference at school where they discover Katie and Nando have both submitted school work calling their mom a dictator. Allison expresses frustration that her kids perceive her this way and tells Carlos that she feels he makes her play the role of ""bad cop"" with their children. Mr. Deacon (Nat Faxon), a school employee and father, overhears and shares with them that he maintains order in his house by having a 'yes day' from time to time: one 24-hour period wherein the parents cannot say no, within reason.Carlos and Allison present the idea to the kids, telling them that if they don't get into trouble, do their chores and keep their grades up, they can have a yes day as a reward. Katie makes a wager with Allison that if her mom makes it through yes day, Katie will go to the music festival Fleekfest with her mother. If she doesn't make it, Katie will be allowed to go with a friend, Layla (Megan Stott).
The kids eventually manage to earn a yes day and put together a list of five activities for the day. First, Ellie dresses her parents in crazy outfits. Next, they go and order a massive $40 sundae that is free if they can eat it all in 30 minutes (The kids get grossed out, but Carlos wins the challenge for the family). They then go through a car wash with the windows down.
Next, they go to a capture the flag competition, where each family member leads a group (Nando had gathered a crowd by advertising that a casting director (Allison) is looking for participants for a new reality based romance show) and the goal is for one team to catch the others, throwing balloons filled with Kool-Aid at their opponents. Allison wins the game for her team (she does somersaults and does extreme athleticism), impressing her kids.
Carlos has a work emergency and calls office (when it is against the rules). Ellie sees him and makes him put a crow baby back into her nest in exchange for not telling on him. But a flock of crows attack Carlos (as they think he is stealing a baby), and he is taken to the emergency room. Carlos wants to drop out, but Allison figures that its because of work. Allison is sick of being the bad cop of the house and wants Carlos to inform the kids himself. But Carlos cant disappoint the kids and the day continues.The fourth event is a trip to a theme park, where the family ride roller coasters. When Katie steps away, Allison sees texts on her daughter's phone from Layla indicating she and Katie will be hanging out with older boys at Fleekfest. Allison tells her that the wager is off and she's going to Fleekfest with her, not Layla. Hurt, Katie storms off.
In an attempt to win a pink gorilla for Katie as an apology, Allison and Carlos get into a fight with another park-goer (the other park-goer also wanted to win the same gorilla and claims that she won it, when actually Allison won it by a whisker. They both get into a physical brawl) and are arrested. The children sneak away from the custody of the police officer at the station by telling him that their parents are waiting outside in their car. Katie goes to Fleekfest with Layla, but quickly becomes uncomfortable being alone with older boys, and her friend abandons her.
Police look at the footage from the park and find that Allison did win the gorilla and let Allison and Carlos off. They realize the police let the kids go by themselves. Allison heads to the concert and Carlos heads to the house for the ""main event""..Nando stages a ""nerd party"" at the house as the final big event, but it quickly gets out of control (kids eating sugar, breaking lamps, spilling soda all over the house) when Ellie accidentally sets off a foam explosion inside the house that was meant for the back yard. Meanwhile, Katie's phone dies while trying to contact her siblings and she panics. With help from H.E.R. (H.E.R.) (Allison wanted to get upstage to call for Katie and went backstage.. where she meets H.E.R. who was looking for a sewing kit to sew her torn dress), who is performing at the event, Allison finds Katie (HER gives Allison 2 mins on stage to find Katie) and they reconcile. H.E.R. is moved and invites them onstage for a song.
Carlos arrives home and finally manages to be a disciplinarian, forcing the party to stop and the kids to help with the cleanup. As yes day draws to a close, Ellie makes one final request. They all spend the night playing games as a family in a tent in the back yard.In a mid-credits scene, the Torres family drives to Mr. Deacon's house and pelt him with Kool-Aid balloons, as revenge for him suggesting Yes Day in the first place.",A mom and dad who usually say no decide to say yes to their kids' wildest requests with a few ground rules on a whirlwind day of fun and adventure.

He is approached by FBI Special Agent Roy Mitchell, who offers to have O'Neal's charges dropped if he works undercover for the bureau. O'Neal is assigned to infiltrate the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party (BPP) and its leader, Fred Hampton.O'Neal begins to grow close to Hampton, who works to form alliances with rival gangs and militia groups while extending community outreach through the BPP's Free Breakfast for Children Program. Hampton's persuasive oratory skills eventually help to form the multiracial Rainbow Coalition. Hampton also falls in love with Deborah Johnson, a fellow BPP member. O'Neal begins to relay intel to Mitchell, who in return compensates him with money. When a fugitive Party member, George Sams, hides out at the local BPP office, O'Neal learns from Mitchell that Sams is an informant whose presence in BPP offices allows the bureau to obtain search warrants.After Hampton is arrested and imprisoned, O'Neal begins to rise through the ranks and is promoted to security captain. When a shootout between the Chicago Police and the BPP occurs at the chapter office, O'Neal sneaks out as the office is bombed by the police. Afterward, O'Neal attempts to quit being an informant but is rejected by Mitchell.After Hampton is released from prison while appealing his charges, he reunites with Deborah, now pregnant with his child. A BPP member, Jimmy Palmer, who was hospitalized after being shot by a police officer, is killed while being transferred to another hospital. Enraged upon learning of Jimmy's death, fellow member Jake Winters engages in a shootout with police, killing several officers before being gunned down himself.After Hampton's appeal was rejected, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover orders Hampton be ""neutralized"" before he returns to prison. Mitchell corners O'Neal into helping with the plan by warning him that the BPP will retaliate against him if they find out he's an informant, and O'Neal reluctantly agrees to help. O'Neal is later handed a vial of sedatives and ordered to drug Hampton's drink with it. The next evening, BPP members gather at Hampton's apartment before he departs for prison. An allied gang leader offers Hampton money for him to flee the country with, but he turns it down and instead orders a trust to be established with the money under Jake's name. As the evening progresses, O'Neal reluctantly drugs Hampton's drink and departs soon after. Hours later, officers and agents raid the apartment and shoot Hampton dead. Later, O'Neal meets with Mitchell, who gives him money and a pair of keys to a gas station he now owns. O'Neal attempts to quit again, but reluctantly accepts the money and keys and places them into his pocket.The film ends with archive footage of Hampton's speeches, his funeral procession, and an interview O'Neal gave in 1989. The title cards state that O'Neal continued to work as an informant within the BPP before committing suicide. A lawsuit was filed against the FBI in 1970 and 12 years later was settled for $1.85 million. Today, Fred Hampton Jr. and his mother serve as chairman and board member of the Black Panther Party Cubs.","Offered a plea deal by the FBI, William O'Neal infiltrates the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party to gather intelligence on Chairman Fred Hampton."

Jim attempts to report them to Border Patrol, but Mauricio and two other men step out of their vehicle. After realizing that they are a threat, Jim tries to have Rosa and Miguel hide, so Mauricio's guys begin to open fire. Jim returns fire and hits Mauricio's brother, killing him. He gets Rosa and Miguel in the truck and starts to drive away as Mauricio chases the vehicle on foot. Jim shakes him off and gets away. Mauricio then makes a call to reinforcements.After they get far enough, Miguel sees that Rosa was shot. Jim takes her out and lays her down as she is dying. She gives Jim a bag of stolen money and an address, requesting to Jim that he take Miguel to family in Chicago. Jim then waits as medics and other officers arrive to retrieve Miguel. He is told by another officer that Miguel blames Jim for his mother's death.When Jim sees the money in Rosa's bag, he feels compelled to return for the boy. He learns from someone at the station that Miguel will be deported and go back with a family member, but Jim also sees Mauricio and his men waiting in a van outside.

The trooper claims to want to talk to Miguel, but Jim notices the man talking on the phone to someone else.

Hernandez, who is Norman's only connection with society, convinces a reluctant Norman to let her take Phoenix with her to run errands in town, so that she can have some time out of the house. While running errands together, Hernandez stops at a gas station to refuel. Phoenix is ambushed by a gang member in the gas station's bathroom. However, Shadow scares the man away, but he gives the order to the gang to follow Phoenix back home.After dropping off Phoenix, Hernandez is ambushed and killed by the gang, who proceed to head to Norman's house.

Norman, who suspects something happened to Shadow since his food bowl is still full, goes outside to look for him, while the gang silently breaks into the house to kidnap Phoenix. Norman finds Shadow dead from a bullet wound. Realizing that Shadow was shot, he heads back to the house to defend it. A struggle ensues between Norman and the gang members. Eventually, the gang leader Raylan (Brendan Sexton III) shows up and tells Phoenix, who is hiding with Norman, that he is her real father, confirming it by showing they both have a streak of white hair in the right side of their head.It is revealed that eight years prior, Phoenix's house burned down because a meth lab in the basement exploded.

Kelly kills all but one of the attackers before being rushed to the hospital with near-fatal wounds.Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Kelly's SEAL team leader and friend, Lt. Commander Karen Greer, meets with CIA officer Robert Ritter and Secretary of Defense Thomas Clay to discuss how the FSB discovered the SEALs' identities and review their response options.

The CIA refuses to conduct an investigation into the murders, motivating Greer to pass confidential information to Kelly.Healed from his injuries, Kelly tracks down the Russian diplomat, who issued the passports to the FSB operatives, and forces him to give up the name of the surviving assassin before killing him.

To conceal his true identity, he calls himself ""Snake Eyes"" (Henry Golding), a name inspired when his father's murderer forced him to roll a pair of weighted dice to determine his fate, killing him when he rolled double ones.Wealthy Yakuza boss Kenta Takamura (Takehiro Hira) discovers Snake Eyes in an underground fighting circuit located in Los Angeles. Kenta offers to find his father's killer if Snake Eyes will work for him, to which Snake Eyes accepts. When Snake Eyes is asked to prove his loyalty by shooting a man who betrayed Kenta's trust (Kenta accuses him of being an undercover spy), Snake Eyes refuses (Tommy had been kind and fair to Snake Eyes in Kenta's organization, unlike the rest of his troops) and instead helps the traitor escape. Tommy wants to kill Kenta and refuses to escape without killing him. Snake Eyes has to intervene multiple times to keep Tommy safe and eventually Kenta has to back off when the police arrive. Snake Eyes is stabbed in the attacks.The traitor is Kenta's cousin, Tomisaburo ""Tommy"" Arashikage (Andrew Koji). Tommy and Kenta were both in line to lead the Arashikage clan, an ancient ninja society devoted to preserving order and fighting evil. Kenta sought to kill his cousin, but failed and was banished. Kenta was therefore smuggling guns into Japan, via US, to stage a coup against the clan and Tommy was undercover to stop him.Grateful to Snake Eyes, Tommy takes him to his ninja Dojo in Tokyo, Japan and asks that he be initiated as a member. The current Clan Arashikage leader, Sen (Eri Ishida), Tommy's grandmother, agrees to let Snake Eyes undergo three trials to determine if he is worthy. Hard Master (Iko Uwais), A formidable mentor of the Arashikage clan and the uncle of Tommy. Blind Master (Peter Mensah), A blind mentor of the Arashikage clan.The clan's head of security, Akiko (Haruka Abe), does not trust Snake Eyes at first, but he wins her trust by revealing his father's murder and explains that is why there is no recorded history of him. Unbeknownst to anyone, Snake Eyes plans to betray his new allies. Tommy's attempted murder and escape is shown to have been staged by Kenta in order to get Snake Eyes close enough to steal the clan's most sacred treasure, the ""Jewel of the Sun"", which has magical powers.
Tommy tells Snake Eyes that the jewel was a gift from the Sun God and the clan is sworn never to use it, even to kill evil, and to only protect it.Snake Eyes finds himself increasingly torn between his guilt over betraying Tommy, the clan, and his overwhelming desire for revenge. He passes the first two trials with his exceptional talents. First trial is to snatch a bowl of water from Hard master's hands in combat, without spilling your own bowl of water, in 4 attempts. Snake Eyes fights and loses 3 times and then finally succeeds by simply asking Hard Master to exchange their bowls of water.The 2nd test is an illusion that brings Snake Eyes face to face with his father's killers on that night when they burnt his house down. Snake Eyes is furious and attacks but is gunned down. He is approached by his father, who tells him it was not his fault, as he was just a kid. Snake Eyes unburdens himself of the guilt of his father's death.Snake Eyes and Tommy learn that Kenta is back in Tokyo and aligning with the terrorist revolutionary organization Cobra. Snake Eyes meets Kenta again, in secret, and says he has no intention to work for terrorists. Kenta explains to Snake Eyes that he is tasked to steal the jewel on behalf of Cobra. Cobra, through their liaison, the Ana DeCobray / Baroness (Ursula Corberó), has been arming Kenta with weapons so that he can seize control of the Arashikage clan. Kenta and Baroness inform Snake Eyes that they have his father's murderer imprisoned and will release him if Snake does not secure the jewel for them.The third and final trial requires his spirit to be tested by sacred anacondas, who can sense if he is truly pure of heart. Due to Snake Eyes' secrets, the snakes attack him, but Akiko saves him from being killed. Confronted by the clan, Snake Eyes admits that he has not been entirely honest but manages to hide the true reason he is there and is expelled.
Snake Eyes later returns in secret and steals the jewel using his knowledge of the clan's temple, delivering it to Kenta. Kenta tastes the magic of the jewel and promises to hand it over to Cobra once he has destroyed the Arashikage clan.
Snake Eyes receives his reward for stealing the jewel: his father's killer, who turns out to be a Cobra agent. Having realized what his blood-lust has cost him, Snake Eyes spares the man and instead goes back to the Arashikage clan to warn them of Kenta's attack.Tommy puts aside his anger and let's Snake Eyes assist him and the clan's warriors, including Major O'Hara / Scarlett (Samara Weaving), a member of the international peacekeeping organization G.I. Joe, in fighting off Kenta's men. Baroness helps Kenta corner Sen and the clan is effectively defeated. After Kenta admits that he has no intention of handing over the jewel, the Baroness forms a temporary alliance with the Arashikage clan and Scarlett. With his men defeated, Kenta loses the jewel to Tommy, who overwhelmed with fury tries to use its power to kill Kenta. Kenta manages to escape, but Snake Eyes traps him in the anaconda pit, where the snakes devour Kenta upon sensing his evil spirit. The snakes then judge Snake Eyes to now be pure of heart for forgoing his lust for revenge, thus now being worthy of joining the clan.After the battle, Sen strips Tommy of his birthright to lead the clan for breaking his vow never to use the jewel. Blaming Snake Eyes for this, Tommy forsakes the clan and family, vowing to kill Snake Eyes should they ever meet again. Snake Eyes meets with Scarlett who, after explaining that his father was a G.I. Joe agent, offers him a chance to become a Joe.In a mid-credits scene, on a private jet leaving Japan, the Baroness recruits Tommy into Cobra, and Tommy has renamed himself ""Storm Shadow"".",A G.I. Joe spin-off centered around the character of Snake Eyes.

Attacked from behind by a figure wearing a pig mask, Boswick wakes to find himself suspended by his tongue in an active subway tunnel and is given a choice via recorded message: tear out his tongue and live, or remain until the next train arrives, killing him. Unable to escape the trap in time, Boswick is run over by the train and killed. The next day, police chief Angie Garza assigns Det. Ezekiel ""Zeke"" Banks a new partner, idealistic rookie William Schenk. Banks and Schenk investigate Boswick's death and Banks realizes this to be similar to the now deceased Jigsaw Killer.Meanwhile, a homicide detective named Fitch - who several years prior had ignored a backup call from Banks, resulting in him nearly getting killed - is abducted and placed in a trap where he must rip his fingers off to avoid electrocution in a filling water basin; he also fails to escape and dies. Some officers begin to suspect that Banks may be responsible, due to his history with Fitch. A box then arrives at the station, containing a pig puppet and a piece of Schenk's tattooed skin inside. A small vial inside the box directs the police to a butcher shop, which was previously a hobby shop that Banks and his father, retired chief Marcus Banks, would go to. Upon arriving, the team discovers a tape recorder and a skinned corpse, identified as Schenk. Deciding to track down the killer himself, Marcus travels to a warehouse, where he is abducted. Shortly afterwards, Garza is kidnapped, and placed in a trap in the precinct's cold storage where she has to sever her spinal cord on a blade to stop hot wax flowing from a pipe onto her face; she manages to successfully do it but dies of her injuries, with her body found by Banks.While chasing a lead, Banks is captured and wakes up at the warehouse, handcuffed to a pipe with a hacksaw nearby. He considers sawing off his arm, but is able to escape using a loose bobby pin. He then discovers Pete, his former partner who was fired when Banks exposed a murder he committed, chained in place. In front of him is a large glass-crushing machine, which has been modified to hurl shrapnel at him at high speed; a tape recorder explains that Banks can choose to either free him or leave him to die. Although Banks attempts to save Pete, he dies from blood loss. Moving to another room, Banks then finds Schenk, who is revealed to have faked his own death by using the skinned corpse of the thief who lured Boswick into the tunnels, and has been the copycat all along. He explains that he is actually Emerson, the son of the person Pete murdered, who was shot because he had agreed to testify against a dirty cop. He also reveals that Marcus, during his time as chief, deliberately protected corrupt officers (including Garza) in order to ""clean"" the streets of crime more efficiently.Believing that Banks can be an ally, Emerson presents him with a final test, revealing Marcus restrained in the air and slowly being drained of blood. Emerson calls 9-1-1 and claims that he is a civilian being pursued by a shooter, resulting in the dispatcher sending a SWAT team to his location. He hands Banks a revolver with a single bullet, and offers him the choice to either use the last bullet to shoot a target that will save Marcus but allow Emerson to escape, or to kill Emerson and let his father bleed to death. Banks decides to shoot the target to save Marcus, causing his restraints to loosen and lowering him to the ground, and then begins to fight Emerson. Shortly after, the SWAT team arrives and inadvertently triggers a tripwire, causing Marcus's restraints to yank him upward again. A gun is revealed to be affixed to his arm as restraints pull it upward resulting in the SWAT team killing him. Banks screams in anguish as Emerson escapes.","A criminal mastermind unleashes a twisted form of justice in Spiral, the terrifying new chapter from the book of Saw."

The crew begin to get adjusted to the habitat, getting themselves settled. Before long, the commander/pilot Marina sees some blood on the floor, looks up, unscrews a panel, discovers a stowaway (Michael), bleeding badly, who is larger than the space accommodates, and he quickly falls down on top of her, breaking her arm. Some equipment behind his body in the compartment appears damaged. The crew wonders if he stowed away intentionally, but this plot point is never answered; he claims he does not remember and someone would have had to screw the panel down from the outside after he was 'in' in any case. Zoe, the doctor, sews him up, with help from David, the scientist. The stowaway is somewhat hysterical upon regaining consciousness, having left his disabled (we never learn exactly how) sister behind alone, on Earth; as a result of his reaction, the crew decides he did not stow away on purpose. There are a few brief scenes where Michael eats with the crew and works alongside David, though he is clearly not qualified to be aboard a space ship as an astronaut.Michael is the largest person on board, and Hyperion (the NASA alternative/private space company) is not able to figure out how he got on board, nor how to fix the oxygen scrubber that was permanently damaged by the stowaway's body, he used up extra fuel and oxygen in takeoff that was not planned for, and there are NO replacement parts. Marina asks David to work on increasing his algae project, using up all the resources that were intended for his research project on Mars, to try to produce enough oxygen for even three of them to survive without the scrubber. Concurrently, Marina tries to get Hyperion to come up with a solution (besides offing Michael) and they (with all the world's best minds) can't come up with anything that would allow them to survive the journey. Zoe wants to give Michael extra time while they try to find a solution anyway, David and Marina do not, but they compromise on 10 days, and are ordered to tell Michael nothing. Frustrated at the life threatening risk Michael's presence poses to all the lives of the approved astronauts, David comes up with a lethal injection and offers it to Michael, with an explanation. But Zoe finds Michael, trembling with the injector, and stops him from doing it. She accuses David of not caring, but David (who has a wife at home) has sacrificed ALL of the raw material for his scientific mission for two years in the hope of keeping them all alive, and half of his algae died. He asks what she has done. The other half of the algae dies and there is now only enough oxygen for two people to survive. The commander orders Zoe and David to go out in space (Michael can't physically do it, for lack of training; it does look extremely difficult and something that would take a long time to learn to do well) They try to walk down long cables hooking the main spacecraft to the rocket which launched them off, in the hopes of filling tanks two tanks with remaining liquid oxygen from the launch craft. Each tank can hold liquid oxygen for one person for the whole trip. Zoe succeeds in filling the first tank, and is working on the second tank, but SOLAR STORM! They have to rush back or die from radiation. They rush back and the first tank, which is in no way tethered to Zoe flies off into space just as Zoe and David make it back aboard. The oxygen tank on the launch craft is leaking and Marina says the solar storm will last five hours. Zoe volunteers to go back and fill the second tank. If she succeeds she can save the three remaining astronauts, as she would die due to the radiation. She makes it down, fills it up, brings it back up, then dies of solar radiation..",A three-person crew on a mission to Mars faces an impossible choice when an unplanned passenger jeopardizes the lives of everyone on board.

After reconciling, Cameron invites Allyson in joining him and his father to hunt down Michael, to which Allyson agrees to avenge her father.

At the airport, Elias befriends a man named Farid, while his mother takes medicine that causes her severe discomfort.As the passengers settle down for the evening, a group of men, including the co-pilot Bastian, discreetly murder the three air marshals on the plane and sabotage the black box, preventing the plane from being tracked on radar. Their leader, Berg, then makes an announcement to the passengers that he and his men are now in control of the plane and expect everyone to stay put until a ransom is paid. Elias tries to hide, and Nadja follows him. A sociopathic hijacker named Eightball sees them and shoots Nadja several times. Assuming she's dead, the hijackers begin the second stage of their plan, forcing Farid to record a statement that makes it appear the plane has been seized by terrorists for a suicide attack, knowing it will then be shot down.As Nadja slowly regains consciousness, she begins to relive the day her husband, Nikolai, was killed. He had gone to a local farmhouse for help when their car broke down during a family trip but failed to return. When Nadja went looking for him, she was attacked by his murderer, a vampire who managed to bite Nadja before being burned to death by the sunrise. Nadja soon turned into a vampire, and went back to the farmhouse looking for answers. She ran into an elderly vampire who tried to shoot her for killing his son, but she overpowered and beat him to death before escaping with vials of vampire suppressant and burning the farmhouse to the ground.Nadja manages to access the cargo hold, and removes the contacts and dentures that conceal her mutated eyes and fangs before killing and feeding on a dog. A hijacker catches her in the act and she kills him and drinks his blood, which fully transforms her into a vampire. She finds Farid and they manage to regain control of the plane just as the hijackers are about to parachute out. Berg tries to take back control of the cockpit before Nadja surprises and bites him. She then stabs him with a knife before he can fully transform.The hijackers, realizing what they're dealing with, task Eightball with killing Nadja. He subdues her with UV light before extracting some of her blood, but just as he is about to stake her, Elias confronts him with Berg's gun and accidentally shoots out a window and depressurizes the plane. The hijackers take back the cockpit and restore the pressure. Eightball flees into the cargo hold and injects himself with Nadja's blood; she tries to set him on fire but fails to fully destroy him. Soon enough, the other hijackers, with the exception of Bastian, are ambushed and killed by a vampiric Eightball, while the rest of the passengers arm themselves. Nadja convinces them that she wants to help, and they manage to lock Eightball in the hold and secure the plane.Bastian informs Nadja that the plane doesn't have enough fuel to reach New York, and that they must land soon or crash. A selfish passenger dying from an injury releases Eightball in the hopes of being bitten; instead, he kills him and proceeds to turn most of the other passengers into vampires. Nadja, knowing that they will escape if the plane lands, decides to sacrifice herself by using the hijackers' explosives to kill them. Elias stops her and goes himself, but only manages to grab the detonator before being surrounded by vampires. Nadja makes Farid promise to look after him before killing and feeding on Bastian.

Her husband, the survival expert Ray Cooper (Jason Momoa), is told that a potentially life-saving drug (a generic version of a cancer drug from BioPrime) for Amanda was pulled off the market days before her treatment was set to begin, due to BioPrime CEO Simon Keeley (Justin Bartha) paying the manufacturer to delay production. Watching Keeley on a live debate with Congresswoman Diana Morgan (Amy Brenneman) (Diana was debating against the licensing practices of big Pharma that make drugs very expensive and out of reach for patients), Ray calls in and threatens Keeley, saying if he doesn't reverse his decision, he'll kill him. Keeley doesn't take the threat seriously and Amanda passes away soon after, devastating Ray and their daughter, Rachel (Isabela Merced). Ray was training Rachel as a survival expert and was also teaching her boxing and self-defense.Six months later, Ray receives a call from a journalist, Martin Bennett (Nelson Franklin), who tells him that he has evidence of criminal activity committed by BioPrime. They meet on a subway, unknowingly followed by Rachel and a hit-man named Santos (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo). Bennett explains that BioPrime has been bribing anyone who questions their dirty deeds, but before he can share his information, Santos stabs him dead. As the train stops at a station, Santos stabs Ray and knocks out Rachel, leaving them both on the platform for dead.Two years later, Ray has been obsessively tracking Keeley's movements. Ray poses as a waiter to infiltrate BioPrime's charity auction (To announce the strategic partnership between BioPrime and US Govt for cancer cure drugs, to cap the cost of treatment) so he can interrogate Keeley. Keeley says he knows nothing and tells him to go after BioPrime's chairman, Vinod Shah (Raza Jaffrey) (Keeley says that Vinod hired him, and nothing happens without his explicit sign off). After a brutal fight that leaves one of Keeley's bodyguards dead, Ray strangles Keeley to death with a plastic bag.Ray then gets Rachel, and they hide in a motel outside of town (they leave the US and enter Canada). Rachel, concerned that her father has gone too far, contacts FBI Agent Sarah Meeker (Lex Scott Davis) and tries to convince her to look into BioPrime.
The next morning, two mercenaries break into the motel and Ray kills them both, resulting in further tension between him and Rachel. Ray plans to go after Shah and lets Rachel help him trap Shah. Rachel uses a disposable cell phone to keep in touch with Meeker and provide her regular updates on whats happening with them.Ray plans an elaborate plan to separate Vinod from his entourage, while he is driving back home through an abandoned stretch of the woods. Ray succeeds, but Vinod's car is then attacked by Santos.
Ray tries to interrogate him (to find out who the bribes were paid to), but Shah refuses to talk and is soon killed by Santos. Ray and Rachel manage to escape, but later meet with Santos in a diner, and after Santos admits that he finds himself sympathetic to Ray's cause, he reveals that Morgan is his real employer (they don't attack each other due to the presence of cops). He also tells Rachel that they will meet again soon.Returning to the city, Ray is ambushed by the FBI (who got reports of a stolen tow truck near where Vinod was killed and tracks it back entering the city) and flees to the roof of a baseball stadium. As Meeker tries to talk him down, it's revealed that ""Ray"" is actually Rachel. Ray died from his wounds at the subway and Rachel, suffering from PTSD and a fugue state, devoted herself to finishing his quest for vengeance.

Hartmann insists they visit him in Munich to experience the ""New Germany"".Six years later, Legat works as British prime minister Neville Chamberlain's (Jeremy Irons) secretary as Europe is on the brink of war. He is married to Pamela Legat (Jessica Brown Findlay). Chamberlain strives to obtain peace with Adolf Hitler (Ulrich Matthes) at any cost, even if that means allowing Germany to seize control of the Sudetenland from Britain's ally Czechoslovakia. But Chamberlain's talks with Hitler break down and Hilter plans to invade Sudetenland the very next day. Hugh works for his boss Sir Osmund Cleverly (Mark Lewis Jones), under the office of the PMO.
Chamberlain remembers from a speech given by Hitler that he considers Mussolini as his friend. Chamberlain believes it is his duty to do absolutely everything in his power to avoid war.
Chamberlain writes to Benito Mussolini in an effort to halt military action; it seemingly works (at the very last minute Chamberlain receives word (while he was addressing the house) that Mussolini has intervened) and Hitler agrees, inviting Chamberlain and French prime minister Édouard Daladier to Munich for a conference.Hartmann meanwhile works as a translator in the Foreign Office in Berlin while secretly plotting with a Wehrmacht general in an effort to overthrow Hitler if top army officials agree to arrest him and seize control. The general believes this cannot be accomplished unless Hitler is allowed to invade the Sudetenland, while Hartmann doubts the collective resolve of the generals.
Now with the conference, Hartmann is sure that Chamberlain will sacrifice Sudentenland to prevent war. Hitler would not need to invade and thus he would not be arrested.
Hartmann is given a stolen document by his lover, Helen Winter (Sandra Hüller), that indicates Hitler intends to conquer Europe. Hartmann and the others reconvene and agree that getting the information to Chamberlain while he is in Munich is their best option (so Chamberlain doesn't make the deal and Hitler is forced to invade); Hartmann reveals he has a trusted former classmate, Legat, who can likely help. Legat is approached by Sir Horace Wilson (Alex Jennings) and a top MI6 official regarding the document in Hartmann's possession and agrees to help obtain it despite the dangers associated with espionage.Legat remembers how Hartmann was rabidly pro-Hitler when he visited him in Munich few yrs ago.
Legat convinces Chamberlain to bring him with to Munich under the guise of being a translator. Hartmann boards Hitler's train to Munich and hides the document and a pistol in the bathroom, soon discovering his roommate is a childhood friend named Franz Sauer (August Diehl), who has become a Schutzstaffel officer. Sauer becomes suspicious of Hartmann, who catches him rummaging through his suitcase in the train. Hartmann meets with Hitler, who chastises him for his Oxford education.In Munich, Legat and Hartmann reunite, a flashback reveals they had a falling out in 1932 after a heated verbal argument related to Hartmann's then-support of Nazism. Legat agrees to take possession of the document, but insists Hartmann himself present the argument to Chamberlain that he should not sign the Munich Agreement. Legat and Hartmann meet with Chamberlain, who scoffs at the idea of not signing the agreement based on vague German military plans for a coup and refuses to take action. Chamberlain signs the agreement with Hitler shortly thereafter. Legat promises Hartmann to take the document to London and continue to press the issue.
Later that night, Hartmann takes Legat to a local nursing home to see Lena, revealing that in 1935 she attended an anti-Nazi rally, only to have a Star of David carved in her back and thrown from a window after she was found to be Jewish, resulting in paralysis and an inability to speak.
Hartmann reveals he intends to assassinate Hitler much to Legat's dismay. When Legat returns to his hotel, he finds his room has been ransacked by Franz (who had seen Legat meet Hartmann at a local pub and had started tailing him) who attacks him. Legat discovers the document is gone and panics, but he is able to get a discreet message to Hartmann informing him.
Meanwhile Chamberlain asks Hitler to sign a document of peace between Britain and Germany, which Hitler does. Chamberlain considers this as a great victory.
Hartmann meets with Hitler to deliver the morning news reports but cannot bring himself to shoot him.As Legat enters the car bound for the airport, typist Joan Menzies (Anjli Mohindra) reveals she is the niece of a British army colonel (assigned to keep a watch out Legat), and that she took possession of the document to prevent Sauer from finding it. Chamberlain returns to Britain a hero and gives his famous Peace for our time speech. Legat returns home to his wife and son, revealing that with the war coming, he plans to quit his job and join the RAF. The Munich Agreement ultimately fails and World War II begins just one year later. Chamberlain resigns in disgrace before dying soon after. The document, however, prompts the British to prepare for and ultimately win the war.","A British diplomat travels to Munich in the run-up to World War II, where a former classmate of his from Oxford is also en route, but is working for the German government."

During surgery, an army surgeon discovers and removes an additional fourth bullet made of silver and not of German design.Thirty-five years earlier, in rural France, brutal land baron Seamus Laurent leads a slaughter of a Romani clan who have settled upon his land and made a disputed claim to it. Having foreseen their impending danger, the elderly Romani leader cast a set of silver dentures in the form of a wolf's fangs for their protection. After the slaughter, the clan leader and a male Romani are captured, the latter being dismembered and erected as a scarecrow to serve as a warning to other Romani, whilst the Romani leader is buried alive with the silver fangs clutched in her grasp.Soon after, the townspeople, including Seamus' children Edward and Charlotte, are plagued by nightmares of the scarecrow and the silver fangs. While playing one day, farm boy Timmy reveals to the other children he knows the location of the scarecrow. Upon arriving at the scarecrow and having sworn the others to secrecy, Timmy is overcome with the urge to dig up the silver fangs. Edward attempts to stop him, but Timmy becomes possessed and places the fangs in his mouth, subsequently biting Edward's throat as the other children flee in terror. Seamus quickly recovers the wounded Edward whilst Timmy is nowhere to be found. A doctor concludes that Edward was attacked by a wild animal, as Edward grows ill. After Charlotte awakes to Edward's screams during the night and finds him ensnared by wood-like vines emerging from his body, Edward disappears into the night.Charlotte goes to the local church to pray and encounters Timmy, who claims he has no memory of what happened after donning the fangs. When Charlotte asks Timmy what he did with the silver fangs, he reveals he hid them in the church. When Charlotte's maid Anais discovers them, Timmy flees. As Timmy runs into the forest, he is pursued by an unseen beast into an abandoned shack where he is soon slaughtered. Widowed pathologist John McBride visits the town, seeking information on the traveling Roma. He accompanies police lieutenant Alfred Molière, who has been called by Seamus to find Edward. Meeting with Seamus, the pair find Timmy's mauled body. Molière, believing Edward's disappearance means he has likely been killed, departs, but John offers to stay to assist Seamus. That night, Seamus' manor is visited by a strange wolf-like beast that unsuccessfully tries to gain entry.The next day, three townspeople are attacked by the beast. Two are killed but the third, Anne-Marie, is critically maimed and manages to return to the town. Upon hearing Anne-Marie survived her attack but was bitten, John rapidly heads to the town, but is too late to prevent an already transforming Anne-Marie from escaping. Luring the Anne-Marie beast, John manages to trap and kill the creature, bringing the corpse to Seamus and performing an autopsy. Cutting open the creature reveals Anne-Marie, screaming in a murderous rage. John insists that she cannot be saved and orders a villager to shoot and kill her. John explains that the infection causes a victim to become one of the creatures, with Seamus realising that Edward has suffered the same fate. John reveals to Seamus' wife Isabelle that his wife and daughter were killed by a similar beast - he was investigating the Romani as they pronounced the ""curse"" on the land had been fulfilled. Isabelle also reveals that Seamus was the orchestrator of the Romani massacre and so is the target of the curse, along with his kin.Charlotte informs John of the silver fangs' location, which he melts down into four silver bullets. The first beast attacks and bites Seamus' maid Anais, but withdraws as Seamus returns from a failed hunting party. Anais bandages and hides her wounds. John notices evidence of Anais' attack but falls into an argument with Seamus about his actions before he can pursue the maid. Seamus investigates a noise coming from Anais' room and is ambushed by a transformed Anais, knocking his candlestick over and setting the manor ablaze. Seamus successfully kills the Anais creature but not before he is bitten. Knowing that he is doomed to transform and attack his family, Seamus immolates himself in front of John. Retrieving Charlotte and Isabelle, John leads them to the church where the other townspeople have taken shelter from the attacks.During the night after everyone has fallen asleep, Isabelle goes to pray and hears Edward's voice calling to her from outside the barricaded church doors. A grief-stricken Isabelle lifts the barricade, letting the rampaging beast into the church where it proceeds to massacre the townspeople. John attempts to shoot the beast with a silver bullet, but Isabelle intentionally stands between his aim and the beast, calling out to the transformed Edward. As the raging beast mauls her, John has no other choice but to shoot through Isabelle into the beast. Both fall to the floor, and as Isabelle dies, Edward reverts to his human form. Isabelle dies embracing her weeping, reanimated human son.With both their parents dead and their manor destroyed, John takes care of Edward and Charlotte, who returns to John the three remaining silver bullets from the attack in the church. It is revealed that the mortally wounded French captain is the adult Edward, having had the silver bullet lodged inside him ever since he was shot as a creature/child in the church. With the silver bullet removed, Edward dies on the operating table. Some time later, an adult Charlotte visits an elderly bed-ridden John, returning the fourth silver bullet.

Carol is a successful chef, while Tim is a stay at home husband and cares for the kids.Tim's younger brother Ted (Alec Baldwin) (a former executive of Baby Corp, Tim's younger brother) is now a successful CEO and is never around, but sends lavish gifts to the family. Tabitha is exhibiting more grown-up behavior, and one night while Tim wonders about the person his daughter is becoming, he hears something from Tina's room. He discovers that Tina is from Baby Corp, just as Ted once was, and that she has been assigned to get Ted there for a special mission. Tim refuses to call Ted, saying that he will never come (as he cares for nothing but his work), and encourages Tina to go back to sleep. However, Tina leaves a fake voicemail for Ted (using Tim's recorded voice), luring him to the Templetons' house.The next morning, Ted arrives and Tim explains to him that Tina is a Baby Corp dispatch. Tina introduces the brothers to a new formula that will allow them to turn back into children for 48 hours in order to infiltrate Tabitha's school and figure out what Dr. Erwin Armstrong (Jeff Goldblum), founder and principal of the school, is planning behind parents' backs. Dr Erwin espouses that parents are holding their kids back and Tim believes that he is the reason why Tabitha has been growing ever more distant from him.
Tim and Ted hide from Carol and leave her a note that they are going on a brother bonding trip. This is a good cover for them to complete their mission.At the school, Tim, now as his 7-year-old self, follows Tabitha to her class while baby Ted is placed with other babies. Ted rallies the babies to help him get out of the playroom so that he can go to Armstrong's office to investigate. Tim tries to get sent to the principal's office by disrupting class, but is instead put in ""The Box"" for timeout. Ted discovers that Armstrong is actually a baby himself (and has just built a grown up body around himself), having run away from home after realizing that he was smarter than his parents and now makes money by creating popular phone apps (all of these apps are created by babies who code). His ultimate plan is to get rid of every parent on B-Day (Baby revolution day), so that they cannot tell their children what to do anymore.Tim finds that Tabitha is excelling in her class, except for music. She struggles with the notes and this is putting her performance in the upcoming holiday pageant at risk. Tim speaks to Tabitha (as her classmate Marcos Lightspeed) and understands that Tabitha wants her dad Tim to be proud of her.Tim gets invited by Carol to her house, as Tabitha's friend. There he meets his own parents Ted Templeton Sr. (Jimmy Kimmel) & Janice Templeton (Lisa Kudrow), who tell ""Marcos"" that Tim is an unreliable dad. He had a very active imagination as a kid and imagined seeing his baby brother walk and talk.
""Marcos"" helps Tabitha practice for her performance.On the night of the holiday pageant, where Tabitha is supposed to sing a solo, the brothers and Tina plan to expose Armstrong. However, they learn that B-Day is set to happen that night through Armstrong's new app, QT-Snap, which will hypnotize the parents into mindless zombies. Tina tries to organize Ted to try and turn off the master power switch, that will stop the app upload. Tim stops Ted, since Tabitha is due to perform shortly. Both Tim and Ted are caught by Armstrong's ninja babies and are put in The Box, which slowly starts to fill with water. Tabitha sings her solo, but when she sees that Tim has not showed up, she runs off the stage crying. She is consoled by Tina, who reveals her identity and her mission. Tabitha agrees to help her younger sister by getting to the server and shutting down QT-Snap before it can go worldwide. Ted is able to call Precious, Tabitha's pet pony, into the school, as she breaks them out of The Box.Tim and Ted reach the server first, but they are stopped by Armstrong, who calls the zombie parents for backup. Tabitha realizes that Marcos is really Tim. While the brothers hold them back as the formula starts to wear off, Tina and Tabitha get up to the server. Tabitha is able to hack in and pull up the shutdown screen, but is interrupted by Armstrong. The sisters then set off a candy lava volcano using Mentos and soda, destroying the servers and turning all parents back to normal. Tina then reveals that bringing Tim and Ted back together was her true mission. The whole Templeton family gathers to celebrate Christmas, while Armstrong returns to his own family.","The Templeton brothers have become adults and drifted away from each other, but a new boss baby with a cutting-edge approach is about to bring them together again - and inspire a new family business."

Matilda drowns but is revived by a police officer who reveals that everything that uses electricity is malfunctioning. At the hospital, they learn that the coma patients have awoken. They return home, but Jill, Noah, and Doris are unable to sleep, and Noah says he sees shooting stars which Jill explains are satellites. On her way to work, Jill observes that the whole neighborhood is awake. There, psychiatrist Dr. Murphy explains that people appear to be no longer able to fall asleep. Thus, they will soon suffer from the symptoms of sleep deprivation. The only known exception is an old woman, who is being studied at a military base called The Hub, in the hopes of finding a cure for the condition. Jill remembers that Matilda can also fall asleep and she rushes home to find her, fearing that she will be taken to be studied/experimented on to find the cure as well, only to discover that she's at church. The pastor gives a sermon about Matilda being a beacon of hope and people want to sacrifice her. Jill and Noah arrive to get her but the churchgoers (aside from Doris and the pastor) does not want to give up Matilda. After an officer shoots and kills the doctor with Jill, the people panic and Doris is able to hide Matilda away. Jill, Matilda, and Noah flee to the woods. They rush to a garage to find a car. Jill leaves the two outside while she enters the garage. Jill takes a car after hiding from two men and picks up Noah and Matilda. Noah tells Jill that they should bring Matilda to The Hub and Jill eventually reluctantly agrees.They reach a library and Noah finds a map. Noah and Jill use the map to find out how to get to The Hub. While doing so, an escaped prisoner steals their car with Matilda in it. Other prisoners threaten Jill and Noah but they are saved by the man who stole their car, Dodge. They discover plane wreckage and Noah and Dodge look for items they might need. Jill teaches Matilda to drive because she's the only one who has the energy to and to prepare her for the possibility of living alone when everyone else has died from sleep deprivation. While driving, they are attacked by people but manage to escape.They reach The Hub. Dodge offers to stay but Jill gives him the car and tells him to leave. Jill splits up with her children and enters The Hub. She sneaks in disguised as a lab worker to find the other woman who can sleep. She finds her in very ill condition. The woman states she should have been dead months ago. Jill is convinced there is no cure so she begs the woman to raise Matilda. Jill is seen by Murphy and lies about wanting to be there to help. Jill asks if there is a cure and Murphy replies that it has been five days and there is no cure and that the lab workers have been using a drug that helps the brain function to keep them going but it is only temporary and causes neurological damage. The army confronts Jill and her children and Matilda tearfully admits she can sleep.The next day, Matilda asks if she can help and the doctor responds that they need to find out what makes her special. She sees an ape who has been experimented on and sees that the ape doesn't fall asleep when given anesthetic gas. The doctor says that chimps were the only animals besides humans that can't sleep due to their biological closeness to us. They test the gas on Matilda and she falls asleep. Jill is handcuffed in a room where she experiences delirium.Murphy asks Jill why her daughter can sleep and Jill begs Murphy to let Matilda go but she insists that humanity's survival depends on her. She explains that the sleep disorder was caused by the same solar flare that knocked out power affecting humans' (and chimps') brains. Dodge is taken as a guard and is given stimulants. The woman who can sleep goes into cardiac arrest and dies. Jill hallucinates that Noah is threatening to kill her. The real Noah is taken away to see if his brain is different than his sister's.The soldiers then go insane and begin shooting everyone. Jill goes to rescue her daughter and the two run off together. Noah is hallucinating and cuts a wire, electrocuting himself. Jill and Matilda try resuscitating him using a defibrillator but are unsuccessful. Noah suddenly wakes up the next morning, saying that he was dreaming. Noah tells Jill that she was right about not wanting to go to The Hub and that he knows she loves them and needs them. Matilda realizes the reason that she and Noah could sleep was because they had both temporarily died. They drown Jill in a lake.

In the midst of a brawl outside the casino, Murretto sucker-punches rookie police officer Valerie Young so that she will jail him and protect him from his pursuers. One of those pursuers, hitman Bob Viddick, gets himself incarcerated in the same small-town jail by pretending to be drunk and crashing a car into the police car Murretto had abandoned, which was being investigated by two state troopers.Murretto and Viddick are placed in separate cells, initially thwarting Viddick's plan to kill Murretto. However, Viddick has planted a small incendiary device at the station's entrance and when it ignites and the fire alarm goes off, he takes advantage of the confusion. Viddick beats a drunken man sharing his cell and incapacitates the police sergeant, stealing his gun. He is about to kill Murretto when Young interrupts him and returns him to his cell.While Murretto and Viddick trade threats, a new killer enters the police station-Anthony Lamb, a second hitman hired to kill Murretto. Entering the station with a bouquet of balloons as cover, he quickly murders several police officers. Young discovers the carnage and retreats behind bulletproof glass to the holding cells containing Murretto and Viddick. In a hail of bullets, one of Young's own rounds ricochets and hits her in the abdomen. Corrupt police officer Huber, who has been stealing drugs from the evidence locker and has killed the sergeant during Lamb's shooting spree, reveals his betrayal to Young and joins forces with Lamb as they attempt to break through the wall of the holding cells. Murretto explains that he was working for a Nevada casino mob boss and tried to buy off the state's attorney general William Fenton. When Fenton didn't cooperate and was brutally killed, it turned out he had recorded his conversations with Murretto. To save his own skin Murretto agreed to work with the FBI, which lead the mob boss to send hired killers after him.Murretto and Viddick appeal to Young for the keys to their cells. Murretto manages to convince Young to hand him the keys, to the dismay of Viddick. Young releases him to go after Huber and Lamb. Just as two of Young's fellow officers are shot by Lamb after they catch him and Huber trying to break through the wall, Murretto arrives on the scene and attacks Lamb and Huber. In a steam-filled shower room Lamb shoots Huber by mistake while himself being stalked by Murretto. Meanwhile Viddick shows up (having finally convinced Young to release him too), stabs Lamb and offers Murretto the chance to kill Lamb and avenge the death of his ex and son. Murretto instead shoots both Viddick and Lamb, then pours gasoline all over the room, intending to light the entire station on fire and leave the scene, revealing his true nature.Just as Murretto is about to leave he is confronted by Young, who has meanwhile attended to her gunshot wound. She threatens to put him back in his cell, but Murretto lights the place on fire. Young engages in an intense gunfight with Murretto and is finally about to shoot him, when another corrupt cop (Detective Deena Schier, the investigating officer on the Fenton case) arrives and shoots her instead. Deena is promptly shot by Viddick, who leads Young to safety outside and then escapes in a police car.While being taken away by ambulance, Young gets a radio dispatch about a stolen police vehicle from the station.

The woman is hanged from a tree and ultimately set on fire. Before she dies, however, her spirit is bound to the body of a doll.Many years later, disgraced journalist Gerry Fenn works a job reporting on all things strange and unusual. His latest assignment takes him to Boston, where the purported strange activity is revealed to be a teenage prank. As he's preparing to leave, he discovers the doll and purposely crushes it, accidentally freeing Mary's spirit. Gerry later gets into an accident as he's driving away after seeing a young girl, Alice Pagett, run across the road. He follows her to the tree from the prologue, the site where he found the doll, and hears her speak before collapsing. When he takes her to a nearby church, he learns that Alice is deaf and couldn't have spoken. Gerry decides to stay in town to investigate what he thinks could be a real story rather than a hoax or prank.The following day Alice stuns the community by speaking, proclaiming that she has been cured by the Virgin Mary. This launches a media furor that is further propelled by other seemingly miraculous healings. During the healings, a statue of the Virgin Mary near the chancel of the church cries tears of blood. The Catholic Church sends Monsignor Delgarde to investigate the claims, assisted by Bishop Gyles. Gerry befriends Alice, learning that while she has been speaking to an entity named Mary, the girl has only assumed that Mary was the Virgin Mary. Beginning to suspect that something sinister is occurring due to visions of ""Mary"" as a horrific entity, Gerry finds a partner in Father William Hagan, Alice's maternal uncle, who was healed by Alice, but also suspects the healings' true nature. Fr. Hagan discovers a book detailing Mary Elnor, a witch who performed miracles for Satan, but before he has the chance to warn anybody he is attacked by Mary and his body is found hanging in the church. Bishop Gyles convinces Gerry to keep the apparent suicide of Hagan quiet as it will tarnish the divine occurrences. His death is declared an accident.Gerry befriends Natalie Gates, the town's physician, and reveals that he was found fabricating stories which is why he now reports hoax stories, hoping this event will relaunch his career. The pair eventually comes across the information Fr. Hagan discovered, revealing Mary sold her soul to Satan in order to gain power. Satan would allow her and her descendants (one of whom is revealed to be Alice) to perform ""miracles"" prompting people to pledge themselves to her, and in turn, Satan. Mary tries to kill Gerry, but Msgr. Delgarde drives her away with prayer and his crucifix. Gerry and Delgarde are shocked to learn that Bishop Gyles was aware of the history in Banfield involving Elnor, but thought that it was not connected to the miracles that were recently occurring. He warns Gerry that any attempt to share his views on the situation will fall on deaf ears due to Gerry's tarnished reputation.Alice, who they believe is unaware of Mary's true nature, wishes to hold a church service by the tree and broadcast it to the masses. Msgr. Delgarde warns that those pledging themselves to Mary Elnor would make her stronger and condemn their soul to Hell. Msgr. Delgarde, along with Gerry and Natalie, tries to perform a ritual in the church to stop this, but Mary appears and crushes him with a burning cross.Once the service begins, Alice urges everyone to pledge themselves to Mary Elnor three times. Gerry manages to stop the crowd from fully pledging by claiming that the miracles were just more of his hoaxes, that they were all a result of the placebo effect. Natalie communicates with Alice using sign language, urging her to stop the service. Mary speaks to Alice, entreating her to continue it or never speak again. Realizing Mary's true nature, Alice confirms that the miracles were not of God. The tree suddenly bursts into flames, causing all the attendants to flee in panic as an angry Mary emerges from it. She incinerates Bishop Gyles before trying to kill Gerry, but Alice sacrifices herself to save his life. This in turn causes Mary to disappear, as Alice was her link to the living world. Struck by her sacrifice, Gerry begs God to save Alice's life. She comes back to life, but is once again deaf. All the people whom Alice cured soon return to their prior state and the film concludes with a warning from Biblical verse Matthew 7:15.

Karen is quick to introduce herself to Malik; she refuses to shake his hand, makes a callous comment about not ""having any cash"" in her home, and installs a security camera in the direction of their house. Although Malik and Imani are perplexed by Karen's behavior, they decide to ignore their concerns and focus on settling in.Unbeknownst to the both of them, Karen is virulently racist, with Neo-Confederate memorabilia in her home and a reputation for abusing her power as president to target local black residents, often recruiting her equally racist policeman brother, patrolman Mike Wind (Roger Dorman), to help. She soon starts harassing and stalking Malik and Imani, trying to find something she can use to get them out of Harvey Hill. She discovers that Malik smokes marijuana and catches her son watching the couple have sex in front of an open window, but when she brings the issue up at a meeting of the Association's executive board, the other members are disturbed by her bigoted remarks about African Americans and decide not to take any action against Malik or Imani.After learning that Malik and Imani are holding a housewarming party for their friends, Karen convinces Imani that she wants to make amends and receives an invitation. At the party, she quickly offends everyone present by trying to argue that black Americans are being too ""angry"" and saying that if they don't like America, they should just ""go back"". Malik angrily kicks her out, and Karen looses her temper and rages against him and Imani. When Karen refuses to make a sincere apology for her behavior, Malik has a security camera of his own placed in the direction of her house.The next day, Karen comes across three young men, two of them black, and demands that they present her with identification. They refuse, and she calls her brother, lying that they are threatening her physically. Mike arrests them, but the men are quickly released after video footage surfaces of Karen's phone call. The Association then votes her out as president and rescinds her membership to tamp down the bad publicity.Growing more deranged and frustrated, Karen gets Mike to pull Malik over as he's driving home from work by revealing his history of marijuana use. Mike finds no marijuana in his car, so he plants a bag of weed in the trunk, resulting in Malik getting arrested and spending the night in jail. He manages to post his own bail and arrives home later that night.Karen visits Imani the next morning, telling her that she and her husband should leave the neighborhood if they don't want any more trouble. Imani defiantly responds that she and Malik won't be leaving anytime soon. That night, Mike arrives with a search warrant and arrests Malik again, while Karen cuts the power to their house and breaks in with a gun. The siblings threaten Imani at gunpoint before Karen seemingly shoots Imani dead. Mike's police partner Officer Hill rushes in, and a standoff ensues until Mike and Hill shoot each other at close range; Mike is killed while Hill is only slightly wounded. Karen prepares to finish Hill off, but a wounded but still-alive Imani grabs Mike's gun and kills Karen in self-defense.Malik is released from jail, and he and Imani receive a full apology and compensation from the city of Atlanta for what they went through.","Karen attempts to displace the new Black family that moved into the neighborhood, but they won't back down without a fight."

The police detective, Joe Finney, is skeptical of the family's story. Once the police leave, Curt, Ronald and Matt go to Matt's boss' house and retrieve the real document, which turns out to be plans for a new car part. Curt and Ronald discover they have a high bounty placed on their heads, and make plans to ascertain what the document is worth by arranging a meeting with Frank Capelli, the mob leader who contracted the blackmail scheme and with whose wife, Vanessa, Ronald is having an affair.

Mike McCann and his brother Gurty, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD and aphasia, work for a trucking company in North Dakota until Mike punches another trucker for referring to Gurty as a ""retard"", and they are both fired. Mike hears about ice road truckers needed in Winnipeg, and they apply. Jim Goldenrod, another trucker, agrees to lead a rescue mission to deliver wellheads to the mine. He hires McCann and Gurty, along with a young woman, Tantoo. Also joining is actuary Varnay, responsible for insurance risk assessment for Katka, the company which owns the mine. $200,000 is split between the four truckers, which will be redistributed among the survivors if anyone dies. Meanwhile, the miners are communicating with Katka executives, and Katka General Manager Sickle transmits a message that they plan to free the men by blasting a tunnel.The team leaves for the mine with three wellheads. During the trip, Goldenrod's engine seizes. While attempting to repair it, the ice beneath his trailer breaks and his leg gets trapped. Knowing he can't escape, he convinces Tantoo to sever the strap attaching him to the truck, causing him to drown but saving the other two rigs and wellheads. In an attempt to flee the rapidly approaching pressure wave and cracking ice, the remaining two trucks fishtail and roll over, stopping the pressure wave.Varnay convinces Mike to accuse Tantoo of sabotaging Goldenrod's rig, but Tantoo reveals her brother Cody is amongst the miners. When they continue to interrogate her, she pulls out a pistol, but Gurty disarms her and ties her up. After the men right the trucks, Varnay locks Mike and Gurty in the back of their rig. Varnay is revealed to have been the one who sabotaged Goldenrod's rig, and knocks Tantoo unconscious. He rigs Mike's truck with dynamite and drives off with Tantoo, but Mike and Gurty escape from the trailer and throw the dynamite away just before it explodes. Varnay watches the explosion from afar, believing that Mike and Gurty are dead.While winching their trailer out of the ice, Gurty tries to warn Mike the winch will fail, but Mike starts the machine anyway. The winch snaps, causing Gurty and the trailer to fall into the water, but Mike rescues Gurty. Varnay meets with Sickle, telling him Mike and Gurty have died. Sickle instructs Varnay to get rid of Tantoo and the last remaining wellhead by making it seem Tantoo lost control and veered off a cliff. Varnay prepares to kill Tantoo, but is bitten by Gurty's pet rat Skeeter, enabling Tantoo to throw him out of the rig. Mike and Gurty arrive and kill the Katka contractors pursuing Tantoo.After Tantoo runs out of fuel due to Varnay disconnecting her fuel equalizer, he catches up to her, but Mike crashes his rig into Varnay's truck, sending it off a cliff. Varnay survives and creates an avalanche with dynamite. Mike and Gurty escape, but Tantoo is hit by snow and wounded by a branch. They uncouple her trailer, and drive off with the wellhead. Varnay pursues them in Tantoo's rig and begins ramming them. Mike boards Varnay's rig and both fall from the truck. After a struggle, Mike attempts to drive away, but Varnay climbs onto the rig. Mike knocks Varnay out, accelerates the rig, and jumps out, causing it to fall through the surface and kill Varnay. Meanwhile, Tantoo and Gurty cross a bridge not designed for the weight of the truck, and barely make it over before the bridge collapses. After crossing, the truck starts sliding backwards, and Gurty is crushed trying to prevent the truck from falling. Mike arrives and comforts a dying Gurty.

Meera is a cancer survivor, and worries that the disease may return, but Henry is very understanding and supportive.
One evening, after returning home from a date night, the couple find that their house has been broken into and the living room trashed. The only things stolen are a laptop and their cell phones (which they left behind so as not to be a distraction during their date). After a visit from a detective (who, hearing pipes rattling, suggests they need a plumber), Henry installs a security system at the house.
A few days later, Meera is woken in the night by strange noises in the house, like rattling pipes. When she tries the lights, they do not work. Henry goes outside to check the generator and finds it has been smashed. He sees flashlight beams in the windows of the house and realizes the intruders have returned. Dashing back inside, he finds Meera bound and gagged in the bedroom. He releases her and they try to escape, but are pursued by masked men. Meera manages to get to the couple's car, but then hears gunshots from inside the house. A wounded man staggers outside, followed by Henry, who shoots and kills him.
The next day, at the police station, Meera and Henry are shown mugshots of the three intruders, one of whom is still alive and in ICU at the local hospital. They were all from the Cobb family, living in a rundown trailer park on the outskirts of town. They also learn that a young woman from the same family has recently gone missing.
Meera is left extremely traumatized by these events, and also by the discovery that Henry kept a hidden gun. Henry assures her he has got rid of it, and suggests that despite what has happened, they should go ahead with the housewarming party they had intended to give. With this in mind, he drives off to buy supplies for the party. Meera notices he has left his wallet, and when she cannot reach him by phone, she decides to follow him to the store. She soon catches up with his car, but to her surprise he turns off at the hospital. Distracted by this, she collides with another vehicle.
Meera's car is taken to the body shop and she takes an Uber home. She tells Henry what happened and asks why he went to the hospital. He tells her he just took a wrong turn.
With her own car out of action, Meera borrows Henry's car to get to work. In the car park, she meets the detective in charge of the case. He tells her the surviving intruder has died, so the case is now closed. Meera also learns that the man died on the night she followed Henry to the hospital.
Now deeply suspicious, Meera looks through the GPS record on Henry's vehicle and sees the Cobb home address. She goes there and manages to enter their trailer. Inside, she finds an envelope bearing the logo of Henry's construction company, with the address written in his handwriting. Meera opens the family's mailbox and finds a package containing a video camera. A neighbor appears and confronts her, saying he saw her car there a few days before and accusing her of ""snooping"". He seizes the package and bangs it against a wall. Meera grabs the package and leaves.
Back home, she tries to play the video, but it will not work properly; she sees only the image of Dylan Cobb. She orders another camera online, arranging to have it delivered to her work address. She decides to search Henry's office and finds a USB chip with photos of the construction of their house. Dylan appears in the photos as one of the construction team. Henry arrives home and so she has to cut short her search, but later that night she studies the photos again and this time sees images of Christine, the missing girl. The next day, Meera confronts Henry; she wants to know why an envelope with his handwriting was at the Cobb trailer, why he himself had visited the trailer, why he started keeping a gun, and how come he has pictures of the missing girl on his computer. Henry explains he was short of cash to complete building the house, and he committed fraud in order to get extra cash, but intended to repay the money. Dylan Cobb had worked for him, but Henry fired him after he saw Dylan ill-treating his daughter; Dylan was enraged and swore revenge, and also threatened to expose Henry's dodgy financial dealings. Henry had been paying Dylan to keep quiet, but after he stopped paying, Dylan and the other Cobb men broke into the house.
Meera is reassured by Henry's explanation, and happiness is restored. When the new video camera arrives, she is no longer interested in looking at the film she found at the Cobb home. Finally it is the night of the housewarming party, and with the house full of guests the party is in full swing. When Meera happens to see a TV news item about the still-missing Christine Cobb, her suspicions are reawakened. She gets the new video camera and plays the tape. On it, Dylan Cobb talks about how he did not like the way Henry looked at his daughter, and that after Christine went missing, Dylan went to Henry's house with his dog, which started barking furiously in the vicinity of the office.
Meera goes to Henry's office and finds a hidden switch, which opens a secret door to a basement. Down in the basement, Christine is discovered bound to a chair, attached to pipes by chains; this is the cause of the mysterious banging noises which have occasionally been heard in the house. Meera tries to free the girl, but Henry arrives in the basement before she succeeds. He tells Meera that he has always had perverted urges, but that he did not choose to be this way. Meera finally realizes that the reason Henry built their isolated home was so he could have a secret place to keep his victims. She attempts to call 911, but Henry overpowers her and ties her up. Back upstairs, he tells their guests that Meera has had too much to drink and has gone to bed, and he sends the guests home. Meera manages to get free of her bonds and she also frees Christine. Henry comes back down to the basement while they are trying to escape, and a chase ensues. Henry knocks out Meera and drags Christine back down to the basement. There, he ties her up again and is about to kill her with a baseball bat, but instead he is fatally wounded when a revived Meera appears and smashes him in the head with a clock. Ironically it is a clock he had given her as a special present on their first date. A dying Henry asks Meera what she will do when she no longer has him to take care of her; she replies that she will take care of herself. A final scene shows a sunny day and Meera moving out of the now empty house, and driving away.","A woman moves to a small town with her husband, but is rattled when she is targeted for a home invasion."

Racial supremacy and nativism have surged nationwide following their re-election, and many outside the ruling party are concerned that the upcoming Purge will inflict more damage on the country than the NFFA realizes. Married migrant couple Juan and Adela illegally cross the border into Texas to escape from a Mexican drug cartel and build a new life, with Juan working as a farmhand on the Tucker family ranch while Adela begins working near Austin.Ten months later, on the eve of the next annual Purge, Juan and Adela join a migrant community behind a walled sanctuary with armed security to protect them. As the Purge begins, Adela witnesses a Purger group, who declare themselves to be a ""Purge Purification Force"" (PPF) that intend to kill those people that they consider non-American. The group passes by without hostility, and the migrant community survives the Purge with no incidents. Come morning, Juan and Adela return to their jobs, but both notice that many of their co-workers did not report to work. Shortly after, Adela is attacked by two Purgers but she is rescued by her boss Darius before both are arrested by police for killing their attackers.Meanwhile, Juan and fellow migrant co-worker T.T. discover that the Tucker family has been taken hostage by their farmhands, who reveal themselves as Purgers intending to take the ranch for themselves. Ranch owner Caleb Tucker sacrifices himself and distracts the Purgers long enough for Juan and T.T. to rescue his son Dylan, Dylan's pregnant wife Cassie, and his sister Harper, who offer them a ride to search for Adela. Nationwide news struggles to understand why civilians continue to celebrate the Purge after its ending. The group rescue Adela and Darius after the police van carrying them is ambushed by more Purgers. Darius stays behind to search for his family while the others escape from a burning Austin. At a gas station, they hear news reports about chaos and destruction in all fifty American states, with local emergency services overwhelmed, in an event described as the ""Forever Purge"". To protect non-Purger civilians, Canada and Mexico have opened their borders for the next six hours, following which the borders will close and entry would be denied. The group decide to escape across the Mexican border through El Paso.By the time the group arrives in a chaotic El Paso, the NFFA has condemned the Forever Purge after their politicians and representatives are targeted, and invokes martial law across the United States in an effort to contain the violence. In response, the Canadian and Mexican governments announce the early closure of its borders, leaving those who tried to cross it vulnerable to the Purgers. Fighting through El Paso, Adela and Cassie are split from the group by military forces while Juan, T.T., Dylan, and Harper are captured by the PPF, with their leader (referred to as ""Alpha"") offering Dylan and Harper a chance to live if they kill T.T. and Juan. When they refuse, the Purgers murder T.T. before the military intervenes, allowing the group to escape. However, the military is forced to withdraw when their base is destroyed by more Purgers.Downtown, Adela protects Cassie from other Purgers, revealing that she and Juan had once been trained to fight against the Mexican drug cartel before they arrived to America. The survivors all reunite at a hidden safe-house for migrants run by a nearby Native American tribe. Their leader offers to transport everyone across the border as refugees. With the PPF in pursuit, Juan, Adela, and Dylan remain behind with other survivors to make time for the other refugees to escape. Both groups engage in a gunfight until their ammo runs out and draw them in close fight with hand weapons. In the ensuing battle, the Purgers are killed and Alpha takes Adela hostage. However, Juan and Dylan work together to subdue and kill Alpha, saving Adela. The trio rejoin the others in a refugee camp on the other side of the Mexican border where Dylan finds Harper and Cassie. The latter reveals that she had given birth during their time apart. After thanking each other for their help in surviving, Dylan introduces Juan and Adela to his infant daughter.With the entire country in flames, the NFFA is blamed and disbanded for the prolonged violence. News reports indicate that more than two million American people had crossed the Canadian and Mexican borders as refugees while others had rallied to fight back against the Forever Purgers.",All the rules are broken as a sect of lawless marauders decides that the annual Purge does not stop at daybreak and instead should never end.

Today a show with 15 MM viewers is a mega hit. I Love Lucy had 60 MM viewers.In 1939, Lucille Ball (Nicole Kidman), 28, is an actress contracted to RKO Pictures. She gets small parts in big studio productions, but featured mainly in low budget films which gives her the moniker ""Queen of the B-Movies."" She is cast in the comedy Too Many Girls, a film Pugh describes as a bad stage play made into an even worse movie. She meets one of the film's casts, charismatic 22-year-old Cuban singer Desi Arnaz (Javier Bardem) and they fall in love instantly.
Months after filming, they marry and buy a home in Hollywood. Arnaz has a successful stint fronting the Desi Arnaz Orchestra that tours around the country, while Ball continues her film career with little success. After Arnaz serves in World War II, he resumes his success with his orchestra, with Ball having to accompany him because of his infidelity.Ball finally gets a break when she is cast in 1942's The Big Street. The film is only a modest hit, but Ball's performance is praised. She meets with RKO President Charles Koerner (Brian Howe) confident she will get better scripts on par with established stars like Rita Hayworth and Judy Holliday. Instead, he terminates her contract as several actresses RKO loaned to other studios will be returning and there will be nothing for her (Plus she is 35 years old now). He suggests she use her voice for radio, and with no substantial film roles coming, she does. In 1948, she is cast in the radio show My Favorite Husband, which becomes a massive success.The show draws interest from CBS (Producers Howard Wenke (Clark Gregg) & Joe Strickland (Nelson Franklin)) and cigarette company Philip Morris (rep by Roger Otter (Jeff Holman)), who suggested to turn ""My Favorite Husband"" into a television show. Ball agrees but only if Arnaz plays her on-screen husband. The executives initially refuse because Arnaz is Cuban, but later concede after Ball refuses to give them the copyright of the show. She also hopes that working with Arnaz will decrease his infidelity and save their marriage.By 1953, the show is renamed I Love Lucy and becomes a smash hit with nearly 60 million viewers each week. A three-camera system, designed by Arnaz, allows viewers on the East Coast of United States to see the show live and without static (since the show is filmed on the West Coast). During production, Ball deals with several issues on the show; Vivian Vance (Nina Arianda) and William Frawley (J.K. Simmons), who play the Ricardos' married neighbors the Mertzes, do not get along, and Frawley is often drunk on the filming set.
The crew goes about their normal production day. The dynamics are complex. Lucille is very particular that her character on the show should not come across as dumb or dimwitted.Ball also clashes with the directors (Donald Glass (Christopher Denham), to whom she declares that she has no confidence in his abilities to direct the show) and writers during table reads and scene blocking. Lucille has the ability to imagine the scenes as they are being narrated to her, and this gives her the ability to almost predict audience reactions to the jokes and sense check if certain situations and premises would make sense or not.
Particularly troublesome is a scene where Arnaz comes home and covers Ball's eyes while she is setting the table, and she names several different men before he reveals it's him. The couple announce to CBS and Phillip Morris executives that Ball is pregnant. Jess is troubled as Desi wants the pregnancy to be shown on air, while Jess knows that CBS will never allow it. Jess and Desi clash over Lucille's rude attitude towards the other crew members of the show.The executives insist Ball hide the pregnancy behind large objects, but the couple refuses and proposes the pregnancy be shown (though they are never allowed to say the word ""pregnant"" on air).
Lucille continues to undermine Donald's authority during the scene rehearsals. Lucille also comes down hard on Vivian for losing weight. She says that losing weight is not in line with Vivian's character of Ethel. She says that most women want to see themselves on the show, which is a fat, plump Ethel.Ball also deals with Arnaz staying out late, and a photo emerges in the tabloids of him with another woman. Desi tells Lucy that he plays cards on a boat with some other celebrities and sleeps there when he is too tired to come home, and that the picture was taken six months ago. She reluctantly believes him. Frawley has Ball understand that Arnaz's infidelity may stem from her making the business and creative decisions on the show which makes him feel emasculated, though she explains to everyone that he is the one who makes all the decisions. She asks Oppenheimer to give Arnaz a producer credit, hoping it will stop Arnaz's infidelity and save the marriage. Instead, Oppenheimer reminds Arnaz he has top billing, as he is the person saying ""I"" in I love Lucy, in attempt to placate him. Arnaz responds by sharply scolding Oppenheimer for trying to patronize him.The night of the live filming, a newspaper article deems Ball a Communist, though she was cleared during a HUAC hearing months ago. Ball admits she registered as a member of the Communist Party when she was young and influenced by a relative, but Arnaz insists she lie to the public and claim she accidentally marked the wrong box.
Ball refuses to lie to the public, fearing she will be humiliated. Arnaz cancels his usual show warm up with the audience, and instead addresses the audience about the accusations (It's a big gamble, because if the gamble doesn't work, then the show is over then and there). He takes a live call with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who assures all of the audience that Lucy has been cleared of all the charges.As the couple celebrates backstage, Ball shows Arnaz a handkerchief with lipstick on it. Arnaz says it's hers, but Ball shows him another handkerchief with her own lipstick on it, proving Arnaz's infidelity. When filming begins, Ball momentarily loses her concentration. They start over, with Ball being more focused.
The film ends with a title card saying Ball filed for divorce after the taping of their last show in 1960.",Follows Lucy and Desi as they face a crisis that could end their careers--and another that could end their marriage.

Daphne is writing a book about her struggle with mental illness.One afternoon, Philip receives a call from Daphne, who tells him that her best friend Joan has been killed in a hit-and-run accident. Later, Daphne is found dead outside her home, which the police believe to be suicide. Philip comforts her estranged British brother, James Flagg (Sam Claflin), who arrives at the scene extremely distraught. The next evening, James drops by Philip's house to drop off a book that Daphne had borrowed; sympathetic, Grace invites him to stay for dinner. Philip learns that James has written several books and is interested in buying one called Shadow Cast, which will take two weeks to arrive.Dr. Vanessa Fanning (Veronica Ferres) confronts Philip for the unconventional methods he employed to help Daphne, which included confiding in her things that he had never shared with his family. Grace meets up with James to discuss selling his sister's house. She tells him that despite Philip's profession, he has been unable to address the pain of losing Evan and, as a result, the couple has become alienated from each other and from Lucy. Philip soon notices an inappropriate connection between his wife and James and asks James to stay away. Grace secretly goes to see James again and, despite her attempts to break off their relationship, they have sex.James files a formal complaint against Philip with the Washington Board of Psychiatry, and Philip is suspended from his practice until it is fully investigated. James also befriends Lucy, who has a history of discipline and drug problems stemming from her grief over losing her brother, and they soon form a romantic connection. Lucy expresses a desire to run away, and James persuades her to pack her bags so they can do so together, but then later ignores her phone calls, leaving her heartbroken.When Grace's car breaks down, James conveniently appears and offers her a ride home. He purposely misses a turn and begins driving erratically, then knocks Grace unconscious as she attempts to alert Philip. Philip chases them down and saves Grace. Back at home, they tell Lucy that James is a dangerous man but she does not believe them, obsessed by her idea of their relationship. Philip receives a call from Dr. Toth who tells him that James admitted himself to a psychiatry facility due to auditory hallucinations. Philip visits James who admits that he read Daphne's notes about her therapy with Philip, and about Philip's family background. As he is escorted back into his cell, James maniacally tells Philip that he ""still smells"" Grace.Philip finally receives Shadow Cast and sees the real James Flagg on the back cover, exposing the James they have all met as an American man called Eric Dalton, Daphne's abusive ex-boyfriend. Philip discovers that Eric is psychotic; he killed Joan to make Daphne distraught in hopes that she would return to him, and when she didn't, he murdered Daphne. Philip realizes Eric has been taunting his family because Philip had helped Daphne end her relationship with Eric. Philip calls Dr. Toth to order him to lock Eric down, but Eric has already escaped after killing security guards.Realizing that Eric is going after Lucy, Philip and Grace race back to their house. Eric attacks Lucy and, after a violent struggle, Grace kills him with the blade of Evan's old ice-skating boot. The three embrace as the police sirens approach.

When Noah and Lee's (Joel Courtney) parents announce they're selling the beach house where they all spent their childhoods, Elle, Noah, Lee and Lee's girlfriend, Rachel (Meganne Young), offer to spend the summer there to help out with the sale.Lee starts to plan on how he can spend time with Rachel, who's going to a different college, while Elle is suddenly faced with a deadline by Berkeley. She chooses to go to Harvard with Noah which annoys Lee, but Elle promises to make it up to him by spending the summer doing their beach bucket list of various activities (Swim with the sharks, atomic wedgie to Noah, Cliff jumping, sky diving, Sandcastles, Pie eating contest, Brain freeze and so on, helium karaoke and so on).Noah's friend Chloe (Maisie Richardson-Sellers) - who Elle once thought Noah was having an affair with - arrives at the beach house to make things more complicated (Chloe's parents are getting divorced and Noah gets close to her, comforting her), and they all have a heated argument. Before that Chloe makes a light comment about Elle being very good at video games.
Meanwhile Elle runs into Marco at the beach as well. When Elle tells Noah, he is angry, and Elle says that's a double standard as she OK having Chloe in the house.Noah and Marco (Taylor Zakhar Perez) clash at the go-kart track (Elle had asked Noah to dress up as Wario, but he refused and Marco had stepped up, while Elle dressed as Mario and Lee as the Princess. Noah went to race with Marco, but Marco ended up beating him), prompting Noah to call out Elle for not realizing Marco still has feelings for her. Encouraged by Chloe to talk to Elle, Noah quickly makes up with Elle. However, Marco, unwilling to give up, shows up to the Fourth of July party where he again fights with Noah and punches him, but Noah refuses to retaliate.
Meanwhile Elle is also upset that Lee has found another guy, Ashton, who just finished his 1st year at Berkley and the 2 really hit it off and became best friends. Elle is upset for not being Lee's BFF anymore.Marco admits to Elle that he does still have feelings for her, but she's not interested. She goes off to find Noah, but Elle is unaware that Noah saw her acceptance letter to Berkeley. At the same time Elle struggles in accepting her father's new girlfriend, Linda, who tells her she was her mother's friend. She eventually understands and accepts her after her father tells how she and Brad (Carson White) had been his main focus for the last several years and that he deserves a chance in love as well.
Noah's worried that she's only going to Harvard for him (as she has been ignoring Noah while she tries to complete the bucket list with Lee) and he doesn't want Elle to regret it if they later break up. Because of this, Noah breaks up with Elle and encourages her to make a college decision for herself.While dealing with the heartbreak, Elle misses a bucket list with Lee to play Dance Dance Revolution (just before the machine was to be removed forever). They clash when he tells her that he's never mattered to Elle compared to Noah, while she tells him to grow up and that all of her decisions this summer have been about trying to make everybody happy.Noah and Lee's mother tells Elle this much when she comforts her, telling her that she should start thinking about ""what it is that you want to do"" and choose a college based on that. It was also revealed that Noah and Lee's parents eventually decided to not sell the beach house (when they realize that the beach house means a lifetime of memories for the kids), and Rachel broke up with Lee, having seen the issues that Elle and Noah's relationship had, though she hopes they will reunite somehow. Marco apologizes to Elle, and they say their farewells amicably, before Elle reconciles with Lee and tells him that she's realized that she's spent so long maintaining her relationships with Noah and Lee that she hasn't worked out what makes her happy. She applies to University of Southern California (USC), in Game Design (she gets in after she pitches her idea for a fantasy sports league for e-sports). She tells the news to Lee, who is happy for her.Six years later, Elle is developing her own game. She and Lee remained close friends, both often visiting the fated Kissing Booth at the Charity Fair. Additionally, Lee and Rachel reunited with each other and got engaged after college. Sometime later, Elle sees Noah for (presumably) the first time since their breakup where he reveals he has job offers at law firms in Los Angeles and New York. He hasn't decided where he's going but does suggest going on a motorcycle ride when he's back in town. Noah says he will call Elle and she says she would like that. They part ways, but not before looking back each other - it is made clear they have never stopped loving each other.At the end of the movie, you see Elle and Noah riding down the coastline in California on their motorcycles, laughing and having fun, alluding that Noah chose the LA office and they rekindled their romance now that they have both grown up.","It's the summer before Elle Evans is set to head off to college, and she has a big decision to make."

He states his belief that the Indian underclass is trapped in a perpetual state of servitude, like chickens in a chicken coop.As a child in Laxmangarh, Balram is offered a scholarship to a school in Delhi because of his advanced academics. He is told that he is a ""white tiger,"" someone born only once in a generation. However when his father is unable to pay off village landlord 'the Stork', Balram is forced by his grandmother to work in the village's tea stall, and he never returns to school. Balram's father dies from tuberculosis, with no doctor to treat him.As an adult, Balram aspires to become a chauffeur for the Stork's son Ashok, who has returned from the United States with his Jackson Heights-raised wife Pinky. Balram has his grandmother sponsor his driving lessons, with the promise of sharing his chauffeur salary. Balram is hired as the Stork family's second driver, but is also given menial tasks to complete and is otherwise mistreated. Balram is kept loyal by the threat of him and his entire family being murdered if he were to conduct a betrayal.Ashok and Pinky make plans to move to Delhi, where Ashok will bribe Indian politicians so that his family would avoid paying tax money. Balram, wanting to drive for them in Delhi, exposes the secret of the family's primary driver: he is a Muslim.

The Stork family coerces Balram into signing a confession endorsed by his grandmother. Ultimately, no one is charged, but Balram is left shaken, and in no doubt that he is completely disposable to the Stork family.Pinky leaves Ashok to return to New York, leaving Balram to emotionally support him.

He angers the Stork family when he donates change to a beggar. Balram's grandmother unexpectedly sends one of his younger nephews to live with him in order to learn how to become a driver.

Suffering from memory loss, she does not remember who she is or how she got there. She is assisted by an advanced A.I. named M.I.L.O. (Medical Interface Liaison Officer), but it refuses to open the cryo unit without an administrator code. Using MILO, she is able to transmit outside the pod and contact emergency services. She provides them with the cryo unit's model and serial number, which are printed on the interior. Upon contacting the manufacturer they are told the unit was destroyed three years prior. Unable to recall her memories, she looks for clues about her past by searching for pictures and articles through the AI computer and finds her name, Elizabeth Hansen. She realizes she is a cryogenic doctor. She finds her husband, Léo Ferguson, and his contact number by accessing her social media, but when she calls his number a woman answers. She tells the woman that she is Léo's wife and demands to speak to him.

She then receives a call back from the police but suspects they are hiding something from her, and disconnects. The unknown woman she called earlier rings and tells her that her husband is dead.

Her secret mission is to travel to a new planet, as mankind will be extinct in the near future due to a deadly virus.

As time passes by and with oxygen levels fading, she prepares for suicide by attempting to open the pod. Shortly after, she discovers Léo is also in hypersleep in the damaged spaceship together with nearly 10,000 others, but she notices he lacks a scar on his forehead that he had before. Upon further investigation, through a video presented by an elderly version of her, it is revealed that she is a genetic clone with the original Elizabeth Hansen's personality and memories implanted, including memories of Léo. The woman she has been speaking to on earth is the original, and now elderly, Elizabeth Hansen.MILO activates a euthanasia protocol due to a non-existent chance of survival, however Elizabeth's clone manages to deactivate it and successfully diverts the functions of the processor and is put back in hypersleep.

In the city of Nonsuch, California, middle-schooler Barney Pudowski is the only kid in his class who doesn't have a B-bot. His former childhood friends, Savannah Meades, Rich Belcher, Noah and Ava have all become absorbed by their individual B-bots. On Barney's 12th birthday, his father, Graham, and his grandmother, Donka, come to realize that he doesn't have any friends. They hastily go to a Bubble store, but closes for the day, leading them to buy a slightly-damaged one from the store's delivery driver.Barney receives the B-bot as his late-birthday gift, but upon activating it, he quickly learns that it's defective and glitchy. Not wanting to upset his father, Barney decides to take it back to the Bubble store to get it fixed, but ends up running into Rich and his friends who taunt and try to humiliate Barney. The B-bot begins to fight back as his safety functions have been disabled, with him and Barney happily running off. However, Rich called the police and they along with Graham and Donka are taken to the Bubble store so that the B-bot can be crushed. Not wanting to see him go, Barney secretly rescues him and names him Ron, a shortened version of his model number.When Barney and Ron's actions are reported, Marc is happy to see Ron go against his programming while his COO Andrew Morris views it as bad publicity, believing Ron must be destroyed for the issue to be resolved. Barney teaches Ron how to be a good friend and, while hanging out, runs into Savannah who tells Ron that he needs to help Barney get friends. Despite Barney telling Savannah not to, she posts Ron's actions online, alerting Bubble. The next day, Ron gets out of the house and tries to get ""friends"" for Barney, bringing a series of random people to school. As Barney gets in trouble, Rich discovers Ron's unlocked function and downloads it, causing all the other B-bots to have their safety features turned off. The B-bots run wild and, in the end, after the B-Bots have a patch update, Savannah is publicly humiliated.Barney is kicked out from school and tells Ron off, but upon returning home, realizes that Ron was truly being a friend and decides to run away with him when Bubble employees come for him. They briefly run into Savannah, still upset over her incident, and tells her that he is hiding in the woods. Meanwhile, while Andrew warns Marc about the ramifications of the B-bot, Marc sneaks away so that he can meet Ron while Bubble uses their resources to take control of all the B-bots to go looking for Ron and Barney in the woods. Due to the cold weather and Barney's asthma, he becomes weak and Ron brings him back to civilization just outside the school where Savannah, Rich, Noah and Ava rush out to help him.Barney is taken to the hospital and recuperates before meeting Marc who patched Ron, making him like every other B-Bot. Barney demands that Marc access the cloud to get Ron's original personality, but Andrew took over the Bubble company and locked Marc out. Through an elaborate plan for Barney, Graham, Donka and Marc breaking into Bubble HQ, Barney manages to make it to the Bubble database, finds Ron's original data by his light and uploads him back into his body, restoring him back to his original code. Seeing that Bubble has direct access to everyone's B-bot and realizing that everyone is just as lonely as he was, Barney suggests upgrading all the B-bots to have Ron's flaws. However, this means that Ron will be dispersed. Barney reluctantly says goodbye to Ron as his programming is spread to everyone, mixing Marc's friendship algorithm with Ron's code. Marc blackmails Andrew into giving his position of CEO back after secretly recording him admitting that the B-bots spy on their owners for profit.Three months later, everyone has a faulty B-bot, but are happy with their wild and weird personalities. Barney no longer has one, but has become much more sociable and has gotten close with his former friends. As they hang out at recess, a giant Bubble tower that overlooks Nonsuch produces Ron's face.","The story of Barney, an awkward middle-schooler and Ron, his new walking, talking, digitally-connected device. Ron's malfunctions set against the backdrop of the social media age launch them on a journey to learn about true friendship."

Her mother, Sarah, abandoned her outside a hospital. The security footage of Margot's mother abandoning her disturbs her to this day, as she wonders what drove Sarah to make such a drastic decision. In the present, she meets her blood relative Samuel, who, through a genetics site, discovered that he has a living relative. Soon after, they are joined by Dale, who would be the soundman for the documentary. Samuel leads them to the small Amish community of Beiler Farm, where Margot's mother came from.Jacob, the patriarch of the commune and Sarah's father, welcomes the team, where they find lodging in a rustic room. Late at night, Margot wakes up and discovers red lights moving in the distance. When Margot asks Samuel about the lights the next day, he tells her about a bear that has claimed some of the livestock. Margot visits the barn and finds a little girl brushing her doll's hair. The doll is named Sarah, and when Margot tells the girl that that was her mother's name, the girl cryptically says that Sarah is ""still there."" In the night, strange noises are heard in the attic, and Margot ventures into the old room, which was her mother's. She catches a ghost on camera, and while Dale thinks it's terrifying, Chris is eager to dismiss it as a lens flare.The next morning, they interview Jacob on camera, who tells them about Sarah, who was apparently a free-spirited woman who cared for no one but herself. To defy the practice of marrying someone within the commune, she slept with a boy from the neighboring village and became pregnant. Since pregnancy out of wedlock was against custom, the community intended to force Sarah to give up her baby to a married couple within the group. Sarah instead abandoned her baby at the hospital. Margot is slow to assimilate the story and realizes that her mother had no say in an oppressive society. Sarah is presumed dead, but Margot believes her mother is still alive.While reviewing drone footage, the team finds a church about a mile away from the farm. The church is locked, with the German words ""so weit nicht weiter"" engraved on the door. The phrase cryptically means ""this far, no further."" Before they can enter the church, however, Jacob approaches to tell them that the church is forbidden. That night, Margot and the team discover a strange ritual in the barn in which a newborn two-headed goat is sacrificed.The mystery deepens and Jacob's warning intrigues Margot even more. While Samuel gives Dale a riding lesson, Margot and Chris sneak into the church and discover strange murals drawn on the floor depicting a demonic figure named Asmodeus and scenes of ritual sacrifice. Upon further digging, Chris finds a hidden compartment under the altar, leading to a moat. Seizing the opportunity, Margot asks Chris to lower her into the pit. She hears a strange noise in the darkness before panicking and calling for help. Back in her room, Chris replays the video and discerns that the noise is from an animal.The next day, Margot enters Jacob's room while he is elsewhere and finds a computer in a small adjoining room. She finds correspondence between Jacob and Samuel, and it appears that Jacob knows all about Margot's life. She becomes upset and Chris suggests they leave. That night, a ghoulish shadow attacks Margot in her room. Chris and Dale wake up to find Margot in shock and her sheet soaked with blood. The doctor tells them about Margot's unusual menstrual flow, but they don't believe it.Chris and Dale venture out into the snow to find a ride into town to get a new battery for the vehicle, and the guy giving them a ride also tells them that the people at Beiler Farm are not Amish. Chris and Dale use the store's computer to come to the conclusion that Beiler Farm is a community of demon worshippers. According to myth, the Norwegian village of Beskytter suffered a massacre. It was thought to be the work of Asmodeus, the prince of demons. They trapped the demon inside the body of a woman, who would now pass from mother to daughter in the bloodline.Chris realizes that Sarah has been subjected to a ritual sacrifice to contain the demon god Asmodeus in her body. When Chris and Dale return from their trip from the store, Margot has disappeared. While Dale leaves to install the battery, Chris enters the demonic church to search for Margot. After a bloody encounter with Jacob, Chris finds Margot at the bottom of the pit. He manages to bring Margot back to her senses, but a skeletal creature chases them into the snowy forest as they climb. While in the woods, the creature attacks Dale, while Chris and Margot manage to escape, and seek shelter in the barn, but that doesn't save them. The creature attacks Chris, but Margot calls her name Sarah, and that seems to stop it momentarily. Margot then pushes the creature, which falls onto a spiked row of farm tools, becoming impaled there.While trying to start the truck, Chris realizes that the key is still in Dale's possession. Returning to the woods, they discover Dale dead but recover the keys. When they return to the farm, it has been turned into an inferno. Fulfilling the prophecy of the demon's release, the neighbors are killing each other, much of the livestock is dead and the houses are burning. Then, fortunately, the car starts and they escape from the burning inferno. Later, a police patrol arrives on the scene to see the extent of the damage. A child cries in the barn. When the policeman inquires, he discovers that the child is none other than Samuel. Nodding, the policemen blow their heads off. The demon has possessed Samuel. The last shot shows him driving into the woods, presumably in search of Chris and Margot.","Margot, a young woman who was abandoned by her mother as a baby, travels to a secluded Amish community with a documentary film crew seeking answers about her mother and extended family."

Honnold mentions Marc-Andre Leclerc (Canadian rock and alpine climber), a climber who is relatively unknown due to his elusive and low-profile nature. There is little video footage of Leclerc's climbs, because, as Honnold states, ""He's just going out and climbing for himself in such a pure style.""
Marc is an expert in alpine solo climbs and conquers the most difficult alpine peaks and mountain faces all by himself.In 2015, director Peter Mortimer, a climber himself, comes across a blog post about Leclerc, a 23-year-old Canadian who had solo climbed a famous climbing route known as The Corkscrew (1,250m, 5.10d, A1) on Cerro Torre. Mortimer himself was a fan of Derek Hersey, who could climb mountains with nothing more than a chalk bag and a pair of old tennis shoes. Derek died when he slipped and fell on one his climbs.
Peter was captivated by solo free climbers, who put life and limb on the line for glory.
Climbing used to outlawed and for vagabonds. But now it is a high-profile Olympic sport with armies of followers behind top athletes.
Mortimer travels to Squamish, British Columbia-the heart of Canada's climbing scene-to meet Leclerc. Leclerc is quirky and unaccustomed to being filmed. Unlike others, he doesn't care about accolades or fame; he simply climbs for his love of climbing and adventure. Marc is 23 years old. Marc had moved to Squamish after high school, to join the ranks of hard-core climbers. He was not afraid to put his body on the line to learn climbing.
Marc didn't have any money or even a phone. He lived under a stairwell. He had a girlfriend named Brette. They moved into a tent in the forest to live cheaply.
The old timers liked him as he was not doing anything for Instagram glory. He just liked climbing.Although Leclerc enjoys free solo rock climbing on Stawamus Chief in Squamish, breaking Honnold's speed record on The Grand Wall (1000 feet, 5.11a) (from 59 minutes to 57 minutes), his main aspirations are in solo alpine climbing. Honnold knew that Marc was not doing it for the records, he just enjoyed the spiritual aspects of climbing.
Marc met Brette on the party circuit in Squamish. This was right after high school, and Marc was into drugs use. Brette brought Marc to climbing.
Alpinism is the discipline of climbing big and technical mountains. Mountain climbs began in the 30's and 40's with large crews and lots of gear. But by the 50's it was also important how one made the climb. Climbing was a form of freedom, and the ultimate form of that freedom was to climb alone, solo. Solo climbing is an art of surviving in the craziest situations. Half of the solo climbers of all time have died in the mountains.Mortimer's crew travels with him to Canmore in the Canadian Rockies for ice climbing season. Ice climbing is rarely done solo as it is climbing frozen water. Ice can collapse at any second.
Although incredibly dangerous and rarely done, in a single day Leclerc solo climb both ice and mixed routes of rock and ice, including on the notorious Stanley Headwall, where he free solos famous routes such as Nightmare on Wolf Street (WI6+, M6), French Reality (WI6+, 5.8), and Nemesis (WI6). This attracts the interest of local climbers.
Marc was good friends with his mother. He had ADHD and was home schooled for a while. Marc played a lot in the woods and read books on adventure. He first read a book on mountains when he was 8 years old. After a couple of years, he took up technical climbing.Leclerc becomes restless as the film crew plans the next shoot and drops off the radar for months, to Mortimer's frustration. The crew eventually tracks Leclerc down to the Ghost River Wilderness Area in Alberta. Brette Harrington, Leclerc's girlfriend and fellow climber, remarks that Leclerc is a free spirit who doesn't care about films or ""making his own climb significant to the world.""In April 2016, news breaks that Leclerc has completed the first winter solo ascent of the Emperor Face of Mount Robson in British Columbia via the alpine climbing route Infinite Patience (2,250m, VI, 5.9, WI5, M5). This sends shock-waves throughout the climbing community, and Mortimer is frustrated that Leclerc made the solo ascent without letting his crew know. Leclerc tells him that ""it wouldn't be a solo to me if somebody was there."" Having now completed the first solo ascent, Leclerc invites the crew to Mount Robson to film his method of solo alpine climbing. Leclerc carries no communication devices and climbs on-sight, meaning that he has never been on the mountain and ""never rehearsed the route.""
Experienced climbers are happy for Marc for accomplishing these feats, but they know that he is taking huge risks.Months later, Leclerc travels to Patagonia to attempt the first winter solo ascent of Torre Egger, and on-sight, a longtime dream of his. Torre Egger is lashed by vicious storms in the winter and is not an easy climb in the summer either.
Leclerc allows one cameraman, his climbing friend Austin Siadak, but only for the lower sections of the route-a variation of Dani Arnold [de]'s 2010 Winter Link-Up route that finishes with Titanic (950m, 5.10, A1) on the southeast face. Leclerc would then complete the summit push alone with a small camera. After days of climbing, a snowstorm hits, and Leclerc-only four pitches from the summit-is forced to abandon his Bivvy, rappel the mountain in blizzard conditions, and hike back to El Chaltén.Mortimer expects Leclerc to pack up and fly back home, but Leclerc is determined to complete the climb. No longer an on-sight ascent, Leclerc decides to raise the stakes by climbing without any additional food or Bivvy equipment. On September 17, 2016, Leclerc completes the entire route in just 21 hours, thus completing the first-ever solo winter ascent of Torre Egger on a route with difficulties of 5.10, WI3, M5, and A1.Mortimer begins assembling the documentary with his footage. In March 2018, Harrington calls Mortimer and tells him that Leclerc and his climbing partner Ryan Johnson have gone missing while descending Mendenhall Towers in Alaska. Mortimer travels to Alaska with Harrington and Leclerc's family and friends to search for him. Near the climbers' descent route, Juneau Mountain Rescue discovers ropes buried in avalanche snow, and it is presumed that Leclerc and Johnson are both dead. Their bodies are never recovered.Months after the accident, a memorial is held for Leclerc in Squamish.","Marc-André Leclerc climbs alone, far from the limelight. The free-spirited 23-year-old makes some of the boldest solo ascents in history. With no cameras and no margin for error, Leclerc's approach is the essence of solo adventure."

She turns off all the lights in her bedroom except for her desk lamp before reapproaching the camera holding a stuffed toy lemur. She starts recording a video where she recites her introduction and states her intent to take the challenge, and introduces the lemur toy as ""Poe,"" whom she says will also be taking the challenge. She says she ""doesn't know what to expect."" She turns off her lamp, says ""I want to go to the World's Fair"" three times while staring directly into the camera, and stabs her finger with a pinback button before smearing her blood on her laptop. She then watches a video of colorful, flashing strobe lights, staring unblinkingly into the lights as she does so. She thanks her viewers and promises to post updates if she starts to ""notice any changes.""Casey later views other videos related to the World's Fair challenge. These include a young man who has taken on the challenge and claims he's ""turning into something,"" and a video in which a mysterious, distorted voice asks if the viewer wants to join ""the internet's scariest online horror game"" before warning the viewer, ""we can't be held responsible for what you become."" The voice also says that ""if other players like the direction you're taking the story, they'll help you expand it further"" - implying that the World's Fair challenge is merely an elaborate alternate reality game and that all the videos from users who claim to be experiencing ""changes"" are dramatized. Casey later watches another video of a man sitting on his bathroom floor, stating that a game of Tetris is being played inside of him. Casey pauses the video to look up the most common ""symptoms"" players have experienced after starting the challenge. She clicks on a video entitled ""I can't feel my body!"" uploaded by a user named Keith. In this video, a shirtless Keith is running on a treadmill and repeatedly slapping himself, but appears to show no physical reaction to the stimulus. Another video entitled ""I am turning to plastic"" then begins playing, of a doll-like young woman with smooth, glistening skin dramatically posing for the camera while ambient pop music plays. As she watches the video, Casey's father pounds on her door and berates her for watching videos at three o'clock in the morning. Casey apologizes to him and shuts her laptop, but still does not go to sleep.The next day, Casey ventures into the woods near her house, where she continues recording. She explains to her viewers that she took the challenge because she loves horror movies and thought it would be cool to try living life as if she was in one. She explains that she would often sleepwalk as a child and have very strange dreams due to the scary stories she would invent in her head. She also notes that even though the temperature outside is cold, she does not feel anything. At home, she records another video where she says she's going to film herself sleeping that night. She subsequently gets into bed and struggles for a bit to fall asleep before reapproaching the camera, stopping the recording, and slamming the laptop shut. She puts her hat and coat on and goes outside, carrying a lantern. She approaches her father's barn, picking the lock to get in, and finds his shotgun. She sits down on the couch in the barn and begins to watch an ASMR video, which she projects from her phone onto the wall, of a young woman soothing the viewer and telling them to go back to bed after they had a nightmare. After the ASMR video ends, another video begins playing, entitled ""A message for Casey from JLB,"" uploaded by a user called JLB. The video contains a distorted image of Casey's face that becomes increasingly more disfigured as the video progresses, played over sounds of demonic laughter. The words ""YOU ARE IN TROUBLE"" and ""I NEED TO TALK TO YOU"" then flash on the screen.Casey watches one of JLB's videos, in which he states that he loves collaborating with other players, but warns the viewer that his channel is strictly ""in-game"" and that only ""serious players"" are welcome on his channel. Casey calls JLB on Skype. He apologizes for frightening her with his video, explaining that he didn't know how else to get her attention. JLB then explains that he's been following her videos and asks how much she's read up on about the challenge. Casey says she's only really watched others' videos on it, and JLB states that the history of the World's Fair challenge is actually much deeper than it appears. JLB says the challenge is like a conduit that is able to access the players' subconscious minds, and that he has witnessed it do things to players that Casey could not comprehend. Casey asks why JLB has reached out to her, and he says he wants to help her, but asks her to promise that none of the statements she made in her video in the woods were false. She agrees, but is unable to explain further when JLB prompts her to. Casey says that she can ""feel herself leaving her body,"" as if the challenge is turning her into a new person entirely. JLB asks her to keep making videos so that he knows she is okay, and she agrees before he ends the call. The movie cuts to a shot of JLB in his own room, revealing him to be a middle-aged balding man. Much like Casey, he spends most of his time watching other World's Fair videos. He watches a video made by the same man who claimed he could feel Tetris being played in his organs. The man talks about a plush doll of Stitch from Lilo & Stitch he yearned to win from an arcade as a child. He then shows a series of green scales that have begun growing across his arm, and pulls a long strip of arcade tickets from underneath a patch of scales. JLB then plays a pixel game based on the World's Fair challenge before watching another video. Dramatically shot in the style of a horror film, the video consists of a young man talking to his friend on the phone, imploring him to not watch a video, as ""it's getting stronger."" His friend ignores his behest and performs the same ritual that Casey did at the beginning of the movie. A pair of hands reach out of his laptop screen, cover his mouth as he cries out in horror, and pull him into the laptop. Another video from a user named Rebecca, entitled ""Demon Wings,"" consists of a young woman staring wordlessly into the camera with a pair of black, feathery wings sprouting from her back.JLB then makes another video for Casey, in which he records a voiceover over one of her videos. Casey's video is another attempt at recording herself sleeping, as she ""needs to figure out what's going on."" At around 4:55 A.M., by JLB's estimate, Casey appears to wake up, but does not move at all aside from widening her eyes and grinning madly as her lamp shines on her face. JLB says this video is Casey's most disturbing one yet, and implores her to continue making them so he can still monitor her well-being. Casey later uploads another video entitled ""losing control of myself."" In it, she gleefully sings and dances around her room to a karaoke version of a pop song, but inexplicably begins convulsing and screaming in terror in the middle of the song before continuing to dance as though nothing has happened. She then uploads a video entitled ""a tour of my high school,"" where she actually just films herself walking through a cemetery and refers to the headstones as lockers, desks, and faculty offices, respectively. Casey's next upload, entitled ""guess where i am today,"" consists of her standing on the side of the road and filming cars that go by, ultimately zooming in on an AutoZone across the street. In her next upload, ""dumbass waterfall,"" Casey films a stream near her house late at night while promising the viewer that someday, she will ""disappear,"" and nobody will ever be able to discover what has happened to her. In her next upload, ""random thought,"" Casey films herself walking from a downward angle. She comments on the gun that her father keeps hidden in the barn, and on the fact that he foolishly believes she is unaware he has it. Her next upload, ""hey how was your Christmas?"", consists of Christmas lights and decorations that people in her area have put up. She focuses the camera on a wooden cutout of Santa Claus, commands it to ""stop smiling,"" and insults it.Casey later uploads another video of her sleeping; this is the sixth sleeping video she has made thus far. In the middle of it, she wakes up, eerily crawls towards the camera, and says, ""I see you there, even if you won't show your face. You can't stop me."" This message is presumably directed towards JLB, who is shown to be watching the video in his own bedroom. JLB makes another video addressed to her, where he admits that he spent most of the holiday season thinking about her and rewatching her videos in search of ""clues."" He then states that he senses the ""forces of the fair pulling her in closer with each upload,"" and that he wants to save her. He asks her to send him a message once she watches his video.In Casey's next video, her mental state seems to have gone somewhat back to normal. She shuffles a tarot deck and pulls some cards before she explains that the person watching must be a ""lonely person"" who ""seeks comfort in the things they cannot have."" She also states that the viewer struggles with ""mental issues,"" such as anxiety, and is trying to deceive people by ""walking around like they know everything."" She says she hates people like that, then asks the viewer ""How strong are you really? How powerful are you really?"" She thanks her viewers for watching and ends the video. In her next video, Casey films a walk through her town at night on New Year's Eve, stating her intention to use her father's gun to either kill him or herself. She then asks the viewer, ""Why won't you help me?""In her next video, Casey sets up her camera on a tripod in her bathroom and films herself sitting in front of her mirror, smearing toothpaste under her eyes. The video after that consists of Casey with her face and arms completely covered in green glow paint with all the lights in her room off. She holds Poe, her lemur doll, up to the camera and speaks for him in a high-pitched voice, introducing himself to the viewer and saying he loves them. Casey then confesses that she is afraid of the dark and that Poe, who she has had since she was a newborn, helps her sleep at night. She then tears him apart and turns her light back on, but tearfully expresses regret when she sees the ruined toy. She lies down on her floor cuddling the remains of Poe and staring listlessly up at her ceiling.While on another Skype call with JLB, she says she ""knows how it's gonna end now"" - she is going to be transported inside her computer. She inquires if JLB is familiar with the strange loop theory, which JLB says is just one theory out of many, but Casey insists that she has always had a looming suspicion that her life has just been one long, continuous dream that she needs to wake up from. JLB then asks if Casey has heard of an entity known as ""Ka-Rom,"" who aims to ""trap"" Casey inside the ""fairgrounds"" and is only deceiving her into believing the strange loop theory to achieve this outcome. Casey asks JLB how much time he estimates is left until she commits suicide. He does not answer, instead saying he needs to ask her a question, but that the two of them need to ""go out of game"" for him to do so. Casey asks what he means by that, and he explains that they must briefly break character and stop operating as if the World's Fair is real. Initially appearing upset and confused at the insinuation that the World's Fair is purely fictitious, Casey agrees. JLB expresses his concern for her, but Casey states that the World's Fair is a horror game, so it only makes sense that her videos would contain unsettling subject matter. JLB says he is empathetic to her plight, as he himself struggled with suicidal thoughts as a teenager, and admits that he considered contacting the police to do a wellness check on Casey, but refrained because he doesn't know where she lives. Casey is horrified to learn that JLB assumed her suicidal and homicidal ideations were genuine, and tells him Casey isn't even her real name before abruptly ending the call. She messages him demanding that he never speak to her again and accusing him of having a pedophilic attraction to her. JLB goes into his living room, where he mutters incomprehensibly to Casey as if she is still there, before going back to his bedroom and trying to call her again. His attempts at contact are immediately rejected. He messages her ""please don't do it,"" and asks her to continue making videos.Sometime in the future, JLB makes another video stating that a year after the events of the film occurred, Casey reached out to him on Skype again, whereupon she apologized for distancing herself from him and explained that she spent a few months in a psychiatric institution, and only just recently felt emotionally stable enough to message people again. They shared their real names with one another before Casey revealed she was soon to attend a theater program in New York City. They met in person for the first time in Manhattan, getting coffee and making awkward small talk. As they prepared to part ways, JLB felt confident enough to ask her about the occurrences of that night, but she interrupted him and apologized for the things she had said, which he forgave her for. He then recalls that Casey told him, ""That night, I made it there. I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. I made it there, to the planetarium, across the crowds, into the heart of the fair. But something brought me back. I don't know what it was."" JLB then confessed he stayed up all night praying for her safety. Casey said she knew, as she could feel it. At that point, they got pizza together and made plans to meet up again to see a movie before sharing a hug and parting ways. Whether or not this meeting actually occurred or is merely a story fabricated by JLB is left unclear.","Alone in her attic bedroom, teenager Casey becomes immersed in an online role-playing horror game, wherein she begins to document the changes that may or may not be happening to her."

During his job, he collects usable parts and after work, he salvages, repairs, and sells them to a thrift shop owned by one of his acquaintances. Since divorcing his wife, Clean has lived alone in a workshop while his daughter has long since died. He is always haunted and tortured by the memories of what happened to his beloved daughter and the crimes he had committed in the past. He prepared a meal the next morning for his neighbor, a teenage girl named Dianda, who is living with her grandmother.Meanwhile, a man named Michael is waiting for his son, Mikey, outside the prison gates. As Michael was about to go and meet his son, Mikey is instead picked up by his friends and drives away with them. Annoyed with Mikey's behavior, he decided to let it slide. While picking up trash in the evening near a seafood restaurant owned by Michael, Clean notices Michael and his armed goons are in the middle of a drug trafficking deal which they smuggle through the fish's body from China. However, Clean continued to do his job as usual. Michael is upset that the Chinese suppliers have shorted him five pouches of cocaine, totalling 200 grams.The next morning, Clean sees Dianda walking down the street and was told that her school bus no longer operates in her area due to service cuts. He offers to drive Dianda to school. After sending her to school, Clean dropped off a bike at Dianda's house that belonged to his daughter. However, Dianda's grandmother, Ethel, came out and asked why Clean was so concerned about her. Clean replied he did it to save himself from the guilt that always tormented him. Following this, Ethel tells him that he's a nice guy. But Clean responded back that he's not.At Michael's restaurant, he beats one of his Chinese partners to death for shorting him on the cocaine. Mikey, who saw his father's actions was silent in horror by his father's cruelty. That evening, Clean notices the blood and the glasses of Michael's partner that he brutally murdered while emptying the trash container. As he empties the container, Michael suddenly appears behind him and apologizes for the stench. He tries to offer some money for Clean, but Clean refuses and continues doing his job.The next day, Clean's car breaks down in a bad neighborhood. While looking for the problem, a group of thugs chase a man past Clean into an alley. Clean follows them into the alley when suddenly one of the thugs appears behind him and knocks him out with a baseball bat. Clean wakes up in a hospital and was told a doctor to take prescribed medication, but Clean refuses and chose to go straight home.The next day while on paid leave, Clean drives by and sees Dianda hanging with some thugs. He tells her that it's getting late and go home. Dianda coldly replies he's not her father to order her around. The thugs get confrontational and order Clean to leave. However, Dianda finally agrees with Clean's request to avoid an argument.At Michael's home, Michael gets into a heated argument with his son at dinner for hanging out with his friends instead of helping him running a drug business. Mikey then threatens him with a knife and decided to run away from home.Clean works to cleanup an abandoned building and finds a large pipe wrench inside. He finds Dianda being force-fed drugs and alcohol by the thugs. The thugs set up a phone to record what they're doing. Clean beats the thugs with the pipe wrench and takes Dianda back to her grandmother's home. One of the thugs is Michael's son.The next morning, Michael stands over Mikey at home. He is told that Mikey needs surgery or he might never speak again, but Michael refuses so Mikey can learn a lesson from his disobedience. Michael watches the recording from the prior night, revealing Clean's identity. He orders Frank, a corrupt police officer, to kill Dianda and her grandmother first and bring Clean alive.Clean attempts to leave the city with Dianda and Ethel, but notices that he's being followed. While being pulled over, he recognizes the police officer as one who has been bribed by Michael. He speeds off but his car starts breaking down although he manages to evade the police. They then stop at a bowling alley and diner. Dianda escorts her grandmother to use the restroom while Clean looks around the parking a lot for a vehicle to steal. Some of Michael's henchmen notice his car and enter the diner. They chase Dianda and Ethel to the back rooms of the building. Clean intercepts them and kills each one in brutal hand-to-hand combat.After stopping at a motel for the night, Ethel blames Clean for putting them in danger and for not being able to return home. Clean vows to make things right and returns to the neighborhood. He returns to his residence to collect the money that he had to buy weapons from his friend's thrift shop and prepares for his fight with Michael.At Michael's residence, Frank gets a call from one of his fellow officers. He learns that Clean was a feared professional assassin known as ""The Grim Reaper"" who disappeared years ago. After his daughter died he decided to quit and secluded himself in the city. Clean calls Michael and warns him that he knows his address and that he is coming for him. Clean uses his salvage skills to improvise a silencer for a pump shotgun he saws the stock of made of various auto and other parts. Michael prepares all his men to deal with Clean.Clean crashes the garbage truck into Michael's home and gets into a shootout with Michael's men, killing them effortlessly. As Clean looks for Michael, he is surprised by Michael and is beaten by him. Clean turns the fight around and is about to kill Michael when Mikey appears from his room armed with a gun. Michael thinks his son will kill Clean, but Mikey empties the weapon into his father. Mikey then attempts to shoot Clean but is out of ammo.Some time after the fight, Dianda's neighborhood has now been freed from the criminal activities as more kids have come out to play in the street. While pedaling down the street, Dianda notices a garbage truck approaching and smiles. (thanks to Wikipedia)","Tormented by his past, a garbage man named Clean attempts a quiet life of redemption.

Later, the same woman, with her eyes gouged out, counts down from ten in a stat icky voice as another woman passes behind her. A SWAT team - consisting of Slater, Oursler, Sprayberry, Spivey, Petro and Nash, and their cameraman Gary - raid a warehouse during what is believed to be a drug bust.

Finally, followers, tonight is the night you've been waiting for. Track my signal. The signal is the stimulant. The signal is the sedative. The signal is salvation."" As the officers charge through the tight corridors, they discover multiple prison cell-like rooms with television sets displaying static. They spot a man sitting in one of the rooms, but as the officers order him to not move, they realize he is dead, with his eyes gouged out and the viscous white substance-the drug the SWAT team is after-dripping onto the floor.Advancing through the warehouse in search of suspects, the team enters the room seen in the VHS tape and encounter more dead cultists.

Written and directed by Chloe Okuno
""The Veggie Masher"" commercial directed and edited by Steven Kostanski, produced by Astron-6 Video
In Westerville, Ohio, Channel 6 News reporter Holly Marciano and her cameraman Jeff are filming a story about the Rat Man, a crypt-id of local legend who has supposedly been living in the town's storm drains. After interviewing several of the town's citizens who have reportedly witnessed the creature to gain information, the duo descend into a storm drain, where they find several homeless encampments. While filming, they are approached by a man covered in black slime. Holly tries to interview him, but when he begins to spit up black liquid and murmurs ""Raatma,"" they attempt to flee. Before they can make their escape, they are captured by other residents of the sewers.They are taken deeper into the sewers by the dwellers. The minister of the local church, who Holly had interviewed earlier, appears and announces that a new order will soon begin. He then summons the Rat Man, which is revealed to be a grotesque half-human/half-rat creature dubbed ""Raatma"" that he and the other sewer dwellers worship as a god. Raatma proceeds to vomit black liquid, which the minister pours over Jeff's face, the viscous substance killing him as it melts the flesh from his head. Holly is then brought before Raatma, the creature growling in approval as she screams.After a brief infomercial for ""The Veggie Masher"" plays, the film returns to the newscast, where Holly's co-anchor explains that she was rescued from the storm drain and has returned to work at the station, though Jeff is still missing. Holly gives her next report, unwittingly substituting random words with ""Raatma"", confusing her co-anchor. She suddenly vomits the black liquid on his face, melting it off as he dies screaming on air. As the newsroom erupts in panic, Holly, revealed to have been successfully converted/brain-washed by the sewer cult, cheerfully finishes her report, signing off with ""Hail Raatma.""Holy Hell (Interlude 1)
Back in the framing story, the officers go deeper into the building and come across a room set up to look like a church, with a giant screen at the front and severed mannequins in the seats. The giant screen begins to play video footage from a funeral home.The Empty Wake
Written and directed by Simon Barrett
At Jensen Funeral Home, a young woman named Hailey is assigned to host a wake for a man named Andrew Edwards. whose family has requested that the service be video recorded during the whole night. Hailey's boss Ronald and another assistant, Tim, leave the building for the night, leaving Hailey to pass the time reading. A strong thunderstorm begins outside, causing the power to flicker. Hailey then calls her friend Sharon, asking for her to check the local obituaries for Andrew's name. When she hears strange noises from the casket, which has moved on the bier, Hailey calls Tim and says that she thinks Andrew may still be alive. Tim quells her worries by explaining that the body is most likely releasing gases that are causing the noises. As the storm worsens, the building begins to occasionally lose power. A strange man who identifies himself as Gustav and claims to be a relative of Andrew arrives to the wake, during which Hailey allows him to pay his respects. After uttering an apparent incantation in Hungarian, Gustav thanks Hailey for the opportunity and abruptly leaves.Sometime later, Sharon reveals to Hailey that Andrew had committed suicide by leaping from the roof of a church while he was shouting gibberish. The power cuts out again, plunging the building into darkness as the noises resume from the casket. At one point, the casket suddenly and noticeably jerks in her direction, terrifying her. Trying to leave, Hailey discovers the front doors are chained shut. Returning to the viewing room, she finds the casket tipped over, open, and empty. She is attacked by Andrew's reanimated corpse, but because the top of its head is missing, it cannot see her. Hiding behind the casket, she finds the top of Andrew's head. Hailey is able to temporarily distract Andrew by playing viewing room music via remote control, but Andrew's functional eyes lock onto her, allowing the rest of his corpse to find Hailey. As it attacks, the storm, which has escalated into a tornado, strikes the funeral home as the camera cuts out. After it passes, Hailey, having been possessed by Andrew's spirit, rises and crawls through the window and into the surrounding area.Holy Hell (Interlude 2)
Back in the framing story, the officers discover body parts strewn across the floor, mannequins in the toilet stalls, and upside-down crosses hanging from the ceiling of various rooms. Panicked, they plan to exit the building. As an unknown voice states, ""Forever starts right now"", a television begins to play footage from a bizarre laboratory.The Subject
Written and directed by Timo Tjahjanto
In Indonesia, a man wakes up to find his body gone and replaced by mechanical spider legs. He falls from his restraints and catches fire, which is soon extinguished by Dr. James Suhendra, a deranged scientist who desires to create a successful mechanical-human hybrid, using kidnapped humans as guinea pigs. He carries out a lobotomy on a young woman with the initials S.A. (referred to as 'Subject 99') using a circular saw, and sedates a restrained young man (referred to as 'Subject 98') after he wakes up early. Both experiments are successful; Subject 98 becomes a large robot with spring-powered blades for arms, and S.A. becomes a functioning cyborg that responds to speech. The rest of the tape is mostly presented from her point of view. James celebrates S.A.'s success as a news report states that a rash of recent disappearances are driving wedges between the police and the public. James is suspected of kidnapping his patients, and S.A.'s old self is shown onscreen; James remarks on how she still recognizes her old appearance.James attempts to wipe S.A.'s memories; S.A. wakes up during the procedure and hits James, before attempting to undo her restraints. James beats S.A. repeatedly with a metal tray, and her battery life drops before he is interrupted by a knock at the door; a team of heavily armored police officers have arrived to arrest James. James throws a blanket over S.A. as the officers break in as the tape cuts to the feed of Jono, the timid officer assigned with recording the raid. After the commander confirms that James is their suspect, the police shoot him dead, and begin hunting the lab for survivors. They discover S.A., and argue over whether she should be killed or kept alive as she is not classified as human anymore, despite technically being a survivor. A sudden blackout occurs in the lab, and Jono witnesses S.A. escape, but does not say anything.Another officer attempts to shoot the door lock and free the group, but triggers an explosion. As the group come to, an alarm begins to sound and James's contingency plan begins. Over a speaker, James states that his creation is his alone, and that those who try to take it from him shall die. Subject 98 awakens and slaughters most of the soldiers; Jono and the commander survive after the commander hurls a grenade at 98. S.A. comes to and flees through the building, being shot at by the surviving officers and chased by 98. She locks herself in a small office room and finds blueprints for her cyborg body and cannon arm, along with the upper half of her head and face preserved in a jar of formaldehyde. She approaches a mirror, and sees her new form for the first time; enraged, she punches the mirror and breaks it. After leaving the room and coming across more of James's failed experiments, S.A. finds and equips the cannon arm and fights her way through the building, slaughtering any soldiers she comes across in self-defense. She discovers Jono behind a door, and spares him after he begs for his life and promises to help her out of the lab. Suddenly, the commander appears and shoots S.A. before beating her; Jono grabs a gun and shoots the commander dead before being attacked by Subject 98. With her battery critically low, S.A. uses the last of her strength to tear out 98's brain, killing it. She collapses next to a heavily injured Jono, and her battery finally dies. The tape cuts to a security camera, which shows S.A. standing up on her own accord, escaping from the lab.Holy Hell (Interlude 3)
Back in the framing story, it is shown that Nash and Petro have killed Gary & kidnapped Spivey. As the rest of the team frantically search for him, Nash states ""Forever starts right now"". In front of a wall of TV screens, Slater pages his missing teammates over his radio, and Petro states that he should try not to lose his head. Slater suddenly collapses and enters a trance in front of one of the screens, which proceeds to display footage of a snowy, fortified militia enclosure.Terror
Written and directed by Ryan Prows
The First Patriots Movement Militia are a white supremacist extremist group that are currently plotting to blow up a local government building in a bid to ""take back America"". It is shown that they live in a well-secured compound in a deserted area somewhere in Detroit, Michigan. The compound has a room for security cameras, as well as a heavily protected small room covered in wooden crosses. In the latter room, a man is chained up and kept prisoner. Bob, the group's cameraman, Greg, the group leader, and Chuck, a group member, enter the room. The man pleads for his life, and Greg shoots him at point-blank range. The film cuts to one of the group's propaganda videos, where Greg explains that the group intends to purge evil from America.Members of the group set out in a car and drive past the building which they plan to blow up, surveying the site for security cameras and possible entry points. Back at the compound, Slater from the framing segment arrives to supply guns and ammunition to the group, asking if they have tested the ""creature"". It is shown that the group regularly shoot the man, who is revealed to be a vampire, and siphon his blood, which becomes explosive when exposed to sunlight, planning to use said blood instead of a bomb. Wanting to test if their plan works, they inject a rabbit with some of the vampire's blood and cage it; when the sun rises, the rabbit explodes. In celebration, the group drink heavily and party. Bob enters the compound and visits Steve, who is sitting in the security camera room. The pair visit the vampire's corpse, and Bob goads Steve into kissing it; the head falls forward and showers Steve in blood as Bob laughs.The next morning, an emergency bell rings and alerts the members of the group. Greg berates Jimmy, who was supposed to be on duty guarding the compound. Jimmy runs towards a body behind the truck, discovering it to be Terry, his neck having been badly gored. Suddenly, crashes come from inside the compound, and the group realizes they are missing Steve. Greg calls for Steve, just as a severed head is thrown out of the compound entrance as roars sound from inside. A member begins firing a truck-mounted machine gun on the compound, losing control due to the sway and killing some of the group in the process, and is shot in the head by Tom when he is unable to stop. Steve then stumbles out of the compound covered in the vampire's blood, promptly exploding once he steps into the daylight.The remaining members of the group - Greg, Tom, Bob and Jimmy - vow to kill the vampire. They enter the compound and discover the creature hiding in the attic; it tears Tom's face off and Greg shoots wildly at it. In the attic, the vampire kills Jimmy by slamming his head on the floor repeatedly, and Bob shoots at it, missing and shooting Greg in the leg. Bob is attacked by the vampire, dying after his face is bitten off. Greg, repeating the phrase ""Christ is king"" is dragged by the vampire into the cage. It then opens the attic window and lets in sunlight, causing the vampire to explode and the compound to be destroyed.Holy Hell (Epilogue)
The majority of the SWAT team are now dead, their eyes having been gouged out. Slater is tied to a chair by Petro and Nash, who rebuke him for supplying the militia in the previous video with guns. The women explain that they are members of the snuff/fetish film cult that has been operating out of the warehouse, where they create and distribute videotapes depicting animal cruelty, cannibalism and other shocking acts of violence. Slater is told that he will be their final kill for this video, whereupon Petro beats him to death with a video camera. As the film ends, Petro and Nash believe this will be their best tape yet, with the former wondering what to call it.

An avid geocaching fan, she wins a competition that earns her free tuition to a summer camp in the Catskills. Pili can't go in the end as they temporarily relocate from New York to Oahu with their mother Leilani to help her father, Kimo as his health and financial issues are becoming serious.As Pili is so into geocaching, her malaise at being separated from her beloved New York is assuaged by secretly liberating an old diary from her grandfather's art studio, set up in an old bus. Just as she's sneaking off the bus, she meets local boy Casper who helps cover for her.That night, as Pili is trying to secretly read the diary, E catches her. He explains the term Night Watchers to her, trying to scare her, explaining they are ghosts of fallen warriors who protect the island.Meanwhile, E is distracted from his own search for better Internet signal by local girl Hana, who is Casper's friend. She, on the other hand, is not impressed by his attitude towards the younger kids.In the diary of the ship the Peruvian's quartermaster Monks, he documented Robinson and Brown's excursion on the island. The privateers had mutinied, burned their ship and taken the treasure ashore. Monks stayed to protect the treasure while his superiors died. He gave the diary to Pili's ancestors for saving his life.Kimo catches Pili with the diary. Initially angry, he ends up taking the enthusiastic girl to see some of the landmarks in it. He falls, breaking a rib. While Leilani is distracted with Kimo in the hospital, Pili and Casper sneak off to seek the lost pirate treasure. E and Hana follow close behind.They end up having to follow the instructions in the diary as all four slide inwards of a cave too far to back out. They have to crawl through a narrow tunnel, it's opening is called 'The Jaws of Death' and it is lined with stalactites. Fearing a deadly spider, E hurries frantically out of the tunnel, leaving behind the ship journal as it's inside Casper's backpack as it collapses. Finding a mini rope bridge over a lava-filled crevice, they realize it's too deteriorated to cross, but the fearless Pili and Casper inch around it on a narrow ledge. E helps Hana maneuver around it, partially by distracting her singing a favorite song.E confides in Casper that the brown violin spider bit him, leaving him with a huge blister, possibly indicating necrosis. To not alarm the others, he covers it with duct tape. Arriving to a pool, they realise the next tunnel is filled with rain water. Pili gets through it piggybacking on E.Arriving at 'ground zero', Pili and Casper go in search of the treasure while E talks with Hana. He tries to convince her to send in her application to Julliard, but she fears it might change her too much. Pili and Casper examine the complex pulley and rope system they had remembered from the journal. Realizing one of the counterweights is down, they deduce they can access the treasure room by putting all of their weight on the severed rope.Once in, they all are collecting large amounts of gold and jewels, when Hana spots a religious statuette indicating they are in a type of tomb. Realizing the treasure is an offering, she insists they can't take anything without waking the Night Watchers. When E refuses to believe it, they awaken.All four drop their treasure and head for the pools below using the banyon roots. Everyone makes it, although E has to be resuscitated. As they move away from the mountain Leilani catches up with them. The Night Watchers approach them as they seek shelter in a shed. Pili makes an offering with a few treasures she'd kept. They are bowing down, averting their eyes when their father Kua steps out. He had died 11 years ago while enlisted. Leilani, Pili and E have a brief moment before Kua and the other Night Watchers disappear into the ocean.Leilani calls a family meeting and proposes they decide as a group if they all stay in Hawaii or Brooklyn.

Years later, her young daughter, Fortuna Esperanza ""Lucky"" Navarro-Prescott (Isabela Merced), has been living with her aunt Cora (Julianne Moore) and grandfather James (Joe Hart) in a city on the east coast. However, after Lucky lets a squirrel in their house and ruins her grandfather's campaign party (James is a railroad baron, who is now running for GOvernor of the state), she and Cora head to the western town of Miradero (James wont speak to Fortuna and asks Cora to take her away) where they will stay with Lucky's father Jim (Jake Gyllenhaal), whom Lucky has not really known of after the incident with Milagro, for the summer. On the train over, Lucky notices a mustang running with his herd, and goes to the back of the train to meet him. Upon arriving in Miradero, the pair meet local young riders Pru Granger (Marsai Martin) (who is a rodeo rider) (and her father Al (Andre Braugher)), and Abigail Stone (Mckenna Grace) (and her brother Snips (Lucian Perez), who has a donkey named Carrots). Abigail has a horse named Boomerang.
Fortuna is awkward with Jim, since she cant figure out why Jim abandoned her after the death of Milgaro. Fortuna finds her mother's old room in Jim's house.The next day, Lucky goes to a corral where she sees the same horse from before trying to be abusively manhandled by a man named Hendricks (Walton Goggins). Hendricks is an outlaw and had seen the mustang with his herd from the train (he was on the same train as Fortuna).
Lucky tells Jim and Cora about the horse, thinking he can be her new friend, but Jim does not want Lucky going near the horses after what happened to Milagro. Nonetheless, Pru and Abigail help Lucky win over the trust of the horse (Lucky entices the mustang with apples), whom she names Spirit. After a while, Spirit trusts Lucky enough to eat an apple she offers him, and allows her to pet him, sealing their bond.Lucky attempts to ride Spirit but he escapes from the corral and runs away, while Lucky is saved by Pru and Abigail after almost falling off a cliff. Jim finds and scolds Lucky for disobeying him. They go home arguing, making Lucky think he has given up on her. She sneaks out at night through the forest where she finds Spirit and his herd together, but are interrupted by Hendricks and his men, who capture all the horses but Spirit (who resists fiercely and is left alone by Hendricks) and take them in with a stolen train. Knowing Hendricks and his men are wranglers, who are taking the horses to a boat to be auctioned and worked to death, Lucky agrees to help Spirit rescue his herd. She enlists Pru and Abigail with their horses to embark on a journey to try and cut the wranglers off on their path by beating them to a water depot located beyond a summit called Heck Mountain (which is near impossible to cross on horseback, but allows them to shortcut the train to the docks, where Hendricks will load the horses on a boat). During the trip, Lucky builds up her relationship with Spirit, and becomes good friends with Pru and Abigail as they travel.
Their plan is to reach a water depot, where the train has to stop to refill its water, before Hendricks gets there and ambush the train.The girls reach the water depot the night before the wranglers are set to arrive, but Lucky wakes up the next day realizing the wranglers made it earlier than expected. Spirit desperately attempts to save his herd on his own, but gets taken in by the wranglers. Determined to save Spirit, Lucky and her friends follow the train to the docks, where the wranglers are boarding the horses onto the boat. The girls arrive too late to stop the boat from leaving, but they manage to save Spirit. Lucky and Spirit get on board the boat by leaping off the docks, and free the other horses and subdue the wranglers, with Spirit knocking Hendricks off the boat.

By 2042, the Alliance was formed and quantum propulsion technology allows humanity to travel beyond the solar system. Unfortunately, the Mars colony fails in 2281 and the Alliance controls the three colonies: Earth, Zafdie, and Ellora. Zafdie attempts to secede from the alliance in 2519; James Ford, The Blood General, drops a Q(uantum)-Bomb on the rebel colony, killing 70 million people. After learning the horrible atrocity of what Ford did, Dr. Lea Goss (romantic partner) leaves him and he becomes dishonorable discharged from the military. In space, the Sigea are an invasive alien species that invades and conquer other worlds. They can parasitically infect and control their hosts by forcing their victims to ingest a black fluid that turns the host into an agent of Sigea and operate with a hive mind.Main story:In the year 2524, the Vander Mining Corp was stationed at planet 4217LYA (Heracles System) when Captain Juda Saule (Eva De Dominici) reports of an alien encounter to the Alliance. On Earth, General Eron Ryle (Frank Grillo) gets the call of the alien contact and wants Dr. Goss and Ford in on the situation. At a local bar, Dash (Corey Large) was meeting with Ford (Bruce Willis) for a job when civilians picked a fight with the Bloody General when Commander Marcus Bleck (Costas Mandylor) appeared. Bleck requested his presence but Ford refused; he relented when Bleck mentioned he'll get reinstatement. At the McMillian Airfield, Dash tags along with Ford and have a meeting with Dr. Goss (Perrey Reeves) and Ryle about what happened in the Heracles System. Survivors of the Vander mining operation were sent to the airfield for debriefing, but Goss raised concerns. The survivors were under Sigea control and started killing security. The soldiers fought back and won, but at the cost of 53 lives. What happened to Vander and their base was considered an attack on humanity and the Alliance is to strike back; Operation: Cosmic Sin is a go. Ford, Ryle, Goss, Braxton, Bleck (Brandon Thomas Lee), Dash, and Ardene (Adelaide Kane) travels to Ellora by a Quantum Jump Gate to stop the Sigea.While entering Ellora, Ryle's suit gets damaged and presumed dead when he didn't make it with the team. Ford and Goss got separated from the group during entry and Bleck gets mortally wounded shortly making it to the surface. As the team struggle to take out their attackers, Elloran survivors aided them. Sol Cantos (C.J. Perry) was escorting survivors when she encountered the team. After verifying they're human, they agreed to help take them to the orbital cannon to give Bleck treatment. At the Alliance outpost, the surviving team learns about how the Sigea infect and control people. Ford made it to the outpost to find Bleck dying; he euthanized Bleck to help him die easier. In a meeting with all surviving soldiers, they talk about their situation and plan to use the Q-bomb they brought. Ardene believes if they can get the orbital cannon working again, they can launch the Q-bomb into space and collapse the gateway to seal off the Sigea once and for all. In space, Ryle was able to reach out to Ardene through the coms. With him stuck in space, he volunteered to help detonate the gateway to seal off the Sigea.The Sigea knows the survivors are holding up at the orbital cannon and converge on the outpost. Goss was captured and infected; she's now an agent of the Sigea. Goss gives them a chance to surrender, but they refused. The survivors along with the soldiers make their last stand, to hold up the outpost as long as possible for Ardene to fire the cannon. While the rest fend off the alien attackers, Ford latched on to a Sigea ship and followed Goss to the gateway. While facing Goss, she said there was never going to be peace. Ford was repelled back to Ellora while Goss drifted through the gate. At the cannon, Braxton found Ryle prepared to sacrifice himself to close the gate. Braxton held Ardene's hand as they fired the cannon and launched the bomb. Ryle's self destruction destroyed the gateway and the Q-bomb crossed over to Segia space and opened a black hole. The gate closed behind the blackhole, sealing and wiping out the Segia attack fleet. Back on Earth, Ford heads back to the bar for a drink along with the survivors of Ellora. Dash, Ardene, Braxton, and Sol Cantos survived the battle and the Alliance celebrates their victory for keeping the peace. Ford takes a shot and leaves the bar.",Seven rogue soldiers launch a preemptive strike against a newly discovered alien civilization in the hopes of ending an interstellar war before it starts.

She proceeds with the presentation, where she uses her pet squid Socrates' DNA on Uncle Fester to show how humans can be improved. The experiment is a success, but when Wednesday goes up to accept what she thinks will be a first place prize, she finds that everyone got a trophy for their efforts. Her work, however, gets noticed by scientist Cyrus Strange, who appears through a holographic projection to let her know he thinks her work is brilliant. Meanwhile, Pugsley attempts to impress girls by tweaking another kid's volcano project, but it ends up causing a huge disaster in the gym that sends everyone running.Back at the Addams home, Wednesday and Pugsley decline to show up for dinner. Fester goes up to Pugsley's room to try and help him find a way to woo the ladies. Wednesday sends her parents a very specific note for why she isn't coming to dinner. Gomez worries that the kids are drifting apart from him and Morticia, so he decides to take them on a family vacation.Gomez brings out a hideous road vehicle and gets Thing, Fester, the kids, and Lurch to join him and Morticia on the road while Grandmama stays behind to take care of the house. Before they hit the road, a lawyer named Mr. Mustela approaches Gomez and Morticia with the implication that Wednesday was switched as a baby at the hospital, meaning she may not really be an Addams, but the two ignore him and think it's just Wednesday trying to get out of going on the trip, but she says that she doesn't know who that man is. Once the family is gone, Grandmama throws a huge party. On the road, Mustela and his hulking henchman Pongo pursue the Addams family.The family is initially set on going to Salem, but Fester ends up making a detour to Niagara Falls because he is suddenly obsessed with water due to him mutating because of Wednesday's experiment with the squid. Pugsley tries to make another attempt with girls per Fester's advice, but his cheesy line backfires. Wednesday gets a voodoo doll of him and uses Pugsley to perform some dance moves, until she just tosses the doll over the Falls to torment her brother. When Gomez and Morticia attempt to bond with Wednesday, she snubs them. They then spot Mustela and Pongo looking for them, and Fester ends up knocking Mustela into the water before recovering Pugsley.The family then stops in Sleepy Hollow where they set up camp. While gathered around the fire, Gomez and Morticia bring up Mustela and his claims about Wednesday, so Fester mentions a story from the night Wednesday was born where he went into the delivery room to see her, but all the other babies were crying, so he employed an Addams family tradition of putting babies to sleep by taking them out of their beds and juggling them all, potentially mixing up many babies in the process. This only worsens Gomez and Morticia's fears that Wednesday was switched. Wednesday overhears the discussion and muses to Lurch about where she might really come from.Gomez brings everyone to Miami in an attempt to get in touch with Cousin Itt so he can help with their current dilemma. Itt joins them on the trip as they pass through San Antonio where he talks to Wednesday about his own rebellious phase in his youth, but he essentially says he owned up to who he really is. When Grandmama calls him to help with the house party since she let it get out of hand, Itt must bail. Mustela and Pongo almost catch up with them, but Lurch knocks them away.To hide from their pursuers, the family goes to a motel where they enter a displeased Wednesday into a girls beauty pageant where she creates a scene. Mustela enters, but is distracted long enough for the family to escape.The Addams' stop at the Grand Canyon where Itt flies off from them, and Morticia gives Wednesday a necklace containing the blood of the Addams family members. Pugsley blows up the canyon, drawing more unwanted attention. Meanwhile, Fester starts to mutate further into a squid-man. Wednesday goes off by herself where Mustela attempts to get her again, but she gets the drop on him and traps him. His phone rings, and she sees that he was employed by Cyrus Strange, who suggests to Wednesday that he is her true father and that he is inviting her to stay with him in Sausalito where she can hone in her potential in science. Wednesday runs a DNA test using Gomez's hair, which seemingly proves that she most certainly is not his daughter.Wednesday leaves the family while they sleep, but Lurch catches up with her to keep her safe. The rest of her family learns where she is headed and go after her. Wednesday and Lurch stop at a biker bar to ask for help in getting to Sausalito, which they do after Lurch shows off his piano and singing skills by performing ""I Will Survive"". The bikers then escort the two to Sausalito.Wednesday arrives at Cyrus's home and meets his wife Ingrid, a bird-like humanoid being, and their pig-like daughter, Ophelia. Cyrus brings her to his lab where he shows her a formula he developed much like Wednesday's own that she used on Fester regarding human-animal hybrids. The rest of the Addams clan shows up, but Wednesday seems fully set on staying with Cyrus and no longer accepting them as her family. While Gomez and Morticia are sad, Pugsley tries to bond with Ophelia since they seem to be mutually attracted. However, Ophelia morphs into a pig, as that is what she originally was. When Pugsley brings this revelation to his parents, Cyrus reveals the truth and that he was just using Wednesday since her formula works better than his own. He then captures the family.Cyrus traps the clan in tubes where he plans to mutate them with his formula. He shows them to Wednesday so that she may remove any traits of theirs that she doesn't like, but she doesn't like seeing them trapped this way. She turns on Cyrus, but when he tries to have Pongo go after her and Lurch, it is then revealed that Lurch and Pongo knew each other and were really good friends at the asylum they were locked up at before Lurch was found by Gomez and Morticia. Pongo warned Lurch with a look that Wednesday was in danger. Together, the two brutes free the Addams family and knock Cyrus into a tube where he is doused with his potion. It turns him into a gigantic animal hybrid monster. When he goes after the family, Fester comes out as a giant squid monster, and the two fight until they both tumble out the window. Cyrus falls to his death while Fester pulls himself up with his tentacle, but he is now weakened. Wednesday uses the blood in the necklace that Morticia gave her, and Fester turns back to normal and is revived. Wednesday decides she is proud to be an Addams and reunites with her family.The family returns home, with Ophelia joining them as a regular human girl, where Itt has helped Grandmama turn the party around. While Wednesday knows Cyrus fabricated the DNA test results, she wonders how her test came out so that she isn't related to Gomez. He reveals his hair is a toupee, but that she is 100% his daughter. The family then goes on another road trip around the world.","The Addams get tangled up in more wacky adventures and find themselves involved in hilarious run-ins with all sorts of unsuspecting characters.

While Irene identifies as African-American and is married to a black doctor, Clare ""passes"" as white and has married a wealthy white man. Clare invites Irene back to the hotel where she is staying with her husband, John, on his business trip. Clare explains that after her father died, she was raised by two white aunts and married him very young. They are interrupted by John, who openly despises and degrades African-Americans, unaware of his wife's racial background or that Irene is ""passing"" for the day. Despite this initial, awkward encounter, Clare reaches out to Irene to renew their friendship. After a delay, Irene accepts. As the two women reconnect, they become increasingly involved in each other's lives and insecurities. Clare admits that she misses the African-American background she has had to repress around John, and Irene invites her out to a jazz club with her own husband, Brian, and their friend Hugh. Hugh is unimpressed, but Irene notices obvious chemistry between Clare and Brian. They also discuss their past, and Clare insists that she was jealous of Irene's dependable and moral attitude, while Irene herself envied Clare's vivacious and free-spirited personality. Clare admits she is not like Irene, because she would do whatever it takes to get what she wants, even if it means hurting others. Meanwhile, Irene and Brian argue over how to parent their sons regarding racial issues, and Irene notices that Brian and Clare are becoming close to the point where her own sons are more excited to see Clare. After Irene stays home with the children so Brian can play bridge with Clare, and later defends Clare from a comment by Hugh, she becomes paranoid that they are having an affair, culminating in a fight between her and Brian. Irene attempts to cut off contact with Clare, but Brian foils this by inviting Clare to a tea party for Hugh. Irene drinks heavily and accidentally shatters an heirloom teapot after seeing Brian and Clare speaking intimately, though Hugh protects her in front of the guests. Irene waits anxiously for Clare to return to John and leave the city, but she continues to stay around Irene. When out shopping with her friend Felise, who does not pass as white, Irene encounters John, and hurries away when he begins to realize the truth about his wife's racial background. Though Irene tries to warn Clare, she relents. As the three leave to attend a party, Irene asks Clare what she will do if John ever finds out the truth. When she replies she would move back to Harlem permanently, Irene becomes unnerved and is silent for most of the evening. When she opens a window to smoke, she hears John angrily force himself into the party; as a calm Clare moves to join Irene, John bursts in and furiously declares her a liar. He lunges toward Clare as Irene puts an arm between them. Clare falls out of the window to her death. After some hesitation, Irene slowly goes downstairs to where the other guests are speaking with the police. Upon being questioned, Irene insists that Clare's fall was an accident. Brian seems to realize the truth and comforts Irene as she sobs.","""Passing"" follows the unexpected reunion of two high school friends, whose renewed acquaintance ignites a mutual obsession that threatens both of their carefully constructed realities."

During an operation, a team of United States Marines and ""Gumps"" (robotic soldiers) are ambushed. Disobeying a direct order, drone pilot 1st Lt. Harp deploys a Hellfire missile in a drone strike against a suspected enemy launcher, killing two of the Marines but saving the remaining 38. As punishment, Harp - who has never personally served in a war zone before - is sent to Camp Nathaniel, the US base of operations in Ukraine where he is assigned to Captain Leo, who reveals that he is secretly a highly advanced and experimental android super-soldier masquerading as an eccentric human military officer.Harp and Leo set out on a mission to prevent pro-Russian terrorist Victor Koval from gaining control of a network of Cold War-era nuclear missile silos, under the cover of delivering vaccines to a refugee camp. On the way, their convoy responds to a reported attack on a friendly aid truck, which results in a stand-off between the US Marines and armed locals. After a Gump ""pre-empts"" (read: shoots) a local who threw a rock at the Gump, Captain Leo manages to negotiate a peaceful solution to the confrontation by giving the locals the contents of the aid truck. However, pro-Russian insurgents ambush the gathered locals and US Marines, which leads to a firefight. This forces Leo and a nervous Harp to travel to the refugee camp on foot, while the US Marines remain behind to engage the insurgents.After arriving at the refugee compound, Leo and Harp are shot at by an insurgent using a sniper rifle, killing a few civilians, but missing them. Harp watches as Leo tortures the insurgent for information, before leaving him to be killed by the gathered mob, which disturbs Harp. Leo and Harp meet their contact Sofiya, a resistance leader, at an orphanage. She tells Harp that US drone strikes are responsible for the deaths of many of the orphans' parents, further unsettling him. Sofiya leads them to an arms dealer who knows the location of a bank vault containing nuclear launch codes that Koval is looking for. Harp and Leo travel to the bank, where they are met by Koval's forces which include several Russian-made Gumps. While Harp gains the courage to help rescue civilians caught in a crossfire between the Russian Gumps and a squad of US Gumps, Leo retrieves the codes but Koval is nowhere to be found. A drone strike called in by Harp destroys the bank and several surrounding buildings, leading the military command to believe both Koval and Leo are dead.Harp reunites with Leo who tells him that he has his own plans for the codes, and that he has been manipulating Harp into helping him escape the eye of the military command. He knocks out Harp and leaves him on the side of the road where he is picked up by Sofiya's men. Leo meets with Koval to give him the codes, but ends up killing him after Koval refuses to give Leo access to a nuclear missile silo under his control. Harp informs Sofiya and his commander of Leo's actions, and they realize Leo is planning to launch the nuclear missiles at the United States himself, in order to prevent the country from fighting more destructive wars in future. Harp volunteers to infiltrate the silo and finds Leo has taken over. He disables Leo but not before Leo initiates the launch of a missile and explaining that his true goal was for the android super-soldier program to end in failure. Harp escapes just as the silo is destroyed by a drone strike before the missile can launch; the resulting explosion kills Leo in the process. In the aftermath, Harp returns to Camp Nathaniel and receives praise from his commander, who then informs Harp that he is going home. In the final scene, Harp leaves the base.","In the near future, a drone pilot sent into a war zone finds himself paired with a top-secret android officer on a mission to stop a nuclear attack."

Due to his criminal record, he is unable to find additional employment to support his family, though Kathy offers to restart working to help make ends meet. After being physically harassed by NOPD officers Ace and Denny, the former being Jessie's absent biological father, Antonio is violently arrested. He is placed into ICE custody and faces deportation when it is revealed that his adoptive parents never naturalized him pursuant to Child Citizenship Act of 2000. Antonio and Kathy seek to appeal his deportation with the help of immigration lawyer Barry Boucher, who requests a $5,000 retainer. Barry warns, however, that if his appeal fails, he can never return to America again.
Antonio strikes up a friendship with Parker, a Vietnamese refugee with terminal cancer who came to America with her father when she was a child, and whose mother had died during the journey. After receiving a tattoo of ""Fleur-de-lis"" (a water Lily which references freedom - however never forget your roots as water lilies have roots but most people don't know this) from Antonio, she invites his family to a communal cookout at her home. Still unable to afford Barry's services, Antonio and his friends resort to stealing motorcycles and selling them, with Antonio nearly getting caught. Antonio pays Barry, claiming that the money was an advance from work, which Kathy finds suspicious. Barry tells Antonio that due to his criminal record and a lack of factors that would make his appeal favorable, his best chance is to seek support from his adoptive mother, who is still alive - something Antonio had hid from Kathy. Deeply hurt over this lack of disclosure and even more devastated by his refusal to contact his adoptive mother (due to her refusal to defend themselves against his physically-abusive adoptive father), she leaves with Jessie and moves in with her mother. Having begun to lose hope, Antonio severs his friendship with Parker.
Eventually, Antonio chooses to see his now-widowed mother, who appears apathetic and unwilling to appear for his trial. Antonio is fired by his boss at the tattoo parlor due to unpaid debts. He makes amends with Parker, whose cancer has gotten worse. When she falls unconscious, he takes her to the hospital. Kathy gives birth to her and Antonio's daughter, and they reunite. On the day of Antonio's hearing, Kathy, Jessie, Antonio's friends, Ace, and Antonio's mother, arrive to offer support. Antonio, unbeknownst to them, is abducted by Denny and his friends, who viciously assault him and leave him for dead. Knowing that he's guaranteed to be deported, Antonio attempts to commit suicide by drowning but cannot bring himself to do it. Denny brags to Ace about assaulting Antonio and making him miss his hearing, and Ace, disgusted, arrests him.
After saying his final goodbyes to his friends, Antonio is escorted by ICE to the airport for deportation to South Korea. Intending to go with him, Kathy and Jessie manage to locate him at the airport. Ace also arrives, wanting to say his farewells to Jessie, his daughter, before she leaves. Not wanting to displace his own family and not knowing where he'll be sent, Antonio tells them to stay in America. Unable to let go of an inconsolable Jessie, Antonio is forcibly separated from her as she cries out for him.
Real-life cases of other not naturalized adopted persons who are either facing deportation or have been deported are shown, along with the estimates by the ""Adoptee Rights Campaign of International Adoptees"" who face similar circumstances.","As a Korean-American man raised in the Louisiana bayou works hard to make a life for his family, he must confront the ghosts of his past as he discovers that he could be deported from the only country he has ever called home."

A man named Schuttmann and his son Derek are talking about a coworker who is not being safe. Derek is attempting to persuade his father to give their coworker another chance when he is suddenly attacked by an unknown creature. Schuttmann attempts to save Derek, but the creature stabs him in the shoulder, paralyzing him. A bloodied Derek is taken away as he screams.Years later, a team of scientists-Darren, Shawn, Terry, and Jaime-led by an adventurer named Arianne, are searching for Shookum Hills and its coal mine. The town hasn't been placed on maps since the 1970s, and its population has also seemingly vanished. It's believed that the disappearance is related to an underground coal fire that resulted in sinkholes opening up around the town. Darren, the team leader, believes that the fires were started by a rare mineral.The group stops at a store and Arianne goes inside to buy supplies and ask for directions to Shookum Hills. The proprietor claims that he has never heard of Shookum Hills; when Arianne presses the issue, he tells her to go back the way she came. As the team leaves the store, the proprietor warns an unknown party that there is a problem. As the team leaves the store, another car begins following them. Arianne successfully eludes the pursuers, and the team finds a dirt road blockaded by an electrical fence. They break through the fence and discover the abandoned Shookum Hills Mine. Though delighted by their find, they are puzzled to discover a sinkhole covered by an improvised electrified fence. They break through the barrier and lower sensors into the hole to establish a picture of the tunnels beneath. Terry is suddenly dragged into the sinkhole. Arianne and Jaime descend into the sinkhole to try and find Terry, but cannot locate him. Darren and Shawn are confronted by an angry local named Dale, who demands to know why they opened the sinkhole cover. Frightened, they knock him unconscious. Once Arianne returns, she tells them that there are monstrous creatures in the tunnels. The group flees into the woods, losing Shawn in the process. Dale is also killed, after reporting that the sinkhole has been breached. Darren, Arianne, and Jaime are rescued by a group of locals led by Schuttman, who used to own the mines. He reveals that the mines are home to monsters that are the true reason the town disappeared. The surviving townsfolk have remained behind to keep the creatures contained.Arianne volunteers to go back with two locals, Ellroy and Shelby, to show them the sinkhole they opened. Darren and Jaime choose to accompany her. The creatures ambush them, and Ellroy sacrifices himself to draw them off. The rest of the group escapes into the tunnels. Shelby also chooses to distract the creatures, telling Arianne and the two men to flee. Jaime attempts to kill some of the creatures with a grenade, only for one of them to attack him and knock the grenade out of his hand. He is killed when it detonates.Exhausted and distraught, Darren tells Arianne that this expedition was not to map out the geographical area as he had led her to believe. He is being paid by a coal mining company that wants the rare mineral in the caves. He refuses to go on and Arianne leaves, promising to bring help back. She reaches the surface, but is surprised and captured by one of the creatures, which knocks her out with a paralytic venom. She awakens briefly to see that she is on a raft being steered by one of the creatures, along with Shelby's corpse. When they reach the creatures' lair, she is reunited with Darren and Shawn, both of whom have also been captured. Shawn notes that the creatures are a species which breeds and colonizes like ants or bees. He is then fed to the queen creature, which is a bloated, immobile hulk. The creatures attempt to feed Arianne to the queen, but she recovers from the venom and uses a grenade Darren gave her to kill the queen.She and Darren escape and begin to climb up a rope at the entrance, but one of the creatures follows them and attacks Darren. Arianne gives him a knife to fight back, but the creature manages to poison him. He chooses to cut the rope instead, saving Arianne at the cost of his own life. The locals arrive, and one of them is about to cut the rope and doom Arianne, only for Schuttman to stop him and help her escape. The locals use a flamethrower and rifles to drive the creatures back into the tunnels. Afterwards Schuttmann is driving Arianne back to the outside of the fence.

The outpost is located in an unusually fertile forested area outside Bristol to help in the studies and experiments of his former colleague and ex-lover Olivia Wendle regarding using mycorrhiza to increase crop efficiency. After passing a physical examination and meeting his park guide Alma, he learns of the local legend of Parnag Fegg, a woodland spirit. The following morning, Martin and Alma begin their two-day hike toward Olivia's site.Alma informs Martin that Olivia has not been heard from in months. The pair come across an abandoned tent, with the remaining items indicating it belonged to a family. The next night, Martin discovers a rash on his arm before he and Alma are assaulted by unknown assailants who also raid their camp, destroy their equipment, steal their shoes, and loot some of their supplies. Without his shoes, Martin badly cuts his foot.They are approached by Zach, a man living in the woods who offers to lend the pair some shoes. Taking them to his own campsite, Zach disinfects and stitches Martin's wound and gives them both food and a drink. Martin and Alma begin to lose consciousness and realize they have been sedated. While they are unconscious, Zach takes ritualistic photos of them in strange clothes and positions and stitches a strange symbol and animal gut into Martin's arm.Upon waking up Zach describes the symbol as a mark to be seen by a presence in the woods, claimed by him to have once been an ancient sorcerer who placed his essence in a standing stone somewhere in the forest. Martin's foot becomes infected from his injury and Zach sloppily amputates some of his toes with a hatchet.Alma acquires a discarded blade to free herself and Martin before attacking Zach. Martin and Alma flee, but become separated. Zach pursues Martin, who stumbles across a pair of bodies, presumed to be the owners of the abandoned camp. After encountering the standing stone, Martin is found and rescued by Olivia. Alma independently makes her way to the camp, and Zach is driven away by the amplified sound and lights set up around Olivia's site.The next morning, Olivia cauterizes Martin's foot as she explains her project. She reveals that Zach is her ex-husband, and that the pair were following the directions of a centuries-old book on local legends. He had been helping her to try and communicate with the presence inside the stone, using the lights and noises from an electronic soundboard, but disapproved of her approach and left. Unable to trust Olivia and fearing that Zach is still after them, Alma tries to convince Martin that they need to leave, but he will not be drawn on the nature of his relationship with Olivia and she refuses to abandon her research.The next morning, the site is surrounded by a thick mist containing fungal spores, trapping them. They send Alma through the mist in a hazmat suit, but the spores make it through her protective clothing and subject her to horrifying visions. That night, the mist continues to close in on the site as Zach arrives, telling them to communicate with the standing stone using the sounds and lights as well as to consume a ""sacrament,"" a mixture of ground mushrooms alluded to in the book.Martin agrees to drink the sacrament and waits for it to take effect. Zach ambushes Alma and prepares to sacrifice Martin. Alma makes her way back to camp, where she finds Olivia in her tent surrounded by staged photographs of her and Zach's victims. Olivia attacks Alma, but she fends her off. Zach hears their struggle and rushes back to camp, where Alma kills him. She then pursues Olivia back to the standing stone as the mist overtakes the camp, and they are all subjected to more visions from the spores.By morning, Alma and Olivia suddenly find themselves far from the stone, broken out from their trances. Olivia, overcome with awe, collapses on the ground. Alma then approaches a waking Martin by the stone and, speaking with a distorted voice, she offers to guide him out of the woods.

Meanwhile, Alex's health deteriorates, with a wound on her palm frequently bleeding and failing to heal.In the spring, Alex and Jamie race to determine who will take the spot of a 1V Rower who has left the team due to a broken collarbone. Alex loses, sensing that the team was assisting the more popular Jamie by sandbagging while rowing on Alex's boat. Dejected, Alex begins to self-harm, while an infection from the wound on her palm begins to spread throughout her arm. Dani breaks up with Alex due to her increasingly destructive behavior and refusal to change.In the last week of the season, a challenge is set up to beat rower Highsmith's 14 minute record. While intended to be a friendly competition Alex, now fully a pariah within the team, publicly declares her intentions to break the record. The girls set off to row in individual boats on a dark hours of a cold early morning as a thunderstorm sets in. Alex collides her boat into Highsmith's and is thrown into the water, but climbs back on and continues rowing. The rest of the team starts to row back owing to the increasing severity of the storm but Alex persists despite their warnings.Alex finishes the race as a flash of lightning envelops her, and returns to the training building to the silent shock of her team members and coaches, erasing her name from the chalkboard and seemingly quitting the team. It is left ambiguous as to if Alex has beaten Highsmith's record.

They experience love at first sight, and Rita invites him out on a date. After many dates, the two of them get married, then buy a suburban house for them to live in. During their first year in the house, they give birth to their first child, a daughter named Lori, followed by four more daughters named Leni, Luna, Luan, and Lynn Jr. After they have five daughters, they give birth to their first son, an albino boy named Lincoln. After Lincoln, the two of them go on to have five more daughters named Lucy, Lana, Lola, Lisa, and Lily. In the present day (2017), Lincoln, who has become the family's ""man with the plan"" as he likes to call himself, teaches Lily how to create and execute a plan as they decide to be the first ones to eat their father's breakfast burritos. While their sisters end up getting ready before them, Lincoln is able to prevent them from further intervening in their plan by sending them out of the house against their will, noting how the key to having a plan is to always have a backup plan. After they begin eating their burritos, they soon learn that all of the girls have activities that day. Lincoln helps out his sisters, and they take home several awards after they finish their activities. That night, when the family goes out to eat, the girls pose for a group photo where they show off their awards. Lincoln attempts to join them in the photo because he is also part of the family and did plenty of work to help them, but he gets abusively shoved out of the frame and locked outside, and the public completely ignores him in favor of his sisters. This causes Lincoln to wish that he was special, and he decides to visit his best friend, Clyde. During the visit, Clyde talks about how he had recently taken a vacation to France, where he learned that he was descended from a long line of bakers and found out that he was just as skilled as his ancestors were. This inspires Lincoln to ask his family to take a vacation to their place of origin. After collecting a DNA sample from Lynn Sr., Lisa concludes that their family originated from Scotland, so the family takes a vacation there. Upon arriving in Scotland, they find themselves in a small town called Loch Loud, which, while still decently inhabited, is relatively dysfunctional and noticeably requires improvement. The Loud family soon learns that they are descended from royalty from a man named Angus, who works as the groundskeeper for their ancestral castle. After taking them to the castle, he introduces them to the castle's caretaker, Morag, who noticeably enjoys being in a peaceful and quiet setting more than anything. He then invites them to stay in the castle while on vacation, given that their ancestors lived in it. They accept the offer, and once they begin exploring the castle, Angus decides to talk to Lincoln after noticing his fascination with fame and recognition. He explains that the royal family was very special and well-known among the townspeople, but the most special of all of the Loud family's ancestors was Lincoln's double, who was the duke of the town. After being taken to the duke's room, Lincoln decides that he wants to be just like his ancestor. Suddenly, Lynn and Lana arrive in the duke's room, having noticed the cave near the castle with a prominent dragon motif, and ask Angus to explain why it exists. While Angus takes the two girls to the cave, he explains that dragons are an important part of the town's history, and the royal family owned a real dragon back in their time. Soon, he discovers that the only dragon egg left in the cave has hatched, meaning that a dragon is on the loose. After they catch up with the dragon, they bring it to the castle, where Lily names it Lela. Suddenly, Lincoln emerges from the duke's room, wearing the duke's clothes and having decided that he wants to become the duke. At dinner that night, Angus explains that the only way Lincoln can become the duke is by making an effort to help out the townspeople. The next day, Lincoln helps out the townspeople (with help from Angus, as he needed to learn along the way that being the duke is about more than being popular and self-entitled), which manages to convince them that he would make the perfect duke. However, Morag, who wants to regain her peace and quiet after the Loud family leaves, blurts out that Lincoln is a tourist, which causes the town's citizens to abandon him. Lincoln then convinces his family to move into the town, which they agree to after being manipulated by him, and he is later crowned as the duke. Soon, as Lincoln is enjoying himself, living as his ancestor did four hundred years before him, Morag sneaks away from the castle to the highlands, where she completely snaps and openly expresses her hatred for the Loud family. She then digs up her distant ancestor, Aggie's, journal, where she uncovers a dragon-controlling gem. She plots to use it to exile Lincoln from Scotland, just as her ancestor did to her duke. That night, Lucy summons the ghost of her distant ancestral double, Lucille, who explains the true story of the royal family's departure from Loch Loud: They left for a temporary amount of time, but upon returning, the duke's dragon friend, Lolo, attacked their ship. Lucille had assumed that Lolo had deemed her brother, the duke, to be worthy no more, and he thus handed over his crown before sending them all away to a new land. What none of them knew was that Aggie, the castle's historical caretaker, was controlling the dragon with a gem, and she had plotted to exile the duke from Scotland out of frustration for never getting a moment of peace and quiet as a result of the large royal family's presence. After Lucille finishes explaining the story of the royal family's departure, Morag arrives back at the castle, then eavesdrops on Lincoln, where she learns that his greatest weakness is being stuck in his sisters' shadows. She then decides to motivate him to abdicate the throne, then usurp the throne and become the duchess. The next day, she invites Lincoln's sisters to perform in front of the town, since their ancestors were widely known for their many areas of expertise. While Lincoln is cleaning out chimneys throughout the town later that day, he notices a flyer promoting his sisters performing in the town, which causes him to lose his confidence about being special and popular due to his royal status. Morag then convinces him to ride the dragon like his ancestor once did, and Lincoln agrees to the offer. Sure enough, the townspeople admire Lincoln as he rides the dragon, but during his dragon ride, Morag takes control of the dragon using the gem she found in Aggie's journal. With Morag now in control of the dragon, property destruction ensues throughout the town, and the townspeople blame Lincoln for it. They later form a mob against him, which motivates him to abdicate the throne and leave Scotland. After the Loud family leaves Scotland, Morag usurps the throne and becomes the duchess. Angus and the townspeople begin opposing her because this action is unlawful (as the Loud family did not give her consent to become the duchess after they left, as she claimed soon before her coronation), and not wanting to be opposed, Morag attacks the town using the dragon. Meanwhile, Lucille learns from Aggie's journal that Aggie betrayed the royal family back in their time and was responsible for the original duke abdicating the throne, and she soon reveals the truth to the current Loud family. After telling them that Morag is attacking the town and sending all of its residents into exile, they return to the town and battle against her. Lincoln soon confronts Morag face-to-face and begins to battle for the crown. However, they lose focus of where the dragon (which they are standing on) is going, and they crash through the castle walls. Morag prepares to kill the entire Loud family and Angus, but Lincoln is able to prevent this by attracting Morag away from them by taking the crown with him. During Morag's last-ditch effort to murder Lincoln, Lincoln uses a magic trick to replace the dragon-controlling gem with a burrito, then destroys the gem so Morag cannot control the dragon anymore. After another fight over the crown, they fall off a cliff, but the dragon manages to prevent them from dying. The dragon takes Lincoln back to the castle, but leaves Morag stranded on an island populated by noisy seals. After Lincoln arrives back at the castle, he decides that he does not deserve to be the duke and instead decides to crown Angus as the duke, since he knows the town better than anybody else. After doing so, the Loud family helps to rebuild the town together with Angus and the ghosts of their ancestors, then they leave Scotland to return back home, satisfied with how they have helped the town.","With his parents and all 10 sisters in tow, Lincoln Loud heads to Scotland and learns that royalty runs in the family in this global musical journey."

The new revelation disturbs her peace, as she doesn't want to become a mother at this age. Sam tries to console Georgia and asks her to marry him, but she is unsure about the relationship.
Georgia decides to hide the secret from her parents (Father (Jon F. Merz) & Mother (Tamara Hickey)). In a hurry, she leaves behind her phone and walks out of the house to attend a college Christmas party. An android, Eli (Stephen Thorne), owned by the Olsens, wishes Sam happy Halloween instead of Christmas, thus signaling that something is wrong.At the party, people hear a shrill screech, similar to a technical glitch, and soon after, an android named Daniel (Liam McNeill) turns violent. He attacks Georgia and Sam, and they run away from the house. Due to the glitch, smartphones start exploding, killing their users. On the streets, Georgia and Sam witness the doom.
The androids launched an EMP attacks to bring down all electronic defenses and destroyed NYC.
Nine months later, Georgia, expecting her baby, has taken shelter in the forest with Sam. The couple are trying to get to a fortified Boston. They have heard rumors about a boat that is transporting new mothers to Asia, where they can find a peaceful life. Boston is surrounded by a no-man's land full of Androids.They avoid all roads and travel through the woods, until they reach a military camp. While Georgia gets examined by a Doctor Howe (Kate Avallone) (who informs her that the baby is way past due and that Georgia should not be travelling at all) (The doctor also tells Georgia that the boats are now only taking babies and mothers, no fathers due to scarcity of food for the crossings), Sam tries to find out how to reach Boston. Georgia wants to deliver at the camp, where they have shelter, but Sam says that crossing the no man's land with a baby will be impossible, so they need to get into Boston before the baby arrives.At night, he gets into a fight with one of the soldiers (The soldiers were high and, in a campfire, when Sam inquired about a ride to Boston. A convoy was going up to Nashua the next day, but one soldier challenges Sam to a fight for that ride), and he and Georgia are expelled from the camp the next day (Sam busted the soldier who is going to blind in one eye). They continue on, until they find an abandoned house, where they spend the night. They can travel way up north and find a boat back into Boston Harbor. This is safe but will take 2 weeks. Or they cut straight through No Man's land for 20 miles and reach Boston within 2 days. Sam finds a motorcycle and fixes it up.
Sam wants to go straight through even though the bike will create noise and attract attention from Androids. Sam argues that once the baby arrives it will be noisy as well, so they may as well take their chances now.The following day, the couple are able to travel much quicker on the bike. While stopped at a river, they are spotted by an android, who pursues them. Soon, several more androids give chase, accompanied by drones. Sam drops off Georgia and tries to lure the androids away on the motorbike. Meanwhile, Georgia meets a camouflaged man who offers to help her. He turns out to be an AI programmer who tells her that the androids have learned to hack their own software. He introduces himself as Arthur (Raúl Castillo).
Arthur tells Georgia that Androids want to wipe humans off Earth and warns her to forget Sam. Arthur is very emotional about Georgia's coming baby.In the morning, Georgia awakes to contractions. She tells Arthur that she needs to find Sam, and he leads her to where her partner is being held. They approach a building patrolled by androids, from which cries of pain can be heard. Arthur gives Georgia a camouflaged vest, which he claims will conceal her. She walks through the building, looking for Sam, unseen by the androids. She finds him in one of the rooms, with his legs badly broken. While she is freeing Sam, another prisoner tries to draw the attention of the androids. Georgia drags Sam out into a large garage. She collapses from contractions, and just as they are about to be apprehended, Arthur intervenes, stabbing an android and saving them. Georgia goes into labor in Arthur's truck. She wakes up in a hospital clinic, with Sam beside her. A nurse informs her that the C-section delivery went well, and that they have a baby boy. The couple name their son Forest.
Sam has had both of his legs amputated.Later, Georgia gets questioned by a security officer. She tells him what she and Sam have been through and mentions the vest that allowed her to avoid detection by androids. The officer tells her that such technology doesn't exist. Georgia then realizes that Arthur is an android and that he deceived her to gain access to Boston. Within moments, the power goes out, and the base comes under attack. Georgia tries to wake up Sam, to no avail. She heads down to try and activate the base perimeter and is confronted by Arthur. She shoots him in the face repeatedly, killing him. She manages to activate the EMP pulse, thereby killing all the Androids and returns to Sam.When Georgia wakes up again, Sam is up, and together with Forest, they head to the harbor, where Korean officer (Hana Kim) are loading a boat headed to Korea. They are only able to take Forest, however, as Georgia and a legless Sam are useless to them (they are another mouth to feed and in Korea they will need a job and a house). After pleading with them to no avail, Georgia is convinced by Sam to let Forest go and have a better life.","In a post-apocalyptic world rocked by a violent android uprising, a young pregnant woman and her boyfriend desperately search for safety."

(Forest Whitaker), her brother Cecil (Leroy McClain), and her sisters Erma (Saycon Sengbloh) and Carolyn (Hailey Kilgore) in Detroit, Michigan. C.L., pastor of the largest Baptist church in Detroit, frequently entertained large parties of friends and acquaintances at home. CL is divorced from his wife Barbara.
The predatory actions of an adult friend of the family, coinciding with the sudden death of her mother, Barbara (Audra McDonald), traumatizes Aretha. She ceases to speak for weeks, until her father demands that she sing in front of their congregation at church. She does not reveal that she was assaulted, nor does she reveal the name of the man who caused her to become pregnant.Seven years later, Aretha, now a teen mother of two boys. she is touring with CL, supporting Martin Luther King, in mobilizing support for his movement, by singing songs. She meets Ted White (Marlon Wayans), a local producer, at a party at her father's house. The two strike up a conversation before being interrupted by C. L., who warns Ted to stay away from his family. Later, C. L. surprises Aretha with tickets to New York for a meeting with Columbia Records executive John Hammond (Tate Donovan). After being offered a contract, Aretha begins to sing jazz records with Columbia, including ""Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive.""Four albums later, Aretha still lacks a signature hit as a jazz singer. In a club one evening, she announces she will be singing a tribute to inspiration and longtime family friend Dinah Washington (Mary J. Blige), who is in the audience; as Aretha begins to sing one of Dinah's songs, Dinah becomes outraged and makes a scene. Later, Dinah advises Aretha to find songs that move her, and stop trying to fit the polished image her father wants her to project. Aretha has had 4 albums so far, but no hits.Aretha connects again with Ted, with whom she begins a relationship. Frustrated by her lack of success after nine albums, Aretha begins skipping recording sessions to see him, embarrassing her father. Much to the chagrin of her sisters and the dismay of their father, Aretha returns home to introduce Ted to her family. After Ted and her father have a verbal disagreement, Aretha announces her plans to have Ted become her manager; her father begrudgingly consents. But he vows never to manager her career again.Two years later in 1966, Ted and Aretha marry and have a child. Aretha is dropped by Columbia (as she has gone 9 albums without a hit). Ted secures a deal with veteran record producer Jerry Wexler (Marc Maron) of Atlantic Records, who pairs her with accomplished musicians in Muscle Shoals, where Aretha begins to record her first hit, ""I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)"". However, the recording session is cut short after Ted gets into a fight with the manager of the studio. The studio is made up of all white musicians and Ted believes that they are insulting to niggers and are hitting on Aretha.
After an altercation with Ted results in a black eye, Aretha returns home to Detroit. With her family, she hears her own song recorded in Muscle Shoals on the radio, empowering her to take a more hands-on role in her career. She places a call to Jerry Wexler, telling him she is ready to work. One night, Aretha and Carolyn are inspired to re-arrange Otis Redding's song ""Respect,"" which becomes a #1 single. Aretha enters her golden years in 1968. She owns the category of soul music.Before a concert, Dr. Martin Luther King (Gilbert Glenn Brown), a longtime family friend of the Franklins, honors Aretha with an award from the Southern Christian Leadership Center for Aretha's unwavering support of the Movement and proclaims February 16 as ""Aretha Franklin Day"" in Detroit. Aretha sings another signature hit, ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman."" She makes plans to sing for another civil rights event one weekend in Memphis, which Ted forbids her to do, as he had arranged for her to meet with Wexler and other executives to discuss the prospect of a tour In Europe to whip up appetite for her upcoming album. Aretha openly defies Ted, and he assaults her in a hotel elevator. Jerry promises her a payday of $250k from the tour. But Ted is hostile, as he wants Arethe to consider TV and movie deals in the US, that don't pay nearly as much.
The tour goes ahead. Ted is nothing but an obstacle as he objects to every little thing on tour. In Europe, Time magazine publishes an article depicting Ted's abuse towards Aretha, witnessed by guests and staff in the hotel lobby, an angry Ted confronts Aretha, causing her to end their relationship.After the breakdown of her marriage to Ted, Aretha begins dating her tour manager Ken Cunningham (Albert Jones), and eventually has her fourth child. Another seven years later, after learning of Dr. King's assassination, Aretha's distraught father drunkenly argues with her over the direction of the Movement, expressing doubt in the younger generation's patience and ability to make long-term gains. Aretha expresses her full support of the Movement, and C.L., further angered, tells Aretha that she no longer walks in the spirit.Aretha continues to release hits but overworks herself to the point of burnout: she double-books and cancels appearances, and copes with the pressure of her profession by increasingly turning to alcohol and drugs. Aretha's siblings attempt to stage an intervention, but Aretha suspects they are jealous, and angrily tells them they are supported by her success. During another overseas performance, a drunken Aretha falls from the stage, and Ken tells her he can't be with her anymore. Aretha continues to tailspin downward, finally hitting bottom during a drinking binge at home. She sees a vision of her late mother, who consoles her, and she finds the strength to quit drinking, leading to Ken reconciling with her.Aretha becomes convinced that she must return to her gospel roots, and approaches Wexler with the idea of creating a gospel album, which she wishes to produce herself. Doubtful of the album's ability to sell, Wexler attempts to dissuade her before relenting on the condition that she allow the recording of the album to be filmed for a documentary.Aretha begins rehearsals for her gospel album with family friend James Cleveland (Tituss Burgess), now a respected gospel artist. On the day of the album's recording, Aretha's father arrives to be a part; he apologizes to Aretha for the pain he has caused her. The service begins and Aretha is introduced. As she makes her way to the front of the church, she greets each of her family members - but does not acknowledge her father.

tt8482584,8661,10,1,6.9,"['History', 'Sport']","['depression era', '1930s', 'football team', 'football game', 'football movie']",https://www.imdb.com/video/vi234995737/,"['Luke Wilson', 'Vinessa Shaw', 'Wayne Knight']",['Ty Roberts'],"Football Coach Rusty Russell (Luke Wilson) believed that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. He believed in himself and in 12 Mighty Orphans, who, against all odds, went on to play the Football State Championship in 1938. The film fables the exemplary tale of misfits and forgotten children who became the mighty orphans, the classic underdogs.
The film shows the Texas High School State Championship, 1938, where the Orphans play against the Sandies. After a devastating half-time, the narrative rolls back to 6 months earlier.War Hero Rusty Russell (Luke Wilson) arrives in Fort Worth, Texas, with his wife Juanita (Vinessa Shaw) and young daughter to join The Masonic Home. Rusty takes the job of new math, science teacher, and football coach in the Orphan School. While Juanita is hired to teach English. Warden Frank Wynn (Wayne Knight) welcomes the new teachers and gets them accustomed to the school.
Rusty soon learns of the ongoing horror in the school. Warden Frank physically assaults kids to compel them into child labor to fill his own pockets. The orphan boys lack education and are unaware of their own freedom of expression. With the help of the school's physician, E.P. Hall ""Doc Hall,"" (Martin Sheen) Rusty fosters a football team. Rusty believes that the game will bring self-respect and passion to these boys roaming like aimless chickens indulging themselves in an abyss of manual labor.What lays ahead is a series of hurdles in the Orphans' pursuit towards the state championship.
Warden Frank Wynn did everything in his power to stop the orphans from playing football. He feared that the game would bring passion in the aimless boys who would prefer to spend time on the field instead of his printing workshop.
Warden Frank was a hard nut to crack, but the boys themselves were the first hurdle in Rusty's journey. They were hard-boiled and untrained and only a bunch of hooligans to begin with. Fortunately, Rusty and Doc Hall knew how to melt down the boys' egos and train them appropriately. Looking at their zeal, Rusty applied for their admission in ""the Interscholastic League."" However, the new rules stated that all players were required to take a basic aptitude test. Rusty took that as a challenge and taught the unschooled boys. To his surprise, only 12 Orphans passed the aptitude test, and thus Rusty was obliged to make a team of only 12 players. To fill the gap in the group, all the players had to play both ways, which was pretty endearing and courageous. Players include Snoggs (Jacob Lofland), Chicken (Sampley Barinaga), Wheatie (Slade Monroe).
The boys trained passionately without shoes, football, and proper equipment, and Rusty left no stone upturned to transform them into mighty warriors. He gets the girls wing to stitch uniforms and helmets for his players. Now, it was time to test their mettle in their first football match.The Mighty Orphans played their first match against their rival Polytechnic or ""The Poly Parrots"" in 1938. Though they lost the game to the Ploys, the Orphans were just warming up. They took the Texas Football Circuit by a blitz and became the Classic Underdogs in the middle of the Depression.
Rusty's orphan team players were slim, short, and none crossed the required weight of 200 pounds. Rusty coined a spread offense technique (with a new position called the quarterback) to make up for their limitations that later gave him ""hall of fame"" recognition in Texas Sports Hall.
The Mighty Orphans were on a winning spree and soon came across their nemesis ""Polytechnic"" again in the Regional Semi-Final. The orphans won the game and entered the state championship, but casualties were fatal to their future efforts. One of their key players, Fairbanks (Levi Dylan), procured severe injuries due to which he never played football again.The orphan team had to play the state championship with only 11 players.
Before the semi-final match, Warden Frank Wynn shared some confidential documents with Polytechnic team captain Luther Scarborough (Lane Garrison). But Luther didn't use this secret weapon until Mighty Orphans won the game against his team. While the orphans were celebrating, UIL accused Orphans team of age violations, mainly lying about their star player Hardy Brown's (Jake Austin Walker) age. They were suspended from the championship, and the Polytechnic team was given their place.According to Hardy's birth certificate submitted to the president of UIL, Rodney Kidd (Scott Haze) (coincidentally, Luther's brother-in-law), Harden Henry Brown was born on September 4th, 1920. As per his age, in 1938, he was deemed ineligible to compete at the high school level. But at the UIL assembly, Hardy told them that the birth certificate belonged to his older brother, who died a week after he was born. Mistakenly, Warden Frank gave the wrong birth certificate to Luther in his pursuit to destroy the Orphan Team. However, even after the revelations, Rodney refused to alter his decision until he got a call from President Roosevelt, who took an active interest in Mighty Orphan's journey.
Finally, 12 Mighty Orphans got a chance to play in the state championship, and they traveled to Amarillo to unleash their hard work. In the meantime, Warden Frank was arrested by the sheriff for violating child labor laws, and his illegal printing press was closed by the principal.In Amarillo, the narrative jumped on to follow the match after half-past time. Sandies were leading with 7 points, while orphans didn't score any. It was a tough fight against the Sandies, who were incredibly huge and robust for the Orphans. The orphans bled and got injured, yet they didn't give up. They used their ""Snoggs Special"" passing technique against the furious bulls of Sandies. But even with such endeavor, Hardy, who had the last chance to score, failed to touch the goal. Six Golden Sandies piled up on Hardy Brown to stop, and alas, they succeeded. The Mighty Orphans lost the match, though what they won that day couldn't be described in words. It was a belief in themselves that would go on to last their entire lives.A rolling credit sequence gives away the life of prominent characters of the film after their state championship match. Rusty's legacy as the greatest coach in Texas still lives on. The famed Hardy Brown is still known as one of the toughest men in the game. A single man's vision touched so many lives with a single pursuit, and one couldn't be thankful enough for an inspiring tale of their efforts.","Haunted by his mysterious past, a devoted high-school football coach leads a scrawny team of orphans to the state championship during the Great Depression and inspires a broken nation along the way."

Batman follows Catwoman to Falcone's cash stockpile. Based on a coin flip, Dent decides to burn the money rather than move it legally. In retaliation, Falcone hires San Ho Hui Triad member, Mickey Chen, to bomb Dent's house. Both Dent and his wife Gilda survive, but Dent is hospitalized.Batman chases Chen down to the sewers, where Chen runs into Solomon Grundy. Batman convinces Grundy to spare Chen and takes Chen to the GCPD. Lacking evidence of his involvement in the bombing, Batman and Gordon are forced to release him. Gordon advises Batman to learn more about being a detective.On Thanksgiving, Falcone reminds his son, Alberto, that he will never inherit the family business. Dent escapes from the hospital and meets Gordon, who gives him a gun for protection. After Chen and his associates are killed by Viti's murderer, Gordon and Batman question Calendar Man in Arkham Asylum on the identity of the murderer, who is now coined ""Holiday."" Calendar Man names Falcone, Sal Maroni, and Dent all as suspects. He then says that Batman's war on crime is a ""joke,"" and Batman realizes the Joker has escaped from Arkham.Not wanting Holiday to replace him as Gotham's most notorious criminal, Joker confronts Dent in his home and threatens to kill Gilda if Dent is proven to be Holiday. Maroni advises Batman that if Joker is Holiday, he will inevitably target Falcone himself. On Christmas Eve, Joker harasses Falcone, warning him to divulge any new information about Holiday to him. Falcone's bodyguard, Milos Grappa, chases Joker out of the building but is killed by Holiday.In the Batcave, Batman identifies Maroni, Falcone's sister, Carla Viti, Joker, Falcone, and an unnamed figure, implied to be Dent, as suspects.Bruce Wayne attends a New Year's Eve yacht party celebrating Gotham's children's clinic, hosted by Falcone, who calls out Bruce during his speech as the son he never had. Bruce meets with Selina Kyle, who calls off their relationship due to their conflicting secret identities.Joker attempts to gas Times Square from a stolen plane, hoping that Holiday is among the crowds. After Batman foils Joker, he returns to the yacht and accuses Alberto of being Holiday, targeting his father's associates to gain power within the family. Alberto argues he only ever wanted to live his own life, rather than being controlled by his father. The latter had previously rejected Alberto's fiancée from Oxford.As the New Year hits, Alberto is shot by Holiday and falls into the bay, where he is cut to pieces by the propellers. Batman pursues Holiday, but Holiday escapes the yacht. As the yacht is evacuated, Gordon and Dent meet with Batman. He tells them to assign a protective detail to Falcone and vows to be a better detective.In the post-credits scene, following Alberto's funeral, Falcone requests Bruce's help laundering his money, but Bruce refuses. Falcone then introduces his associate, who shakes Bruce's hand while vines emerge from her sleeve, and Bruce's eyes turn green.","Held hostage by the powerful Falcone crime family, Gotham City is rife with crime and corruption. Adding to the chaos is the mysterious Holiday killer, who has been targeting the underworld and leaving a trail of terror - and body bags."

He brings some of the food that was brought to his house to the church.Gio's cousin Leo is riding with Uncle Ricardo. They see a man with several bikes and Ricardo asks him if those are his bikes. When the man doesn't give a satisfactory answer, Ricardo stops the car, chases the man and beats him up.Gio lights a candle and talks to Father Kelly, who asks what happened to him. Gio says some Russian guys at school beat him up. After a conversation with Father Kelly, he leaves the church. The weather forecast says snow, but Gio isn't dressed for it. Leo gets out of Ricardo's car when he sees Gio and gives him a jacket. Leo and Gio walk together and when they run into the Russian guys, Leo gives Gio a gun and some of them run away, but another one does not.Ten years later Gio is getting dressed up for a family celebration. Christmas decorations are up everywhere, but that's not the only reason for the celebration. Sofia doesn't want to go, even though the tenth anniversary of her husband's death is being observed. She does, however, give Gio the birthday cake she always makes each year. Sofia also comments on how Leo has done so much for them but he isn't doing what he should to keep in touch with other family members. She also criticizes Uncle Angelo for not keeping in touch with the family. Sofia insists Gio stop by the church that night to light a candle.Occasionally, Father Kelly's voice is heard explaining important details. His first time, he says Leo did time and now he is out, and his help for Gio and his mother came from being a dirty cop.Two tough looking guys confront Gio. One got out of an HVAC repair van which appears later. Gio calls Leo on his cell phone saying the FBI is looking for him.Gio was told to bring butter to the family celebration. When he stops at a bodega, a punk rocker type is making trouble, and then he is told by a store employee that the employee's father was threatened because he wouldn't sell the store. Now the refrigerator isn't working. Gio can't get butter.At a bar where Leo is supposed to be, Peeno is outside taking a smoke break, and a group of women having a party goes out to a limo. One is wearing a bridal veil. Later, one member of the group gets angry she was left behind. Gio and Peeno have a conversation where Peeno points out some suspicious guys.Gio stops by Leo's place but Leo isn't there. Very loud rap music is playing and a dog in a cage is barking. Then Peeno comes in with some Puerto Ricans who are looking for Leo and they intend to do something to him. Leo hides and Peeno sees him but doesn't say anything.Gio's best friend Tommy has a bakery and Gio stops there. Tommy has an attitude and suggest he hates everyone, including Gio. His partner Diane is nicer, and when she sees the cake decides it needs a box. Gio explains it is his father's birthday, but Diane didn't realize Gio's father is dead. Gio later asks Diane out. Tracey shows up after the bakery closes, and when she and Tommy get in a car driven by a Puerto Rican, they offer to let Gio go with them. The driver is annoyed by Tommy's references to the bad Puerto Ricans, but Tommy doesn't care.At a strip club, Gio has a conversation with Uncle Tony, and Cousin Joey makes trouble.Gio arrives at a nice house and everyone is glad to see him, and the cake. As Father Kelly explains, Uncle Angelo has given parties for people in the neighborhood and he is well-liked, though he was shot and now has trouble talking. Subtitles are necessary to understand Uncle Angelo as he speaks with an electrolarynx. Gio says hello to Uncle Carmine, who is on oxygen and watching ""A Christmas Carol"", and won't even acknowledge he has a visitor.Uncle Ricardo demands to know about Leo and pulls a gun when he doesn't get an answer. He is asked to leave, even when he protests that he is a cop and allowed to have a gun. When some mysterious men show up, it is explained to Gio that it is boys' night because all the women are at a bachelorette party. The family has a nice meal and Vito toasts Gio's father, who is depicted as a saint.A close-up of the box with the cake is accompanied by ominous music, as if the box contains a bomb. Later, someone realizes the cake needs to be served. Gio declines to eat since he is allergic to chocolate. The knife to cut the cake is passed from one man to the other with that ominous music again. The other men eat and they end up getting very sick. Gio realizes they are all dying, and after speaking to Uncle Carmine, who makes an offensive remark, Gio runs out and heads for Leo's place.The Puerto Ricans and the dog are dead. Ricardo has gun on Leo, who is in a bathtub covered with blood and looking frightened, and Ricardo is demanding information. Gio fights Ricardo and tries to save Leo but it is too late.Gio returns to the church very upset.

Space mechanic David, played by Thomas Jane, is in space repairing a satellite. For unknown reasons, he is not anchored/tied to the satellite when it is struck by a space storm that causes him to be hurdled into space. There is no sign, before or after the storm strike, of the ship or station he was on so you are left wondering, how did he get there and where has he been living while in space. He spends the rest of the movie floating through space, questioning God, talking to the on-board AI program, and leaving a voice recording for his young daughter Emma.Story 2: The End Of The Line
An android dealer is trying to sell his stock of used androids. He has a young woman customer who he shows his Charlie android. Charlie, played by Rupert Everett in bad old man makeup, is 60 years old and was used as a companion to old people at the end of their life. Charlie is awkward and makes the young woman uncomfortable with his bad dad jokes and off-putting sense of humor. She passes on buying him. The android dealer is frustrated trying to sell his used stock and in the end, decides to euthanize Charlie robot by crushing it in an industrial steam press type machine. Charlie android is feeble, fragile, stiff, and has to be helped getting up like a typical old person so why anyone thought he would be a good helping robot to humans is beyond me! The story ends.Story 3: Alexa God
A young woman in her mid 20s lives a boring, wasted life where she literally only wakes, talks to her Alexa with a God complex, gets charged $25.99 for each idiotic sin such as swearing and being envious of a neighbor who lives life freely, etc. She wakes one day to find the God Alexa has stopped working. This is due to the space storm strike but you as the viewer had to come to that conclusion as it's not revealed in the actual story. She goes to the Scientology hub to get a replacement God Alexa and is shipped an Alexa God 2.0. Aside from being already annoying, it now includes unwanted ads & commercials that you have to pay premium to turn off. This new upgrade is even worse and starts charging her with ridiculous sins fees. It refuses to turn itself off when commanded so she throws it out of the window. That's it; that's all that happens in that story.Story 4: Shadow Walker The Stalker
A guy is in love with his girlfriend and he uses a VR headset and program called Shadow Walker to electronically stalk her when she's with him or not with him. He is obsessed with recording their lives together and is constantly rewinding & replaying their past. His VR avatar appears as a shadow that's very pixelated and it follows his girlfriend who turns out to be his ex-girlfriend. She broke up with him because he was obsessed with recording everything about their lives and she gets a restraining order against him. He ignores the order and shows up at her door. They argue, she electrocutes him with a stun gun, he runs off. The story ends.Story 5: We Immortal, You Ain't
A handsome guy brings his girlfriend home to meet his parents and sister. He warns her that his mom can be overbearing and judgmental but she'll be fine. They're having dinner around the table and the mom starts telling him his girlfriend isn't worth his time and it's pointless to date her since they are inexplicably immortal (no, it's never explained why or how they are immortal) and the girlfriend is a mere mortal who will eventually get sick and die on him. The mom demands he breaks up with her and finds someone more like them. He refuses and informs them that he loves her, intends to marry her, and is planning on giving up his immortality to be with her (apparentlyit's something you can turn on and off). The mom gets angry and they all argue. The girlfriend goes outside to smoke and the house all of a sudden goes black from being hit by one of these space storms I assume (I'm just trying to tie these stories together). She goes back into the house and sees his family has him tied to a chair with wires pinned to his head. A few minutes later, she runs into him in the hall and calls out to him. He introduces himself to her as if it's his first time meeting her. His family has wiped his memory and reset him; he no longer knows her. The story ends.Story 6: Rent A Body

At the party, Judith suffers a stroke, and the doctor diagnoses her with Parkinson's disease. To not become a burden for her family, Judith decides to move into an old-age nursing home, Golden Sun Manor.A fellow nurse, Liesel, attends to Judith and helps her get settled in the new environment. Soon, Judith befriends a trio of old but lively people: Ruth, Trish, and Roland. The group invites Judith to play bridge with them, and they soon establish a sparkling bond.In her room, Judith's roommate, Annette, warns Judith that someone is watching over them. Initially, Judith fails to understand the warning, but later that night, she imagines a monster made up of tree bark lurking inside her room.Everyone at the facility convinces Judith that her visions are probably a sign of dementia. However, Judith refuses to believe that she is crazy and decides to unravel the mystery of the eerie bark monster.One night, Judith saw the bark monster attacking Annette, after which she suddenly died of a stroke. Before dying, Annette told Judith they had been marked and handed over a paper with names written on it.Annette speculated that after her death, the bark monster would kill another patient, Imogen, and then Judith. As soon as the revelations came out, Judith panicked and searched the room. She found a voodoo element hidden under the bed. After that, Judith didn't waste a moment and escaped the facility. On her way out, Judith saw some young teenagers who resembled Ruth, Trish, and Roland. However, at the moment, she failed to understand the uncanny resemblance.Judith contacted her daughter and Josh. However, instead of taking her home, Judith's daughter sent her back to the Manor. At the diner, Judith discovered a wall photograph in which she saw Ruth, Trish, and Roland in one frame. They all looked the same age 40 years ago. Judith tried to inform her daughter and Josh about the dangers, but she believed that Judith had lost touch with reality and was becoming paranoid.Back at the Manor, Judith sneaked inside the director's cabin and investigated further. She found that Roland Benson was a relative of Manor's director, Ms. Benson. Additionally, Ruth Price was related to a male nurse, Gary, and Ruth Cooper was a relative of a nurse named Elizabeth. Judith informed Josh about the link between the patients and the facility. Josh found a Celtic sigil representing an oak tree engraved on Trish's arm from a photograph in the diner. It was the root of all mysteries.Josh figured out that the Celtic sigil imprinted on Trish's arm was an Oak Tree symbol that represented a symbol of longevity and regeneration. Judith connected a few dots and investigated Roland's room, where she found her hairbrush with strands of her hair. Judith believed that Roland, Trish, and Ruth were practicing some kind of black voodoo magic. Thus, she replaced the strands of her hair with Roland's and followed Roland to the woods.Near the larger Oaktree, Judith and Josh witnessed the trio involved in a spiritual ceremony. Roland tried to sacrifice the strands of hair in a pouch to the fire. He demanded the Oak Tree Monster to prey upon the weak (Judith) and gave her energy to them. However, Josh, unaware of the fact that Judith replaced the hair, tried to stop Roland.Roland captured Josh and Judith and revealed that the trio and their relatives run the Manor. They brought old patients to the facility to sacrifice them like sheep. In return for their spiritual sacrifice, the Oak Tree gave them eternal life and youth. Ruth, Trish, and Roland avoided death, but they had to pay the price, and thus these innocent souls were a part of their bargain.Roland, believing he was sacrificing Judith's hair, finished the ceremony. The Oak Monster came out from the branches of the mythical Oaktree and took Roland's life.Judith grabbed a bottle of alcohol and threatened Trish and Ruth to burn the tree to ashes. But the treacherous evils lured Judith into becoming a part of their voodoo magic. Trish and Ruth promised Judith an eternal life and would never have to face the horrors of an old life. She could become young again in the Witcher hour, i.e., from midnight until dawn. Judith saw the trio at their young age when she escaped from the Manor.In the end, Judith was convinced of the Celtic Oak tree's magical power, and she was still confused. Trish and Ruth lured Josh and bought him in by revealing that if they became a part of their sect, Josh would never lose his grandmother, as he had lost his dad. Falling prey to emotions, Josh and Judith became a part of the sect. Soon, a Celtic sigil appeared on Judith and Josh's bodies, and Judith sparkled with youthful energy.The Manor ended as Judith celebrated her 70th birthday again, as she didn't age after becoming a part of Celtic magic. Josh joined the staff to stay close to his grandmother and make her young by sacrificing the innocent old souls who arrived at the Manor. The closing frame depicted a young Judith performing ballet under the magical Oak Tree with a young crowd cheering her graceful performance. Judith wanted to dance again and spend time with the younger generation, and in the end, she achieved it.

The actual climbing took 6 months and 6 days between April 2019 to October 2019. The first person to climb the 14 Eight-Thousanders was Italian climber Reinhold Messner who took 16 years between 1970 and 1986 and completed the feat without the use of supplementary oxygen. By 2013, the feat had been achieved in 7 years and 310 days by South Korean climber Kim Chang, who also did not use supplementary oxygen. Purja decided to use oxygen above 7,500m for Project Possible based on prior experiences when not using oxygen on past Eight-Thousander climbs would have stopped him from saving the lives of stricken climbers (something he ended up doing several times during the project). In 2021, when leading a larger all-Nepali team to complete the first winter ascent of K2, Purja did not use oxygen.Messner appears several times in the film talking about Eight-Thousanders and what Purja was trying to do; Purja met Messner after suffering a bad fall on Nanga Parbat but Messner gave him encouragement to keep going, with Purja recounting: ""He looked into my eyes and said, 'You can do it'. He told me to my face, and he hadn't even seen my climb. When he did the 8000-ers, the whole mountaineering community was against him, but he proved the concept. He did it when the world couldn't see his vision"".Nirmal was a Gurkha, who then served with the UK special forces. While in UK he got married to Suchi and then started training for the 14 peaks climb in 2008. In 2011 he was almost shot to death by a sniper, during a military mission. He never set foot on a mountain before 2012. But fell in love with the physical and mental intensity required. Nirmal quit the army even though his family was dependent on his income. He had 6 yrs to go, before he would secure his pension, but Nirmal was adamant about his passion. Nirmal needed to raise a huge amount to fund the expedition, but the money was forthcoming from donors. Nirmal re-mortgages his house to get the funds needed.The documentary begins in April 2019, with Purja (& his team Mingma David, Geljen, Lakpa Dendi, Gesman) attempting Annapurna I, statistically, the most dangerous Eight-Thousander. Purja joins with Canadian climber Don Bowie who has failed several times on the Annapurna. However, Purja encourages Bowie to come with his team and they are successful Summiting on 23 April, with Bowie saying, ""This guy believed they were going to do it, and they pushed thru"". The following day, Purja returns up the mountain to rescue a stricken climber (later identified as Malaysian climber Wui Kin Chin) which is successful (although Chin would die days later in Singapore). The rescue meant Purja lost his ""weather window"" for Dhaulagiri, which his team summits in bad weather on 12 May. Purja then summits Kanchenjunga on 15 May in a single 22-hour push passing all camps. While descending from the summit, at 8,450m and still in the death zone (above 8000 m), Purja and his team encounter two stricken Indian climbers (later identified as Kuntal Karar and Biplab Baidya); despite giving them all their oxygen and waiting for 12-hours for help which never arrives, one dies in Purja's arms, while the other succumbs at camp 4 - Purja suffers HACE (High Altitude Cerebral Edema, which makes one lose control of their motor functions) helping a third lost climber.Behind schedule and questioning himself after the deaths on Annapurna and Kanchenjunga, Purja summits the three neighboring Eight-Thousanders of Everest on 22 May, Lhotse on 22nd May, and Makalu on 24 May, in a record 48-hour push, taking a photograph of a large queue that had formed at the Hillary Step on Everest, which went viral and was re-printed on the front of the New York Times. The film breaks back to the period before the climbing started, with interviews from Purja's wife and brothers about his early life and career in the Gurkas and the Special Boat Squadron (SBS), and the sacrifices and financial risks that Purja took to create Project Possible. We also learn that his mother is unwell, and of a near-death experience from a sniper bullet to the face while on duty with the SBS.Purja then moves to the Karakoram Eight-Thousanders Summiting Nanga Parbat on 3 July but taking a 100m fall on while descending that was only arrested when he managed to grab hold of a random fixed rope that had been left behind. Purja tells the camera: ""I always say to myself, I'm not going to die today. Maybe tomorrow, but not today"". He then summits Gasherbrum I on 15 July and Gasherbrum II 18 July. When Purja arrives at K2 (also one of most dangerous Eight-Thousanders), spirits at Base Camp are very low, and high levels of avalanches meant that most teams are preparing to abandon their climbs. Purja's team breaks out some bottles and has a party to lift spirits. The next day, Purja and his team begin climbing K2 and lay down fixed ropes in the dangerous Bottleneck section of the climb at 1 am (when the snow is hardest and at its most stable). Purja summits K2 on 24 July, and over the next two days, 24 other climbers use the fixed ropes laid down by his team to summit the mountain. Two days later, Purja summits Broad Peak on 26 July, thus completing a 23-day push to climb the 5 Eight-Thousanders in the Karakoram.Purja rushes back to Kathmandu to be with his mother who has suffered a heart attack. He then returns to summit Cho Oyu on 23 September, and Manaslu on 27 September. He then spends a few weeks lobbying Nepali politicians to help him secure a permit from the Chinese to climb Shishapangma in Tibet, which he successfully summits on 29 October 2019. Purja calls his now dying mother from the summit ""we did it"". Later we seek Purja reunited with his mother and the world's media to celebrate the conclusion of his Project Possible.","Fearless Nepali mountaineer Nirmal Purja embarks on a seemingly impossible quest to summit all 14 of the world's 8,000-meter peaks in seven months."

Frank works hard to support his daughter, Crystal, while his demanding wife, Karen Delgado, stays away from the family. Due to a conflicted childhood, Frank has anger issues, like his late abusive father. He often ends up in correctional facilities for beating strangers with whom his toxic wife, Karen, mingles. The film begins as Frank comes out of the Hillsborough correctional facility and calls his high school pal, Terrance Swaino (Jon Bernthal), to meet him in his shop. In Frank's absence, Swaino and Packie Hanrahan (Shea Whigham) were looking after Crystal. As Frank arrives home, Swaino hands over Crystal to Frank, but she cries in his arms. The incident compels Frank to clean and straighten his life.A few years later, Crystal insists on going to UCLA for further studies. Frank is hesitant but agrees for her daughter's happiness. Later, Swaino and Packie pay them a visit on Christmas Eve, and Crystal cheerfully informs her beloved uncles about her college acceptance at UCLA. The friends go out to celebrate while Crystal's mother, Karen, arrives in town and takes her daughter shopping. In a night bar, Frank, Swaino, and Packie involve themselves in a bar fight, and in the heat of the moment, Frank loses his temper. Suddenly, Crystal arrives and loudly shouts to stop Frank from killing the person. Back to his senses, Frank blames his lousy buddies, Swaino and Packie, for always creating a mess. In anger, he cuts all ties with them and moves out with Crystal.3 months later, after Crystal moves to college, a lonely Frank invites Swaino and Packie to his shop to reconcile their friendship. While Swaino and Packie enjoy the party, Frank makes suspicious calls to a stranger.When Packie curiously inquired about Frank's suspicious calls, Frank finally told them that he had invited a drug dealer to supply them some substance to enlighten their reunion. However, their drug dealer wasn't a professional peddler but a rookie 19-year-old college student, Chad Walker, who sold drugs to earn an extra income. As Chad arrived at Frank's shop, Frank persuaded Chad to stay for a few drinks. While Chad quickly got accustomed to Swaino and Packie, Frank walked away for a while.Frank had been receiving constant messages and calls from Karen. She impatiently inquired about their daughter, Crystal, who hadn't been receiving Karen's call.In Frank's absence, Chad told Swaino and Packie a story about a girl he met on Instagram who sent him exposed pictures. For his amusement, Chad sent those pictures to his mates and showed them to Swaino and Packie. Later, he revealed that the girl tried to kill herself out of embarrassment, but Chad's father, who is the owner of the largest law firm in Boston, saved his life.When Frank arrived, he inexplicably asked Chad about the story he'd been telling his friends. In an argument, Chad discovered that Frank's daughter's name is Crystal, whose exposed pictures he sent to his buddies. Chad tried to run away, but Frank hit Chad with a wrench. Frank finally revealed that Chad Walker had ruined his daughter's life, who had been in a coma for two weeks. After the photos got viral, Crystal tried to swallow some pills that damaged her brain cells. Frank held himself equally responsible for the tragedy, but his toxic masculinity and temper revealed that he had planned to get rid of Chad Walker forever.Frank decided to shoot Chad and dispose of his body and thus needed his friends' help and support to commit the perfect crime. While Packie jumped on the ride without an argument, Swaino hesitated. Frank tried to shoot Chad when suddenly Swaino and Packie remembered the Instagram photo Chad had uploaded and tagged Frank's shop. They were in a fix.The three friends argued crazily when a fourth person arrived to amplify the drama. Karen visited Frank's shop, and inevitably they had to reveal the whole story. In anger, Karen punched Chad and later stopped Frank from turning himself in. The trio relied on the smartest guy in the lot, Packie, for some divine advice. Packie underlined, ""He ruined her life with a picture,"" while stoned. The fact gave an extremely well-knitted idea to Swaino. In the end, Swaino and the group clicked an embarrassing picture of Chad with Packie's private parts. They threatened Chad to viral the image on social platforms if he ever thought of revealing the night's events to the police or his rich and powerful dad.Chad got paranoid about his pretty-boy image and thus pledged to seal his mouth. After the necessary confirmation, Frank let the boy go. The following day, Frank, Swaino, Packie, and Karen attended Crystal at the hospital. Frank whispered in her ears that her family was there with her. Feeling the warmth of her extended family around her, Crystal moved her fingers and embraced Frank's hand. Probably, she came out of the coma, and the movie ended on a happy note.

He is a public defender and as he says in the narration of the first scene, there aren't enough people doing his job, and people who need help aren't getting enough of it.Twelve days before the collapse, Casi's first defendant in the movie is Ah-Chut, who does not speak English. There is no translator available. Getting him out of jail means appearing before the strict Judge Cymberline. He is not successful.Craig goes to the Tow Pound, telling Lea he is there to get a friend's car out. She can't help him. He offers her a lot of money and then flirts, but ultimately he is not successful. The car is a Lincoln Navigator which will be auctioned.The power goes out in much of the city. Casi needs a place to stay and visits Angus, who believes in conspiracy theories and has complicated equations on his blackboard. In a later visit, Angus explains the concept of a singularity in a black hole.Lea gets out of bed to find Craig using her computer. She throws him out.Ten days before the collapse, Casi hears two assistant DAs laughing about a Chinese prisoner. He demands to know more but they just laugh and get on the elevator. Casi meets with his friend Dane, another public defender who says Lea wants him to handle her case.Lea meets with Casi and explains what Craig wants and says she already has a record. In a flashback, she is shown at her job going to the car Craig wants and finding the drugs that are hidden there. Lea and Casi meet in a different location with Detectives Winston and Coburn who agree to let Lea help with the case.Casi has another defendant who has gotten clean. Normally, this would be good, but if he is clean, the defendant has a better chance of doing prison time. As a joke, Casi suggests the best thing for the man might be to go to Cuba. But when the man and Casi appear before Judge Cymberline, she is not pleased that she is seeing an outdated report on the man's medical status. The defendant ends up disappearing and Judge Cymberline finds out what Casi said. She tells him he could have ended his career by giving the man the advice he did.Casi and Dane have one scene where they are fighting martial arts style and also talking about Casi's situation.Lea has several meetings with Craig, who wants to pay her a lot of money because if he gets the drugs, he will able to get millions for them. At their second meeting, he brings a very large man and forces her into a 1970 LTD, driving her to a location where someone's body is in a freezer.Five days before the collapse, Lea has another meeting with Casi at a restaurant and explains her situation. She is tired of a job that she doesn't like but her past means that she can't do any better--legally. Casi feels pretty much the same way.Casi's boss tells him he will get six months' suspension if he is lucky and disbarred if he is not. The room appears to get smaller and Casi is floating. At night, Casi and Dane are dressed up in a bar and discussing how they can benefit from the car being auctioned.Four days before the collapse, Casi has the day off and is not dressed up. He gets a cell phone call from Winston saying Casi is now responsible for Lea and if she messes up, it is his fault. Winston says she is no longer working for the cops. Casi happens to run into Lea and they both end up on the subway when the power goes out. After dark, they go to her apartment and kiss, finally ending up in bed. While there, Casi tells Lea about his abusive mother who was deported to Colombia.Casi leaves and Craig literally bumps into him, taking his wallet. Then Craig, with his goon beside them, threatens Casi if he interferes with what they are trying to do.When the power comes back on, both of Casi's defendants from earlier are shown screaming in separate jail cells.On the day of the collapse, Casi and Dane have a plan. Lea will help them. Casi brings a sword that has been a decoration in this apartment, and Dane brings tear gas. Dane rents a car and gets Lea to retrieve it for him, but the process is more complicated than usual, giving Casi the opportunity to sneak in before the auction and switch tracking devices. At the auction, Craig bids on the Navigator but is outbid by a man with an accent who is actually involved with the drugs, and the process becomes more difficult.Nevertheless, Detectives Winston and Coburn are able to pull over and arrest the man who outbid Craig. Lea, Craig and the goon take a separate car, and Casi and Dane go to a building where numerous men who appear to be Hasidic Jews are doing something that appears illegal. Casi and Dane are also dressed as Hasidic Jews. The men with Jewish clothes and beards pay for the drugs and then Dane sets off the tear gas. He and Casi steal the money, while the cops end up getting the drugs.But Craig won't let Lea go, and as he is beating her up, Dane and Casi come in and save the day.The audience sees what is essentially a TV from the early days being turned off.Casi, Dane and Lea are standing next to the water. Each one has part of the money, and Dane and Lea leave in separate cars.

At home, Jay and Bobby are living with their mother Piya and their mother's new partner, Dylan. Piya has been feeling sick recently, and Dylan ominously tells them it is 'a bug'.One night, Malik appears at their house, wakes up his two sons, and urgently tells them that they are going on a road trip. While on the road with his boys, Malik passes a police car and tells his boys to get down. Hours later, Malik is pulled over by a different cop. Though Malik is polite, the cop is hostile and aggressive, and Malik sees something shifting behind his eyes. Malik determines the cop has been infected by a parasitic organism from another planet. Malik wrestles the gun away from the cop, knocks him out, and leaves him in the street.Back on the road, Malik confesses to his boys that this is not a road trip, but a rescue mission. He says that an alien parasite has taken over the planet and that their mother has been infected. As much as half the population may be infected by this alien parasite, which is using human bodies to reproduce. Malik needs to get his boys to safety and says they can protect themselves from the parasites with bug spray.In a grocery store, Jay starts to question Malik's story. Later, Malik learns his boys' mother is pregnant after his sons say Piya has been getting sick in the morning and having weird food cravings. When Malik calls his parole officer Hattie, it's revealed that he missed his psychiatric evaluation. Malik refuses to tell Hattie where he is but asks Hattie to check on his ex-wife. Piya and Dylan are found tied up in the garage, but alive.Hattie works with federal law enforcement in an attempt to retrieve Jay and Bobby. The feds believe Malik will kill his children and then himself. Hattie speaks to a former Marine friend of Malik's, who describes the assault incident that caused Malik to get dishonorably discharged from the Marine Corps. While describing how terrible the conditions were, he mentions that they were ""getting eaten alive by bugs"" and then found bodies of children in the wreckage. This incident caused Malik to snap. Hattie deduces that Malik is suffering from a mental disorder.Jay begins to suspect the aliens are not real when his father sees hundreds of meteors in the sky that Jay does not see. After they get a flat tire, Malik tries to steal a car but gets in an altercation with an old man who is the owner of the car. Malik gets away, gravely wounding the man, but is injured. Malik teaches Jay how to drive in order to get them to safety. While Malik sleeps off his injury in an abandoned house, Jay drives to get his father medicine and food. Jay overhears on the radio that his father is a wanted man for kidnapping his two children. Back at the abandoned house, Jay confronts his father. Malik admits that he lied, that he was in prison for two years, and that his brain has been playing tricks on him.The sons of the man Malik attacked track him down. The men kidnap Bobby and attempt to perform a citizen's arrest. Almost immediately, they open fire on Malik and Jay. Malik manages to apprehend both men without killing them and escapes with his boys.Malik calls his ex-wife and gives her an address of a diner where he will leave the boys, telling her he will not go back to prison. However, while the police and helicopters start chasing his car, Malik realizes Jay has hidden in the back seat. Jay refuses to leave his dad behind, even after an hours-long standoff with the police. Hattie insists to Malik that the authorities will take his mental health into consideration when deciding his fate, but Malik does not believe her.Not wanting to lose his father, Jay runs out of the car and points a gun at the police. Malik tries to distract the police to save his son, and then convinces him to put the gun down and run to him. They embrace, with the police lowering their weapons.

Strong-armed by the NSA to help them shut down Cicada, Connor takes part in the game alongside Gwen, a librarian seeking to be recruited, and his best friend Avi.

His starting point was the town of Ruth and his target was presumably a cabin he had approached on a previous expedition. When he was two days past his estimated return date and did not return home, his housemate Simon Rodgers alerted Gary's sister, Beverly Hinge, who in turn notified the police. More than a week had passed since Gary had last been seen.Initially, the police conducted a search based on the last GPS location of Gary's cell phone. Local and state police were involved, as well as park rangers and even volunteer groups. A few days later, it was reported that Gary's truck had been found, 55 miles from his departure in Ruth, Nevada, at the end of a dirt road at the bottom of a small hill. This finding prompted search parties, who covered large areas on foot, by helicopter and with the use of drones. None of the groups were able to find any trace or indication of Gary's location. When several more days passed without any news, the police terminated the search, as they considered that the chances of finding Gary alive were already practically nil, due to the fact that he used to travel with minimal supplies, water and equipment, which left him at the mercy of the weather (the hottest time of the year) and other dangers, such as the local fauna or the fact that there are multiple abandoned mining pits in the area. As time went by, the media stopped reporting on it. Subsequently, Beverly hired a private investigator, William 'Bill' Salerno, so that the case would not be abandoned. A reporter from a local media outlet, Gal Roberts, decided to convince her editor to keep on top of the story, lest it be forgotten as a ""cold case"".Thus, the investigation then focused on the clues that could be obtained from the truck, now considered a crime scene. Two aspects stood out; first, numerous fingerprints that did not match Gary Hinge's were found all over the truck, especially on the steering wheel. In addition, a trail of barefoot footprints, also not matching Gary's, was found. Since the John Doe's fingerprints did not match any database, the police found themselves at a dead end. In parallel, Bill Salerno started digging into Gary's social networks and Gal Roberts finds a promising clue in the video blog where Gary used to post his hiking and survival adventures, under the alias ""Scorpion Sam"". The hiker had some 50,000 followers, a fact unknown to his family and people close to him. Several of his readers believe they have some idea about Gary's final whereabouts, and that the question about his final destination could be related to some of his publications.In the next to last of the published videos, Gary appears in frame from his home, narrating a very unusual experience, which had left him very disturbed: In his last excursion, he had been walking for three days in an unknown area, when he noticed the smell of smoke. Following that trail, he found a dilapidated-looking cabin, as if abandoned, but with smoke coming out of an old chimney. However, a sense of ""imminent danger"" caused him to move away from the site and make camp away from the area. The next morning, Gary reported that he found a trail of barefoot footprints, and on the way back to his truck, he felt he was being watched, and even felt he was being followed. This publication had a lot of comments, most of them negative, where followers expressed serious doubts about Gary's account, questioning why he had not recorded anything and did not present any evidence; another large number of comments were from users demanding him to give the coordinates of the place and another part of the visitors of his blog challenged him to come back. Feeling the victim of cyber-bullying and visibly affected, Gary recorded and uploaded one last video, explaining that he would not give the exact location of the mystery cabin, since he did not want to encourage inexperienced people to venture into those desert regions, and informed that he would return to the site, accompanied by his video camera and a gun for protection.
White Pine County landscape.
Several weeks after the truck was found and search and rescue efforts were completed, a group of hikers in White Pine County reported that a backpack, which turned out to be the property of Gary Hinge, had been left at their campsite. Upon checking the contents of the backpack, aside from Gary's belongings and identification, his severed hand was found, still holding his video camera. Forensic analysis revealed that the hand had been severed from the victim while he was still alive, within a period of no more than five weeks. When authorities examined the memory card inserted into the camera, they discovered what happened to Gary on one fateful night.The footage found reveals that Gary was indeed able to find his way back to the mystery cabin; his first video entry was recorded at dusk, mentioning that he had been on the road for a day and a half and was sure of the route. Subsequently, he finds various markers he had left from his previous visit. Next, the following recordings consist of video fragments all recorded under infrared light, starting with Gary talking very frightened; he comments that he is already very close to the cabin and that he can smell smoke, as in the previous time. Suddenly, he hears chanting that seems to be a human voice, although it seems distorted. Once he finds the cabin, Gary confirms that it is the same one he saw earlier. While filming the outside of the cabin, Gary detects a human silhouette moving towards him. Being very careful not to make noise on the rocky ground, Gary tries to move away from the site, but is eventually spotted by a human-like being, but with severe physical deformities, who attacks him and the camera stops recording.Both the reporter and the private investigator speculate what or who might have attacked and killed Gary; it is mentioned that the police have made this footage public in the hope that someone in the audience might offer some additional clue, which has sparked a series of conspiracy theories linking Gary's disappearance to real or supernatural issues as diverse as Area 51, atomic testing, local Indigenous rituals, satanic groups or extraterrestrials. However, Gal Roberts expresses serious concerns about the fact that at least 17 social media accounts have taken it upon themselves to make expeditions to the area. Additionally, one of these groups is said to have posted that they have managed to find the trail of the cabin and its mysterious occupant, and that they will reveal the results of their expedition in 2022.

Catwoman rescues Bruce (and Alfred) from Poison Ivy. In the meantime, the Holiday killings have continued through Valentine's Day, Saint Patrick's Day, and April Fools' Day.On Mother's Day, Holiday kills the gunmaker that had been supplying his weapons. That night, Scarecrow escapes from Arkham Asylum and ends up in a fight with Batman, and escapes by injecting fear toxin into Batman's abdomen. In a fear-induced hallucination, Batman staggers around Gotham, ending up in Crime Alley, where Catwoman finds him and takes him home. Carmine's daughter, Sofia Falcone, meets with her father after arranging Scarecrow's escape and asks for a seat at his table, which he declines. Dent and Gordon visit Bruce Wayne to get his testimony regarding the night Alberto was killed, with Dent insinuating that there might be a connection between him and the murders, due to the Waynes funding the Falcone Crime Family in the past. Bruce recalls an incident from his childhood where he met Carmine after his father saved his life following a shooting from the Maronis, and claims that this incident might've lead to the death of his parents a year later, insisting that any loyalty between the Waynes died with them.On Father's Day, Maroni meets with his father, Luigi, who is then murdered by Holiday. Following his last advice of making peace with his enemies, Maroni approaches Dent, agreeing to testify against Falcone in exchange for prosecutorial immunity. On the Fourth of July, Harvey and Gilda watch the evening fireworks display on a boardwalk alongside Gordon's family. At the same time, Batman is captured while trying to stop Scarecrow and the Mad Hatter from robbing a bank for the Falcones, but easily escapes his restraints and defeats the two villains. At Carmine's signal, a mob hitman attacks the Dents. Catwoman intervenes but is in turn knocked unconscious by the hitman, who also knocks out Harvey when he gives chase under the boardwalk. When Harvey awakens, he finds the hitman dead, shot by one of holiday's guns, and hears a voice telling him to run before the police arrive.Before Maroni's trial, Batman sneaks into Dent's house, finding paraphernalia associated with the Holiday killer in the basement, along with an Oxford pennant, presenting this evidence to Gordon privately on the courthouse roof. During the trial, Dent is tormented by more messages from the voice, and Maroni, going back on his deal, claims that Carmine is an upstanding citizen. Convinced by the Falcones that Dent is Holiday, Maroni throws a vial of acid in Dent's face to get revenge for his father's death, although he survives with horrible scarring. Waking up bandaged in the hospital, the voice confronts Dent again, and then takes over his body, escaping from the hospital after getting a phone call from Carmine. The call turns out to be a trap to lure Dent out to be assassinated for the Holiday killings, but Dent manages to kill the hitmen before being dragged underwater.At Carmine's birthday party, he celebrates the supposed death of Holiday, only for Holiday to kill his sister, Carla Viti. Batman interrogates Gilda in order to learn more about Dent, still wanting to help him because of their friendship. Dent meets Solomon Grundy in the sewers and enlists the latter's help to attack the people who've wronged him, attacking the police convoy escorting Sal Maroni to prison. Batman, disguised as an officer, defeats Grundy and confronts Dent with Gordon, who has removed his bandages to reveal his scarred face and his new personality. Gordon accuses Dent of being Holiday, revealing the guns found in his basement, shortly before Maroni is shot by Holiday. Dent, seemingly having deduced who Holiday is, attacks both Batman and Gordon to keep them from giving chase to the killer, and then escapes with Grundy. Batman returns to Wayne Manor, which Alfred prepares for another Halloween, and begins to wonder what the point of his mission is if his parents helped create the criminals he fights; however, Alfred assures him that they would be proud. Dent and Grundy then attack Arkham Asylum, freeing numerous inmates, with the exception of Calendar Man. Batman begins to doubt that Dent was connected to the killings, citing the fact that he supposedly went to Oxford and never told anyone, and later asks Catwoman about her obsession with the Falcone family when she saves him from being shot by Carmine. She reveals that Carmine is her father, and she wants to find out her mother's name.Dent and his associates begin to make their move, with Poison Ivy, Scarecrow and Mad Hatter attacking the streets, distracting the police to allow Dent, Joker, Grundy and Penguin to attack Carmine's building. Batman and Catwoman arrive, subduing most of the rogues. However, Harvey manages to shoot Falcone. Falcone's daughter Sofia runs into the room, picks up the pistol, and tries to shoot Harvey, but his gun had only two bullets. She falls out of a window. Catwoman catches Sofia, but Sofia lets go (probably due to the grief of losing so many family members) and falls to her death. When Catwoman unmasks herself, Falcone says the name, ""Louisa."", which is probably Selina's birthmother's name. Later, Batman, Gordon, and Dent meet on the rooftop with the Batsignal. Dent confesses to all of the Holiday murders and surrenders to Gordon.After Harvey is placed in Arkham Asylum, Batman visits Gilda. She tells him that she was the Holiday Killer. She was in a relationship with Alberto Falcone when they were students at Oxford. The Falcone family forced the two to get an annulment and forced Gilda to have an abortion, so she wanted revenge on the Falcone family. Gilda wonders if Batman will arrest her or tell Captain Gordon that she is the Holiday Killer. Batman only wants to know if she's done killing people and leaves without telling her his plans.The movie ends with a scene at Wayne Manor. Bruce wonders why Alfred still bothers to leave candy for trick-or-treaters. Selina walks downstairs and teases Bruce. The doorbell rings. A family of three--two parents and a boy dressed as Batman--have come to partake in the holiday tradition.In the post credits scene, the doorbell rings again. Alfred opens the door and sees The Flash and Green Arrow.",The killer known as Holiday continues to stalk the Falcone crime family while a new class of costumed criminal rises in Gotham City.

Upset, Kerrie goes back to her dorm room where she glimpses a figure watching her. When the girls hear her screams and rush into her room, they discover Kerrie dead, having fallen out of her dorm room window.
New student Camille Meadows takes Kerrie's place at the academy. She meets headmistress Mrs. Landry and her son Trevor who works as a handyman. Student Helina shows Camille to her room which happens to be Kerrie's old room. Camille notices strange supernatural occurrences in the dorm room. Camille encounters Alice and the members of her clique; Bethany, Yvonne, Rosalind, and Lenora. The group harasses Camille and Helina until a fight breaks out. Mrs. Landry sentences the girls to spend detention in the library. Alice convinces Camille and Helina to join her and the others in a seance to contact Kerrie. Although Camille and Helina expect another prank, the group is stunned when they actually make contact with a spirit that warns them that they will be murdered. The group wonder if they communicated with Kerrie or the Edelvine Ghost. Later that night, Lenora is attacked and killed by an unseen assailant.
The next day, Mrs. Landry questions the girls on Lenora's unusual disappearance and informs them her personal items are missing, suspecting she has run away. The group investigates her room with Trevor's help and discovers a strange cross drawn in blood on Lenora's bed. Camille later identifies the cross as a symbol on a pendant worn by Alicia Kane, the deceased student who supposedly became the Edelvine Ghost. Later that night, Rosalind is killed in the shower, her body being discovered by Camille. The death is presumed an accident. Unsettled, Camille visits Helina and they discuss the possibility of ghosts. Bethany spots a masked figure in her room which disappears when she screams for help. Bethany claims it is the Edelvine Ghost but Mrs. Landry dismisses it as a bad dream while Camille is also unconvinced it was a ghost as Bethany was able to scare it away.
Camille, Helina, Alice, Bethany, and Yvonne meet for another seance to contact Rosalind and ask her what happened. Rosalind's spirit states she was murdered and identifies Camille as the killer. Alice attacks Camille while the others grow suspicious of Camille. While practicing for her dance recital, Yvonne is murdered by the masked figure Bethany saw. After another haunting from Kerrie, Camille moves in with Helina, and the two comfort each other over recent events. Alice receives a text from Yvonne asking her to go outside, where she discovers Lenora's corpse before being knocked out by the masked assailant. Camille tries to follow Alice but is knocked unconscious by another masked assailant.
Camille awakens restrained in the library next to an unconscious Alice. Bethany and Trevor reveal themselves as the killers and secret lovers, having murdered Kerrie and Alice's clique in an attempt to hide the fact that Bethany stole an essay from Kerrie which Bethany ended up winning a $250,000 scholarship from. Bethany also reveals she faked the communication with the spirits at the seances and that Trevor murdered Alicia Kane who was his babysitter and faked her suicide. Bethany states her plan to murder Alice, frame Camille for the murders, and then tie up any loose ends by killing Helina in a faked suicide. Camille reveals that she isn't really Camille, having assumed Camille Meadows's identity in order to avenge her friend Kerrie. The power goes out, causing Bethany to leave and fix it. As Trevor threatens Camille, Helina knocks him unconscious and frees Camille and Alice, having been lead to the library by Kerrie's ghost.
The trio attempts to escape but the power comes back on and Bethany ambushes them. Camille fends Bethany off and stabs her in the neck with a light bulb, killing her. Alice and Helina escape the library as Trevor reawakens. Camille manages to decapitate him with a bookshelf. Camille retrieves some photos of her and Kerrie from her dorm room and goes to leave only to be confronted by Helina. Camille tells Helina about her faked identity while Helina asks how she will find Camille in the future.

LeMay used to clear Cheyenne for the army and committed unspeakable crimes against the tribes. A Cheyenne chief, White Thunder, cursed LeMay for his sins, saying that his own seed would kill him. Haunted by the prophecy, LeMay hunted down his children and killed them one by one before they killed him.As The Last Son begins, LeMay arrives at a saloon called Two-One to kill his son, Lionel, whom he bore with a whore, Anna (Heather Graham), who worked there. LeMay stabs the 20-year old Lionel in the woods and then visits Anna, inquiring about Lionel's twin brother. Anna tells the devil that there is no twin and that he may be misinformed. In his rage, LeMay cuts off Anna's fingers and leaves.Later, he visits another woman, Claire, who used to work as a whore but now lives a peaceful life in the woods. Claire lives with her husband and daughter, Megan (Emily Marie Palmer). LeMay finds Megan harmless and thus leaves her alone. However, LeMay kills Anna's husband before leaving.Soon, the story brings in LeMay and Anna's son, Cal Talisker (Machine Gun Kelly), who was born along with his twin brother Lionel in 1858. But Anna didn't want to raise Cal in a brothel, so she left him at the Virginia City home for boys. When Cal grew up, he joined the army and trained as a Gatling gun loader. However, he was soon discharged. Haunted by his past and neglected by his parents, Cal became an outlaw and started robbing banks and killing law enforcers.When LeMay killed Lionel, Anna begged Cal to leave for Brooks, Canada, and save his life. But Cal was as stubborn as his father, and instead of going north, he killed more army men to arrange ammunition to kill LeMay.A tracker named Solomon arrives in town and tells Sheriff that someone killed some army men and asks Sheriff whether there's any trouble in the town. Sheriff said there was a stabbing in one of the bars and Solomon goes to investigate. LeMay's daughter, Megan, too prepares to take revenge on LeMay for killing her adoptive father. Meanwhile Cal and his two friends kills more army men and loots ammunition. Some law enforcing officers arrive in the town and tells Solomon that LeMay has already killed six young men last year and seeks Solomon's help in capturing LeMay.Finally, Solomon captures LeMay and tries to convince him that the Cheyenne Curse was a myth and that he was on a futile hunt, killing his own blood. But LeMay was a man in ruins. He was doomed yet arrogant.Solomon brings LeMay to the sheriff's office in Virginia City. At the exact moment, Cal arrives in the city with a small army he had raised to secure an escape for himself and Anna. But before they could leave, Solomon points a gun at Cal inside the brothel. Cal tricks Solomon and kills him. In between their gunfights, LeMay tricks the police officers and escapes.Cal's men informs him about the devil's presence in the vicinity, and in the final showdown, they finally face each other. Though Cal takes a shot at his father, it is LeMay who kills his last son, Cal. In the end, Megan catches wounded LeMay off guard and shoots him.Hence, Cheyenne's prophecy did come true, but it wasn't LeMay's son who killed him. It was his daughter Megan, whom he perceived to be harmless. The closing voice establish that as soon as Megan shot her father, she left the city. She didn't wait to verify that he was dead or not. He could be alive. But if he survived Megan's shot, then the whole prophecy was a myth, to begin with.Megan moved on and eventually settled into a peaceful life in Carson City, Nevada. She married and bore three children, two older daughters and a son, who came last. As a result, even though LeMay attempted to end his bloodline, the last son survived.

When the genius inventor who created the robots and whose corporation runs Zone 414 realizes that his adult daughter Melissa has gone missing inside Zone 414, he hires private investigator David Carmichael to bring her home. David is a former police detective who was forced to retire after he shot his partner and a criminal during a hostage taking. He is still troubled by the death of his wife by suicide and his refusal of several offers of alcoholic drinks suggests he may be trying to stop drinking.The Veidt Corporation tests David by asking him to shoot a woman who pleads for her life; David deduces that she must be a lifelike android and shoots her, passing the test. Next, psychologist Joseph Veidt interviews David to see if he is suitable for job, which requires discretion and willingness to work outside of the law. When he passes both tests, he meets Veidt's brother Marlon, the inventor and executive. Marlon tells David that Melissa, his adult daughter, has gone missing inside Zone 414. He wants David to find her without involving the police, fearing that news of a missing person in Zone 414 might lead to a crackdown on the zone's regulatory exemptions.David pairs up with Jane, a highly advanced and self-aware robot with artificial intelligence, to track down the missing daughter. Jane has developed human-like emotions that transcend the surface depiction of emotions required in her work as a prostitute. She tells David that a man is leaving threatening messages and she has become afraid for her safety.David meets Royale, the pimp who helps wealthy clients select a robot to cater to their sexual needs. He asks her if some wealthy clients are paying to be able to threaten robots like Jane, but Royale denies that she would comply with this request. He asks Royale about Melissa and she tells him that the daughter was pretending to be a robot and was hanging out at a gritty part of the city.As Jane continues to face threats from her stalker, the pair discover Melissa hanging by a noose in an empty warehouse in a boatyard. David returns Melissa's body to Marlon and suggests that the authorities be alerted to Zone 414's dangers. When David meets Joseph Veidt to receive his payment, David goads the psychologist into admitting that he was stalking Jane. He tells David that when Melissa caught him torturing and killing androids, he killed her. Soon after, Joseph arrives at Jane's apartment, and attempts to immobilize her with a hand-held device. Jane is momentarily frozen, but regains mobility and overpowers Joseph. When David returns to see Jane, he offers his gun to Jane and she shoots Joseph dead.Marlon Veidt is seen making adjustments to an android that looks exactly like Melissa (so she may have been a lifelike android all along or Veidt may be replacing the dead human daughter with an android). In the final scene, the Veidt Corporation gets David to record a statement claiming that Zone 414 is safe and they threaten David with legal action if he criticizes the android city.

He does, however, keep up with a small circle of his best friends from high school (hat tip to Facebook). As Bryce prepares to return home for his 15 year high school reunion and realizes his high school classmates are judging him poorly because he isn't married with children, he stretches the truth and tells them that Madison is his girlfriend.Willow Valley, Alabama is soon abuzz with news of the impending arrival of Bryce and his mystery starlet. Bryce tries to convince Madison to accompany him to his high school reunion in Alabama and pretend to be his girlfriend. Madison reluctantly accepts - if only to get out of LA for the weekend so she can avoid her ex-boyfriend, rock star Zane Thomas.Bryce and Madison (who is not quite the fish-out-of-water one might expect) get to know each other better over the course of many pre-reunion events, often with Bryce's small circle of high school friends (David, Rick, Rachel, and Mark) and former classmates (Winton the Mayor, Charlotte the former head cheerleader, Kevin the high school bully, and others) in tow.During the reunion weekend, Zane shows up in Alabama to win Madison back, Madison gets the news that she has landed the role of a lifetime with Bryce's help, and Bryce comes to the realization that he loves Madison, just as Zane takes a knee to propose to her. Bryce's lie about being Madison's boyfriend is revealed to everyone, and his apology leads to a final dance under the stars at the reunion.While Stars Fell on Alabama is lighthearted and fun, the movie explores a number of topics, including the definition of success, the role of friends and family, and following one's heart. The movie features the South but doesn't make fun of it. And ultimately, of course, Stars Fell on Alabama is a love story, named after - and featuring a performance of - the timeless jazz standard Stars Fell on Alabama.","A Hollywood agent returns to his Alabama hometown for 15 year high school reunion.

Patrick used to run a lighthouse. He told Keegan that the Lighthouse kept the huntsman away from the river. If the lighthouse ever failed, the huntsman would enter the river and hunt down the deer with the magical antlers. The deer gave life to the river and the land around it.
The deer, the living creatures and the town celebrates the river with a dance in its honor: Riverdance.Patrick used to operate the lighthouse by hand every night. Keegan had suggested to automate it, but Patrick was against it. On the night of Patrick's death, Keegan fails to ignite the light of the lighthouse and the huntsman (Brendan Gleeson) materializes and enters the river.His Spanish friend Moya (Hannah Herman Cortes) invites him to meet her by the waterfall at high noon. Moya takes Keegan over the waterfall to a secluded place and teaches him Riverdance. She shows how she can even dance on water with her skills and balance. Moya tells Keegan that this is a magical place, and she came here when her own grandmother died and ended up seeing her. She introduces Keegan to 2 speaking deer named Penny (Lilly Singh) and Benny (Jermaine Fowler).
Penny and Benny are part of a herd of giant deer, who perform flawless river dance. The leader of the herd is a deer also named Patrick. Patrick re-iterates that it's the Riverdance of the deer that keeps the rivers flowing, and that in turn sustains life.Meanwhile the huntsman is in the river and has set up a trap near the largest watering hole.
Keegan plays hurling with the deer and helps his team win by scoring a goal. Keegan wanders off into a cave and finds the huntsman there. Huntsman reveals that Keegan let him in by not turning the lighthouse on. He offers Keegan to come to his world, where Keegan can reunite with his grandfather. But Keegan refuses him as his grandfather never trusted the huntsman. He vanishes. The deer Patrick later reveals that the cave is an ancient lighthouse, and if one faces their fears inside it, they can overcome it.Patrick the deer and Moya take Keegan through a mountain valley to a point where the valley meets the sea and is where all the spirits depart the living world. Moya introduces Keegan to the gatekeeper (John Kavanagh), who says that Keegan's grandfather also danced through the gates.At that moment, the huntsman attacks and manages to capture Benny, who is the slowest of the deer. Patrick the deer turns back to save Benny. The huntsman takes Keegan hostage and demands that Patrick surrenders his antlers in exchange for Keegan. In the ensuing struggle, The Huntsman shoots Patrick the deer down.
The river stops flowing. The huntsman takes Patrick's antlers and prepares to leave. The gatekeeper warns Keegan to stop the huntsman and to return the antlers to the river. Keegan uses his hurling skills to stop the huntsman and drops the antlers in the water. Patrick the deer's spirit arises from the water and glows like a lighthouse, banishing the huntsman from the living world.Benny's antlers grow suddenly to King size, and he is crowned the new king of the deer. The river starts flowing again. Keegan and Mayo return to the town.
Keegan leads the town's celebrations for St Patrick's day. Keegan lights the lighthouse and promises to uphold his grandfather's tradition.
As the new king, Benny bans hurling and early morning dancing as he is lazy and fat. He also decrees that he can eat all the raspberries he wants. He is abandoned by the entire herd.",An Irish boy named Keegan and a Spanish girl named Moya journey into the mythical world of the Megaloceros Giganteus who teach them to appreciate Riverdance as a celebration of life.

Her neighbor Susan helps them out by keeping David with her while Laura is attending to other matters. But all that changes one night when Laura hears noises coming from David's room and sees a bunch of people standing around his bed. She runs outside screaming for help and bangs on the door of Susan's and ask her to call the police. When she returns home, all the people have vanished from David's room, but David is left in the bed sideways with his shirt off his body.By the time the local cops show up, Detectives Paul (Emile Hirsch) and Steve (Cranston Johnson) cannot find any signs of a break-in.

Paul's more sympathetic and says they'll look into it. After they leave, she checks David for marks and bruises. She can't find anything and when he wakes up, David says he doesn't remember what happened, except that he was dreaming of drowning in a river of blood.One night, Laura calls Paul to her house when she hears noises outside, but again Paul finds nothing. David gets suddenly, unexplainably sick, puking blood and admitted to hospital. The doctors run every possible test, but can't find anything. They only know he's getting worse by the minute and probably won't make it through the night. Laura suggests that the people she saw in David's room poisoned him, but the doctors say they have tested for poison too and results were negative. Laura keeps the vigil with David and says her heartbreaking goodbyes - but by the next morning, he's made a mysteriously complete recovery.It's not long before David's sickness returns, though. Laura brings him back to the hospital. While there, she reveals to Paul that she was raised in a cult but she escaped 8 years ago and probably it's them who had visited David that day. Later that night, near David's hospital bed, Laura overhears voices outside the room and sees the doctors saying things like, ""The boy is the priority,"" and ""Wait until she's asleep."" Laura looks out the window and sees some shady-looking men getting out of a car, and that's all the motivation she needs to take David and leave. She takes him to the neighbor's while she runs across the street to pack their stuff.Paul calls Laura while she's packing her bags and she asks him to meet her outside the school where she teaches and says not to trust anybody hinting everyone is in on the conspiracy to kidnap David. But when she goes back across the street, she finds her neighbor Susan (Erin Bradley Dangar) dead on the floor - and David making a meal of her major organs, saying he feels better. In a panic, Laura paints ""He Is Coming"" on the wall in Susan's blood - a mantra used by the cult - and leaves town with David, chucking her phone out the window when Paul calls again.She drives to a motel and sleeps while David watches cartoons, giggling like the kid he is. But in the morning, Laura wakes to see she and David are on the news. She switches cars and takes off again, telling David she needs to find an old friend who can help her remember what she's forgotten. Meanwhile, Paul and Steve are at the morgue with the dead neighbor. Steve shows Paul a bunch of old newspaper articles about Laura - whose name used to be Anna - and the pedophile ring she was a victim of. Steve believes Laura killed the neighbor and the whole cult idea is a fantasy used to cover up the severe trauma she suffered.While Laura seeks out a drug addict named Jimmy (Blaine Maye), who grew up in the cult with her, Paul does some investigating on his own and finds the shrink who treated Laura/Anna. She'd been institutionalized after her father was arrested for running the pedophile ring. He says Anna's father used to pimp her out along with Jimmy and confirms that the whole cult idea was a story she constructed in her head.But Jimmy tells a different story. He tells Laura/Anna that the cult used to have ceremonies where they killed animals. Then her father would have her recite this special chant that only she could do - a chant that would summon a demon who would then rape her. Laura doesn't want to believe that, saying it was her father who raped her - but Jimmy insists it was a demon. Then David gets sick again, and Laura takes him to another motel. But things are even worse this time as David becomes increasingly hostile toward her, screaming and ranting in dirty language asking for ""food"".Unable to handle it, Laura runs out to her car and screams her frustration, not knowing what to do. Then she sees the pimp rooming next door beating one of her girls and invites him to her room, and David takes it from there - making a vicious, bloody meal out of the guy. Laura cleans up the mess afterward as David watches cartoons, all better now and happy.Then, they drive to a church where Laura dumps what's left of the pimp and paints another ""He Is Coming"" message. Meanwhile, Paul and Steve show up at Jimmy's house only to find him dead, too, with a bunch of crosses sticking out of his mouth and ""He Is Coming"" cut into his chest.At another motel, David and Laura have this wonderful bonding moment. David says he was dreaming that he was flying and could see her. Then he says the world was in his hands and it cracked in half - there was fire, and everyone was screaming but that he was okay like he was a superhero. ""Nothing could touch me,"" he says. Laura says his sickness is getting worse and more frequent. She says she'll stay with him, but she won't let him kill anyone else.At the pimp crime scene, Steve says it's time to drop the net on Laura, but Paul says they need to go easy on her. David soon gets sick again and when a bunch of guys bust into their darkened room, Laura uses the gun she stole from the pimp and unloads.But when she turns the lights on, it's Steve and two other local cops that she's killed. Later, after she's put some distance between them, Laura calls Paul, who's at the morgue with Steve's body. She says she didn't mean to kill him, and he begs her to turn herself in. But she tells him she's going back where it all started - meaning the house where she lived with her father.When they get to the abandoned house, the banner (from her memory) still flaps in the wind - but instead of ""He Is Coming,"" it says ""Happy Birthday,"" leading us to think Laura might be delusional after all. And when she goes up to the bedroom, it looks the same from her memories - except that there are no cult sigils. Then she goes back out to the car and brings sickly David in, saying that no matter what happens, she loves him and will always take care of him.Laura carries him up to the bedroom and then recites the chant, which she remembers perfectly. She demands that the demon cure David - who she now believes is their son. Laura says she'll kill David if it doesn't. She repeats the chant several more times and an ugly, horned figure rises up behind them, moving slowly toward them.Then, the room shakes and dark smoke billows out of the doorway - but just as the demon touches her, Paul busts in with a bunch of cops. Laura tells him she conjured the demon but that they scared him off. She says the cult fed David flesh to awaken the monster in him, but Paul says she imagined the whole thing. He says he can help her, but she says she can't let David live like this. She loves him too much. And Paul shoots her before she can bring the knife down.Later, in the hospital, Paul sits with David and tells him he'll protect him and make him better. He waits for the nurse to get called away and then cuts off a slice of his arm to feed David. So apparently, Laura was right all along - the cult is very real, and Paul is a part of it. Paul says that no one can know who David really is - and it turns out that Paul killed Jimmy to silence him. Paul tells David he'll never be alone again and that his father's there for him now. And then David rises out of bed and hugs the horned beast, calling it ""Daddy"" and resting his head on its shoulder.

The autoimmunity epidemic affects 24 million people in the USA. What is going on? The interconnected epidemics of anxiety, chronic illness and substance abuse are, according to Dr Gabor Maté, normal.

This is a journey with a man who has dedicated his life to understanding the connection between illness, addiction, trauma and society. Trauma is the invisible force that shapes our lives. It shapes the way we live, the way we love and the way we make sense of the world. It is the root of our deepest wounds. Dr. Maté gives us a new vision: a trauma-informed society in which parents, teachers, physicians, policy-makers and legal personnel are not concerned with fixing behaviors, making diagnoses, suppressing symptoms and judging, but seek instead to understand the sources from which troubling behaviors and diseases spring in the wounded human soul. He points us to the path of individual and collective healing.""Trauma is not what happens to you.
Trauma is what happens inside you,
as a result of what happens to you.""

Abused by his father and bullied at school, his only friend is his cousin Teddo. Makwa develops a crush on a girl and is envious of James, who draws the girl's attentions.Makwa's teacher - a priest - gives a sermon saying a tortured spirit is an unworthy sacrifice before God, and that unwillingness to accept responsibility will bring suffering that will spread like a plague.Teddo teaches Makwa how to shoot a rifle. Makwa holds a kitchen knife over his sleeping father's head. In the woods he chances to see James walking and calmly takes aim and shoots him. He picks up the spent shell casing. Makwa asks Teddo for help and they bury James together. At home when his father makes to strike him, he bites his father's hand. He runs to the woods and urinates where James's body is buried.In 2019, Makwa is a businessman in California calling himself Michael Peterson. He has an infant son with his white wife Greta. He asks a co-worker his opinion on his braid, saying ""It's sort of my brand around here."" The co-worker agrees that it ticks all the right boxes. After an initially impassive response to Greta's news that she is pregnant, he assures her he is pleased. He then goes to a club and pays to choke a stripper, continuing to choke her long after she begins to panic. He recites Hail Marys.Teddo is released from his latest prison term, a ten-year sentence for drug dealing. He moves in with his sister Cammy and her young son Daniel. She apologizes for not visiting him. He gets a job and bonds with Daniel. Cammy tells him Makwa has moved away and never returned, even for family funerals. He retrieves stashed money and a pistol and visits James' mother, Lisa. He breaks down sobbing, saying he has to tell her about her son.Makwa finds Teddo waiting outside his apartment building and hustles him in before people can see him. Teddo draws his pistol. Makwa asks if he wants money, a car, a job. Teddo says he confessed and shoots Makwa in the arm. He aims but is unable to shoot again, and lays the gun down. Taking the gun, Makwa asks if he told them about him. Teddo says he did and Makwa immediately fires several times, killing Teddo.Makwa's attorney assures him that it is clearly self defense, but that a Wisconsin investigator wants to speak to him about a boy's disappearance 35 years ago. Remains have been found and Makwa has been implicated. In Wisconsin an attorney tells Makwa he could be charged with James' murder, based on the remains and Teddo's confession to Lisa. Makwa takes flowers to the bedridden Lisa in hospital to assure her of his innocence, calling Teddo mentally ill, drunk, and criminal. Lisa believes Teddo. Makwa claims all the worthwhile Native Americans died fighting, and his generation is descended from cowards. He puts his hand over her mouth, threatening what will happen if she doesn't keep her mouth shut. Lisa says she won't say anything.The prosecutor asks Makwa perfunctory questions about the day of James' murder. Makwa says he doesn't recall. The prosecutor says Teddo's claims aren't credible based on his criminality and mental state, and Lisa is in a state herself. He regards James' death as just another missing Native American and ends the interview. Before getting into his car, Makwa takes the spent shell casing from his pocket and drops it on the ground.In California, Makwa receives his promotion but declines to celebrate. Saying he doesn't know if he will be okay, he leaves for home where he shows Greta his bullet wound. He goes to the beach and gazes out to sea. The film cuts to the Native American man with smallpox lying next to his dead wife. Makwa collapses into a sitting position on the beach.

His parents decide to take him to nearby town Amreli one day to watch a movie. They generally don't like movies, but this is a religious film called ""Jai MahaKaali"". The movie has actors like Amrita Singh and Shatrughan Sinha.
Samay is mesmerized and notices that the light on the canvas comes from the projection room.Samay has friends Manu (Rahul Koli) and ST (Kishan Parmar). Bapuji is against films as they are a Brahmin cast and movies are against their culture and values. Samay aims for something bigger as his father is only a tea vendor. Samay helps his father sell tea at the village railway station.
Samay plays with colored glasses and sees how different colors of glasses can give a completely different hue to the world.Samay collects empty matchboxes from the tracks and spins his own stories by taking cues from the pictures on top of the matchboxes. Samay has to travel to a nearby town Amreli by train to attend school with his friends. Samay starts bunking class to watch movies at the town Galaxy cinema. Samay misses the the train back home and his parents get worried. They find at the police station that he is sleeping in the Amreli railway station.
Samay starts breaking into the cinema hall to watch movies without paying for the ticket. He gets thrown out of the cinema and meets Fazal. Samay ends up sharing his lunch with Fazal.

Soon, Samay starts playing with discarded projection reels and he even starts ""filming"" scenes with his friends as he saw in the movies. He learns the art of cinematography. Fazal teaches him how to splice the projection reels and to work the projectors.

As a result, cinemas all over the region get incomplete movies and there are riots.Problems mount when Bapuji won't pay Samay's school fees as he has been skipping school and the owner of the cinema finds him in the projection room and throws him out.
Samay uses scrap metal to build a makeshift projector of his own in the abandoned railway station.The police eventually trace the theft of the reels to Chalala station, and the kids are caught by the police. They are arrested and taken to Juvenile detention. Bapuji eventually bails Samay out.

Despite peculiar elements of the apartment, including abandoned furnishings and a suspicious realtor, the two move in. On their first evening there, Noelle finds a tarot card, while Addie is plagued by nightmares.A mysterious girl shows up at the apartment, having previously been spotted by Noelle and Addie looking inside from the street. Initially posing as a realtor, she reveals that she is there to investigate notorious sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. She believes that the apartment was previously owned by Epstein, and suggests that crimes, including child prostitution and murder, may have taken place there. Noelle and the girl begin to obsessively research conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's death and his alleged activities, and eventually begin a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, Addie becomes psychologically disturbed, seemingly as a result of living in the apartment. She wanders the streets of New York in a daze. During sex with her boyfriend Greg, she asks him to pretend they are on Epstein's 'Lolita Express' private plane, and engages in age-play, demanding Greg to treat her like she is 13 years old in a voice that is not her own; she has no memory of the events immediately afterward. She also masturbates to images of Prince Andrew, who was an associate of Epstein's, while dressing and behaving childishly.Noelle and the girl's research reveals two other Epstein properties five blocks away from the apartment on either side; Noelle suggests a connection to the pentagram. The girl reveals that she also found a tarot card, this one in Addie's bedroom. The two visit a 'magical apothecary' to discover the meaning behind the cards, whose owner warns them to leave the apartment immediately and gives them an obsidian crystal for protection. They return to the apartment to find Addie, still seemingly entranced and sexually obsessed with Prince Andrew. Noelle and the girl visit the Metropolitan Correctional Center where Epstein died, only to find Addie there, dressed similarly to a young girl pictured in a photo with Epstein. The two meet Greg at his work and learn the story of the bizarre sexual encounter between him and Addie.The girl suggests that Addie is a victim of CIA mind control experiments, similar to Project MKUltra. Describing Addie as a 'liability', the girl implies that she should be killed, which Noelle angrily rejects. The girl returns to the apartment to find the door chained shut, and evidence of Addie's masturbatory activities. She flees to the apartment's basement to find Addie before a large poster of The Sun tarot card, which includes depictions of nude children. When she discovers the girl's presence, Addie knocks her unconscious and begins to abuse her physically and sexually. She is interrupted by the arrival of Noelle, who kills her by stabbing her repeatedly with a knife. She returns to the apartment to meet the realtor who first showed them the apartment; their conversation implies that Addie's death was a planned part of a Satanic ritual.The girl regains consciousness and finds Noelle in the apartment. Noelle attacks her and attempts to kill her, but the girl fights back, bashing Noelle's skull with the obsidian crystal. She flees to Greg's workplace, but when the two return together, the apartment and the basement are empty and clean, with no bodies or evidence of a struggle. Greg leaves angrily. The girl returns to the apartment to find an anonymous note, telling her that the events she experienced are a warning for her to give up her investigations.

She sells peanuts to supplement the family income. Her mom Shanti (Swati Das) wants to take up stitching to help earn more money, but her dad refuses point blank as he thinks women are only fit for menial jobs.
Mahesh (Anurag Arora) is the school headmaster.London-bred advertising executive Jessica (Amy Maghera) arrives in the village to learn more about her late father's childhood. She stays at a local lodge run by Vikram (Ankit Rao).

Jessica learns more about Prerna and buys her a new school uniform, so she can attend school. Jessica posts the video of the handmade skateboard on her friends chat group and gets many instant reactions.Soon enough, Prerna and the other local children are introduced to an exciting new adventure thanks to Jessica and her old friend Erick (Jonathan Readwin) who cruises into town on a skateboard. After some encouragement Erick tutors Prerna on how to ride the skateboard. The kids beg Erick to stay around longer to teach them properly.
Prerna uses the school computer to watch skating videos online. She was practicing near the village pond and drops the board in the water, which destroys it. She offers to pay Erick with money that she stole from her father, but Erick refuses and says its OK.
Meanwhile her dad catches her when she was putting the money back and slaps her for stealing from her own home.

Meanwhile Jessica is getting pressure from her boss to get back to her job in London. Kids are arrested by the local cop (Sahidur Rahaman) for violating the law and are only released when Jessica promises that the kids will not miss school going forward.
The main objection of the villagers is the kids from untouchable castes are playing in the streets, where they have no business.Determined to empower and encourage their newfound passion, Jessica sets out on an uphill battle to build the kids their own skate-park. Erick goes to Bangalore to assemble his team. Jessica tries to get funding from the local MLA and sports body but gets no help as there is nothing in it for them. Vikram takes her to Maharani (Waheeda Rehman). Jessica narrates the story of Prerna, who has no dreams and no aspirations as she has never been taught to dream. Maharani is moved by the story and cautions Jessica that change is a dangerous thing in India, when led by a woman. She agrees to fund the entire project.
Erick's team and Maharani's funding means that the skate-park is ready quickly.The MLA announces a national skating championship to link his name to the project. The competition is in 3 months. The experts from Bangalore teach a few tricks to the kids. Prerna practices day and night and even gets injured in the process. Prerna's dad Ramkesh (Ambrish Saxena) confronts Jessica and tells her to stay away from his kids as he is afraid that if Prerna gets a serious injury, nobody will marry her. But Shanti figures that Prerna is really passionate about skating and takes her back to Jessica. She continues to practice but hides it from her dad.A boy from upper caste, who studies with Prerna at school, develops feelings for her and asks her out. But Ramkesh finds out that she visited the local fair with the upper caste Brahman boy. He confronts Prerna. He burns her skateboard. Its one week before the competition and Prerna is distraught.
Ramkesh fixes her marriage, and the wedding is scheduled in 1 week, on the day of the competition.
Prerna is left with a difficult choice between conforming to society's expectations of her or living out her dream of competing in the National Skateboarding Championships. On the day of the wedding, Prerna tells Ankush that she wants to skate one last time. Ankush helps Prerna to run away from the wedding venue to the skating rink, where the championship is taking place. He even gives her his own skateboard, so she can compete.
Prerna climbs out of the roof to escape. When the wedding party arrives, Shanti figures out that Prerna has escaped.Maharani was on the way to the venue in her car and finds Prerna skating towards it. She gives Prerna a lift. Her parents also reach there but decide not create a ruckus in public. Prerna performs in the championship. Maharani recognizes Prerna's courage and gives her a special award in front of the entire audience, including her parents.

She takes her unwilling granddaughter, to follow her. No one knows her secret. Almost a century ago, her family lived on that island. They were refugees as well, who came from Smyrna after the destruction of the city. Filio starts reading her grandmothers recipe book, which also served as a diary and includes information of what happened to Filio Baltatzis.Through the interesting saga of an eminent Smyrniot family, the spectator is transferred to the legendary city of Smyrna.

It mixes footage from the road, behind the scenes interviews, and personal material. On the tour, Pink played 156 shows in 18 countries.She travels by a private jet with her husband (Carey Hart) and 2 children (Willow Stage Hart and Jameson Moon Hart). She is in Amsterdam, 20 days to go to the massive concert at Wembley stadium in London, the biggest on tour. She has to rehearse before every performance.
Moms give up careers (they stop touring) after having kids as it's just easier for men to walk out the door and not look back. But Women can't do that (they worry about the kids all the time, to a point where they can't sleep). Pink is dragging her family all over the world as she believes they are making memories together. She wants her fan to enjoy her shows, and her kids to enjoy their time together. She is killing herself to do both.Pink's parents were divorced, and her father took her to her first stage performance. She wasn't exciting. But deep down she knew that she was on her way to becoming this huge star. Dad was very encouraging and told her not to care about what anyone thought.
every performance has to be meticulously thought through, right down to the color and details of the costumes. She takes her family to all her rehearsals.
She kept a journal every day she was pregnant. At first the kids idolize their parents, who love them unconditionally. And then the parents fall from grace, with kids realizing that their parents are mere humans, with their own flaws etc. You struggle through that for 10 yrs, and then the kids become the parents for their parents.In between the rehearsals and the shows, Pink spends precious time with her kids, and parenting them. Singing and dancing on stage are 2 different things and it's very hard to do them both together. She is the boss on stage and has to decide what happens step by step. She had to lead by example to get people to respect her.
She is very hard on herself and wants people to always get their money's worth. Post show she goes over all the things that went wrong, or could be better, with her team. She discusses the stage design that makes her run for 2 hours, up and down the ramps. She suggests design changes to the stage, to make the whole show work better for her and for the fans.
But the new stage design might not be approved by Wembley stadium. Changes are approved by Wembley eventually.15 days to Wembley. The troupe moves to Manchester. Willow wants to attend summer camp and asks for permission to go back home for a week and rejoin the tour later.
Willow is a sensitive girl, but free spirited. She feels neglected around Jameson. Jameson is a walking, naked loose screw. Equally committed to his anger and joy. Pink's mom saved her money and took her to the opera. Most of Pink's stage designs are inspired by her learning from that experience. Her parents supported her with singing, gymnastics, and taught her to work harder. Pink got inspired in gymnastics after a Cher concert and decided to be the first singer who can do both on stage. It quickly became her thing.When kids get sick, she has to stay away so that she doesn't get sick on tour. 8 days to Wembley and the troupe lands in Cardiff. Carey and Pink have been together for 19 yrs. He supports Pink fully and Pink appreciates that she doesn't need to stoke his ego as much. Carey is an incredible dad and very patient. He complements Pink fully. Carey was a dirt bike champion before he married Pink.Pink likes the continuity on her team. She doesn't audition new people. She encourages people who are better than her to be with her on stage. Her kids gel well with her entourage. She is personally invested in the well-being on her staff.
She has had injuries on stage, while doing the gymnastics stuff. Media appreciates that Pink is all about hard work and dedication to her craft. which has made her overcome insurmountable odds like divorced parents and a generally indifferent society. Her fans love her for being different and for being a role model to those who don't fit. Without knowing Pink has touched millions of lives around the globe.2 days to Wembley and Pink travels to Brussels and then back to London. Wembley is on. 1:30 leave for venue, lunch with the family on the bus. Practice at the venue. 4 30, hair and makeup. She does her own hair. Vocal cords practice. 7 15, physical warm-ups. 80K people in the stadium. A little team prayer before the show. 8 20 pm, drive to the stage. The show is a massive hit.
After the show, Pink still spends time chasing around Jameson and trying to be a good mother to him. Carey leaves with Willow to take her to summer camp. Alecia Beth Mooney.The film is produced by Michael Gracey and Isabella Parish, with Luminaries, Silent House, and Lefty Paw Print.","A behind-the-scenes look at P!NK as she balances family and life on the road, leading up to her first Wembley Stadium performance on 2019's ""Beautiful Trauma"" world tour."

Three sets of couples - Ben and Liam in New York City, Evan and Jen in West Hollywood, and Oliver and Mia in Los Angeles' Venice neighborhood - are joined by friend Harper in Austin, Texas on a four way online birthday party for Evan via Zoom. The group agrees to take a designer drug that Oliver has had delivered to each home. After taking the pill, during a brief verbal argument, Jen falls backward, hits her head and appears to be dead.As the drugs take a firm hold on the friends, their decision making skills are severely hampered. Fearing that the authorities will think Evan killed her (they themselves are unsure, as none were paying attention to their screens when Jen tripped), the friends help Evan run when a neighbor calls the police. As Oliver drives cross town to Evan, Harper shares that Jen had secretly told her she was pregnant, and planned to tell Evan after the party. Evan reaches his own car and heads for Oliver's, and the group is stunned to see how the pandemic has caused the conditions to deteriorate on the streets of Los Angeles, including military roadblocks.With Evan having broken the strict curfew, the police escalate a search for him. When the police search Oliver's house, Evan leaves in Oliver's car. Mia convinces Oliver that she should contact her abusive ex-boyfriend, who is a top criminal lawyer. He advises Evan to drive to the Hollywood police station and wait for Danny to arrive, and to say nothing until he gets there. However, he is pulled over by the police before he arrives. Unable to think clearly, and ignoring the advice of Danny and all his friends, Evan disobeys the police orders and gets out of the car, raising his hands with his Zoom enabled phone, leading to Evan being shot.As Evan lays dying on the street, the feed from Evan and Jen's house shows her regain consciousness and sit up. She and Evan speak of the baby and their love for each other. Evan dies, witnessed by all the friends. Jen screams in agony, as the news radio show in Oliver's car relays that Evan's death is dwarfed by the 2 million Covid deaths that day, bringing the death toll to 253 million, with the United Kingdom becoming the seventh major superpower to cease to exist as a coherent nation.(copied from Wikipedia)","Two years into the pandemic, a group of friends throw a wild online party.

Jenny and her son Andrew visit Detroit, where her family is originally from as well as the place Victor resided and passed. After a brief meeting and introduction to Jenny's family, the mother, Helen, is drawn out to be cold and distant, while the father is supposed to be caring. It is revealed through random dream sequences, that Jenny is actually a triplet, and her other brother, Andrew, has passed before Victor did. Jenny's aunt, Joan, who is oddly religiously affectionate throughout the film offers to let Jenny to stay with her father while Victor's car is getting fixed - Joan stated that Victor wanted Jenny to have the car - after Jenny declined wanting to ask to stay with her mother. Jenny then asks Joan if she could stay in Victors condo, and Joan allows her to. Jenny and Joan arrive at the condo, and Jenny just so happens to know where Victor keeps his alcohol because ""it's where she would've put it"". After a conversation full of nothing between Joan and Jenny, Jenny looks through Victors art, finds his phone, and finds a tin box with a handgun, and a picture. The picture has indistinguishable handwriting on it, and she visits the place written on the back of the picture. The location is an art bar - the owner, Tanja, is Victors ex girlfriend. Another conversation full of nothing happens, and Jenny goes home after the encounter. A brief segment introduces a character named Kash, placed in a recording studio. The whole scene deals with Kash recording a song. After this, Kash and a man appear at the art bar. They discuss Kash's future career, and as Tanja approaches, the man states that he can't wait to work with Tania's boyfriend; the art bar has Victor's work hanging all over the bar, and his alias is 'Gonzo'. After the man tells Tanja that he can't wait to work with her boyfriend, she leaves distraught, and is followed out by Kash, where yet a conversation full of a whole lot of nothing happens again. After Victor's car is fixed, Jenny takes Andrew back home, where she walks in on her husband Mark hooking up with a woman, where they then have an argument implying that Mark had been chronically cheating on Jenny. Jenny and Andrew then come back up to Detroit, and stay at Victors condo. In the art bar, as well as finding Victor's phone, Jenny is informed that a show is coming up featuring Victor's art, and about another upcoming show featuring Kash being signed to a label. Jenny attends the party, and talks to Tanja about a whole lot of nothing, when a woman pulls Tanja to the side and tells her that Jenny shouldn't be here tonight because it just isn't right. After their conversation, Kash is introduced to speak in front of the audience at the show, says a whole lot of nothing, and then starts rapping indistinctly. It fades out, and Kash meets Jenny outside of Victor's condo, where Kash also lives. They go inside, talk about a whole lot of nothing, and the next day comes. Tanja and Jenny are walking through the woods, when Tanja reveals that the night Victor crashed his car, Kash was driving, but when the car was found, Victor was in the drivers seat. Jenny then theorizes that Kash and Victor may have swapped spots after stopping at a gas station, but is left to her own thoughts. Jenny then decides to speak to her father about what he would do if one of them were in trouble, and he states that he would do anything it takes. After that, Jenny texts Kash to let her pick him up before his signing party because she wanted to talk to him. After picking him up, Jenny drives around, then asks Kash to drive because of her high heels. After a while, Jenny throws her shoes off and it hits a box in the backseat, which is the box that held the gun and the picture. She takes the gun out and makes Kash drive to the location where the accident happened, and forces Kash to confess at gun point while he also gaslights her for no reason. After doing what they do best - talking a whole lot of nothing - Kash insists that Jenny shoot him if it's his time to go, to where he walks past Jenny, and she then pops to caps in his back. Jenny then walks back to the car, leaving him there, and drives to Victor's condo, where she suffers a breakdown and eats a cinnamon roll while the police knock down the door, ending the film there.","A young mother returns to her estranged hometown of Detroit after the sudden death of her twin brother and immerses herself in his friend group, soon discovering that his death is not what it seems."

He struggles with his inclinations, often leading to serious trouble. The idea for the movie began when the real-life history of law enforcement in this case seemed almost like slapstick comedy. A victim escaped, only to be returned to Dahmer by the police. Also, the smell of rotting flesh was explained as the result of a refrigerator breaking. The list goes one. The director consulted with his fans who are gay because he didn't want the dark humor of the parody to be insulting. One such fan actually dated a man who was recently arrested - he is a real serial killer. The fan explained that there is prejudice against gays in law enforcement, which results in crimes not being properly investigated. Whether or not this is true, it provides perfect motivation for the fictional characters in the movie to be bungling fools. It's sad that the real-life foolish behavior might have a basis in hatred.

In 1959 a group of nine student hikers were attempting a difficult winter expedition in the remote Ural Mountains of Russia, when a mysterious event led to their horrific deaths, shocking the nation.
The Soviet Government and fellow students uncovered the grizzly remains of the hikers. Found a mile from their shredded tent, the hikers seemingly flew into the freezing temperatures without their winter clothes or boots. Adding to the gruesome mystery, many of their bodies had suffered brutal and inexplicable injuries, and some even showed traces of radiation.
The investigators at the time, under pressure from the Soviet Government closed the case, stating that the hikers died from ""An Unknown Compelling Force"".
For more than 60 years the story has been shrouded in mystery and conspiracy theories, suggesting everything from UFOs and murder to a Soviet Government cover-up. This documentary features interviews with Russian investigators and experts, a former Moscow Times journalist, and friends of the hikers.
Adding a new perspective to the case, British filmmaker Liam Le Guillou travels to Russia to speak to those who knew the hikers and the team attempts to reach the very location of the Dyatlov Pass Incident in a dangerous winter expedition.

Soon enough, the woman is killed for being in possession of the necklace.
Cut to some time later and a group of college kids are on a trip with their professor Dr Dennis.
The rest of the group consists of Chris, Jake, Isabella, Lilly and Oz.
Chris and Isabella are dating and the rest of the group finds Chris too annoying to hang out with.
When a skeleton of a woman wearing a necklace is found, Isabella wants to report it but doing so would cause the trip to be cut short and the group will have to have their lessons in a classroom rather than go on an excursion and get some real-life experience... To look for the sasquatch. Isabella however removes the necklace from the skeleton and keeps it.
And of course, they choose a time in the year known as the Dead Month where Big Foot sightings have been known to increase.
Lilly is the group's ""I'm going to roll my eyes at everyone"" character. She has enough attitude for everyone to avoid her and most of them do except for the boyfriend from the first scene whose name was Everett.
He kidnaps Lilly and ties her up to lure the monster. She hurls a couple of insults at him but Everett couldn't be bothered.
Meanwhile, Isabella is attacked by a beast and when she returns it is clear she is possessed.
More people die including the professor.
The beasts make it into the cabin where they are staying and Chris has to hide around the house.
Lilly manages to escape and come to the house only to tell Chris she is going to save her own skin and he can come or not. Chris wants to be a hero and try to save anyone else left in the group. There is no one left so he escapes with Lilly who did stay back for him after all.
She isn't rewarded for her kind gesture and when Chris and she are attacked, she is ripped apart and is left screaming in pain while Chris asks her to look at him. She doesn't and dies.The monster beasts close in and Chris readies himself for a battle but before that, the Wendigo and Sasquatch get into a fight. Bigfoot kills all the monsters.
Chris gets to escape only to be accosted by Isabella who jumps in front of his car.
The car doesn't start and Chris doesn't bother with rolling up the windows. So Isabella makes a grab for him and he gets out and jumps to the back of the truck where there is a canister of gasoline. And matches.
Isabella is set on fire and Chris ends up with his pants on fire which he quickly removes.
He is about to leave again but Everett comes, possessed by the Wendigo.
Everett is beheaded by Chris with the shovel he holds.Chris now has to hike back home, pantless but fortunately, there is a car going by and an old man asks what happened.
Dead month says the driver.
Everyone knows about it. People go missing in the woods all the time. But the authorities can hardly be bothered and don't discourage adventurers.

A portal of red light activates, and a ship flies through, emerging out of a mountainside and flying over a forest.Glen Craven (Tim Wade), and Lily Lantz (Emily Sweet), are young UFO investigators preparing to document the phenomenon of strange lights and reports of alien activity on Mount Adams, Washington. They speak at a UFO convention, outlining the plan for their next expedition and what they expect to find.The next day they head out, bringing along their camera crew and assistants. On the first day, they conduct interviews with the locals living around the mountain. They are warned to be careful of the red lights and what comes out of them.Before they head to the mountain they meet up with their guide, Ranger Bill Jefferson (Greg James). He takes them to a closed-off trail and tells them that no one is allowed farther up because people have been going missing. Determined to get as close to the phenomena as possible, Lily bribes the ranger to lead them up the mountain.The trail quickly deteriorates until there is no clear path to follow. The team accuses Ranger Bill of being lost, but he assures them that he knows the way. That night they set up camp and the team heads up to a rocky peak to get some footage. They observe the lights, which look like a portal, and the cameraman Blake (Phillip Wade) catches an alien ship on camera.The excited team trek back down to camp, where they discover that Bill is missing. One of the team members, Kim, (Allesondra Helwig) finds Bill's shoe...but it's bloody. The team's radios can't reach anyone off the mountain, so they decide to hunker down for the night and look for Bill in the morning.The next morning Glen and his assistant Thomas (Matthew O'Donnell) find Bill's body. It looks like he was torn apart by an animal. The team panics. They don't know the way back, but they make the decision to pack up and head down the mountain without their guide.An alien bug crosses their path and bites Kim's leg. Thomas kills the creature.They set up camp for a second night. They joke around the fire until a clawed arm lunges out of the darkness and grabs Blake by the shoulder. He's dragged off into the woods, and his girlfriend Candie (Alysse Fozmark) gives chase a short way, screaming. Her screams draw the monster away from Blake but lead it to her. Candie is killed and dragged off into the woods. Blake is far from his team and lost in the night.In the morning what remains of the team pull themselves together and head out again. By nightfall they are still lost, so they set up camp with a cliff at their backs. Glen stays up on watch but starts to nod off. Three alien monsters close in on them while he sleeps. Glen wakes up just in time to spear one in the eye with a sharpened stick before it can grab him. The monsters leave, and the team waits until morning to leave.Meanwhile, Blake is out in the woods alone, searching for his team.Kim's leg is worse. She looks like she's fading. The team carries her as they try to find their way home. When the sun starts to set, Glen and Thomas search for a safe campsite. Thomas engages Glen in horseplay, causing him to slip off a cliffside. Glen's shoulder is wounded after he rolls to the base of the cliff. Shortly after, Thomas sees an old hunter's cabin and leaves Glen to get Lily and Kim.Blake is prepping to survive another night in the woods alone when he sees a red light in the distance. Thinking it's his team, he sets out toward it.The team is safe in the cabin as the sun sets, but Kim is still fading. Darkness falls. The three monsters appear, closing in on the cabin.Blake finds the source of the light and discovers it's not his team's campfire. It's an alien portal.

I was already hooked to the beauty of the underwater world, but it was here that these 3 inspired my love for Sharks and I followed in their footsteps with my lifelong fight to protect these magnificent creatures.
In this new epic documentary ""Playing With Sharks"", Valerie takes us on an amazing journey into her own teen years as a spearfishing champion, her romance with the sea and also with Ron, who made her his underwater model and later his wife. We see the couple embarking on an expedition that changed their lives forever. From spearfishing champions, they soon became world famous for their filming and production of underwater documentaries.
The Taylors traveled around the world filming sharks and educating the general public about the huge misconception that these awesome creatures are mindless killing machines in a time when sharks were labelled as Man-eaters following the release of ""Jaws"". They became protectors and defenders of our oceans and the creatures that live in it.
Their hard work soon started giving rewards as Australia became the first country in the world to protect the Grey Nurse Shark (Carcharias taurus). This was later followed by conservation measures for: the Potato Cod (Grouper) and Cod hole, The Sea lions, the Coral Sea bird breeding islands, the main breeding grounds of the Southern Right Whales becoming a marine reserve and also protection of the Great White Shark.This amazing woman's incredible lifelong journey is not over yet as Valerie, now 85, and following Ron's death in 2012, is still involved in conservation issues and still dives to spend time surrounded by and Playing With Sharks.","Pioneering scuba diver Valerie Taylor, who has dedicated her life to exposing the myth surrounding our fear of sharks."

When President Helen Colton (Wendy Hartman) arrived at the G-7 summit in Brussels, Belgium she was facing an international crisis with Russia's annexation of Crimea. But no sooner did she land when Elisabeth Seward (Stephanie Eaton), her National Security Advisor, informed her that General John Reager (Paul Noonan), the Commander of Air Force Space Command, wanted an immediate unscheduled meeting.As Colton and Seward secretly descend into a nearby bunker, Reager is reviewing the slide presentation he is about to give to the leader of the free world with the assistance of Major Ellen Sampson (Patience McStravick) of Space and Missile Systems Center. But just as Reager advises Sampson on the nuances of Presidential diplomacy, their stoic world is interrupted by Cedric Yonah (Conor Timmis), accompanied by James Griffin (Chris Goodwin). Incensed by the intrusion of a civilian, Reager's start of an interrogation falls short when Colton arrives and takes command of the moment.Awkward introductions present Yonah as a science advisor to Colton. But Reager immediately locks horns with the mysterious Yonah who comes across as neither present nor absent. Was it Yonah's mid-thirties looks, Nehru styled suit and flagrant disrespect that bothered Reager or was it is Reager's four-star uniform that represented military power and overconfidence that offset Yonah?
With time short Colton instructs Reager to get on with his presentation. In military precision with each passing slide, Reager builds to the moment of revelation - an alien satellite is parked at LaGrange Point 2 (a point in space where the gravity of moon, earth and sun creates an equilibrium point and allows a satellite to just hang there and observe the 2 space bodies). Discovered when Sampson's unit intercepted an alien signal through a military satellite (coming from LaGrange Point 2), the decoded signal reveals all Earth orbiting satellites (3500 satellites orbiting the Earth, plus over 500,000 pieces of space debris), military and civilian air traffic (more than 100,000 flights each yr) and weather forecasting models. But its greatest reveal-a flight plan of an unknown aircraft. The aliens are already here.
Reagar reveals that he had sent an experimental spacecraft towards LaGrange 2, which took pics of the extra-terrestrial satellite sending the signal. But the satellite retreated (it had anti gravity propulsion systems) when the earth space craft approached, and is untraceable since then. All this happened in Aug, its June of the following yr now.James Griffin leaves the meeting at this point.
Shocked by its revelation, Colton's attempts to learn more results in a confrontation between Reager and Yonah who are both protecting their worlds. Ellen continues to say that the alien satellite continues to send signals via x-ray transmission to Earth. These signals terminated in the Atlantic ocean and have no apparent receiver. Yonah argues that the alien craft could have been in orbit for a yr or for a 1000 yrs.
But what world is Yonah protecting? When an exasperated Reager literally orders Colton to sign a worldwide surveillance order to track down this alien presence, Yonah erupts into an impassioned plea citing world history and the oppression of millions based on fear of the unknown.
Reager argues that the war has already begun, while Yonah argues that the aliens are simply watching the humans. So this is a time for observation and learning, not war.
The speech falls cold on Reager who dismisses Yonah as a pacifist. A reluctant Colton signs OPERATION Troy giving Reager near unlimited resources and funding to identify this alien threat. Upon signing, it's Seward and Sampson that see Yonah go blank as he relives the horrors and sounds of a war fought over seventy years ago-a war he was in.As the meeting disbands, a dejected Yonah accepts a ride by an empathetic Sampson under a previous order by Reager to learn more about him. As Reager leaves, Colton finds herself alone with Seward and informs her that she's been aware of an alien presence on Earth since she assumed office. A stunned Seward follows Colton's instructions to have two other world leaders (Prime Minister Allison Colby (Lindy Nettleton) of the UK and President Sergei Tupolov (Yefim Somin) of Russia) join her to implement a plan to stop Reager before he inadvertently starts a war of biblical proportions. She says she signed the order as she feared a plot by Reager to use this ploy to wrest military control away from civilian hands.
Colton reveals that she knew Yonah is an alien and has been on Earth for several yrs. Colton knows that both sides of the conflict now know each other and are set for conflict. She also knows that public opinion is against the aliens, even if the aliens have been humanity's friend for decades (and across the 2 world wars).. Colton tries to figure out how to support the aliens without letting Hadrian or Reager know, or dismissing them.Reager goes to a Belgian air base and reports to Senator Paul Hadrian (Michael Anthony Coppola). Apparently Reager was working on behalf of Hadrian. Hadrian is reviewing footage from Reager's meeting with the president, which shows Yonah as a blur, while everyone else is clearly visible. It is implied that Yonah is the alien.
Hadrian and Reager discuss the development of prototype planes that can fly fast enough to catch up with alien space craft. Hadrian also plans to use intelligence from TROY to shape his Presidential bid in the upcoming elections to defeat Colton.With OPERATION Troy now implemented, a nervous Yonah directs Sampson not to an airfield, but an actual field. As they awkwardly exit her vehicle and begin a slow methodical walk, Yonah attempts to recruit Sampson in a vain attempt for assistance to find his missing people and to defy Reager. He claims that he was the one who sent the signal and the signal did not come from deep space. He also questions Sampson on how Reager had the knowledge to Decrypt the signal in the first place.
Bewildered, angry and fearing a plot, Sampson states the she cannot pledge allegiance to Yonah on his words alone. Yonah reveals that 1947 was the Roswell incident and 1972 was when the Apollo mission was ended. he reveals that his species got involved with Earth after WW II, as Earth technology was not progressing fast enough. The aliens wanted a back-up for their technology and knowledge. So, Yonah joined the German rocket effort at Peenemunde. When he learned what the German's were up to, he stopped, and was sent to a concentration camp. After the war, the German rocket engineers went to US to work on the Apollo program.
The aliens developed surveillance technology to keep an eye on humans and that's when one of their planes went down in Roswell. Humans reached the moon in 1969, and first contact was made then. Aliens were supposed to meet UNSC in 1972, to reveal their existence, but the military never brought them to that meeting. Those aliens were Yonah's parents and he has been searching for them ever since. He tells Sampson that US military has enough nukes to destroy the world 10 times over as they know they are not alone and are paranoid. and now Reager will build an surveillance network to end humanity as we know it.It is in that moment than an unknown aircraft (looks like an oversized SR-71 Blackbird) reveals itself. Shocked and confused, Sampson's attempt to understand begs her to ask ""Where are you from?"" When Yonah responds ""Earth"" he hopes Sampson's confusion abates with a gift that only NASA can authenticate - the plaque from Apollo 11 that states - we came in peace for all mankind. No sooner does she look up to thank him and a warping of air is all that's left of Yonah and the mysterious aircraft.",When Air Force Space Command receives a signal from an alien satellite in Earth orbit an emergency meeting with the President reveals a government conspiracy.

By night, he transformed into drag queen Mrs. Kasha Davis. Not your average aspiring pop star drag queen, Mrs. Kasha Davis is a 1960's era housewife trying to liberate herself from domestic toil through performing at night in secret - an homage to Ed's own mother. After seven years of auditioning to compete on reality television show RuPaul's Drag Race, Ed Popil was finally cast onto the show and thrust into a full time entertainment career at the late age of 44. Workhorse Queen explores the complexities of mainstream television's impact on queer performance culture. In addition to following Ed's life and career before and after being cast onto RuPaul's Drag Race, the film focuses on the growing divide between members of a small town drag community - those who have been on television, and those who have not. Throughout the film, Ed Popil navigates the exciting highs and devastating lows of pursuing the fame promised by a reality television platform. With one foot inching toward Hollywood's doorstep and the other cemented firmly within her beloved Rochester community, Mrs. Kasha Davis finds a surprising new audience at home as she works toward becoming the queer role model for children that Ed didn't have and desperately wanted growing up."

With a bright-red lantern in hand, he climbs a tall ladder to investigate a mysterious noise. Before he is able to finish his search, he is attacked by an unknown force and knocked off the ladder. His fate is unknown.Later at Brooke's Hardware Store, the impatient and overbearing general manager named Brian desperately pressures Gene, the exuberant assistant manager, to hire anybody to help out during the Black Friday season, insisting it does not matter who it is.Then, Sam Coleman, an anxious young man, attempts to apply for a job in a drive-thru line, but is comically rejected. He sits in his car, giving up hope of ever finding a job, when suddenly his phone rings. Gene offers Sam a job at Brooke's Hardware Store, which Sam gleefully accepts.Sam rushes to Brooke's, where Gene shows him a training video and gives him a tour. During the tour, Gene and Sam find Brian suspiciously locking the warehouse that Keith entered in the opening scene. Gene brushes it off, and then introduces Sam to a sarcastic coworker named Sarah, who quickly trains Sam and shows him that she does not take her job very seriously. Sam spends his first shift alone on the register. He then realizes how easy the job is going to be and definitively decides to keep the position.The next morning, Sam returns and joyfully works his shift, eventually meeting a strange and awkward coworker named Bill. He bonds with Sarah in the break room, revealing to her that he is in community college and eventually wants to transfer to medical school. Sarah warns Sam that Brooke's is a creepy store, and he should not let the job take over his life. As if to prove Sarah's point, later that evening Sam finds Gene creepily staring at a wall in his office while the lights flicker ominously. Sam is freaked out, and he leaves his shift feeling uneasy.However, the next morning, Gene arrives at work in a jolly mood, which eases Sam's fears. Working in a new section, Sam tries to locate Sarah, but finds a strange pile of bubbling black goo instead. Later, Brian finds Sam and orders him to finish out his shift in the gardening section. There, Sam encounters a creepy customer, who is not moving in the aisle. Sam tries to talk to him, but the creepy customer does not speak back, and attempts to grab Sam's walkie-talkie. Sarah rescues Sam and warns him that she sees the same strange customer always hanging around, and he should be avoided. Sam's fears about Brooke's continue to grow.During his next shift, Sam tries to see if the creepy customer is still there, but instead finds another puddle of black goo. Attempting to find something to clean up the goo, Sam wanders into an eerie supply closet lit by a piercing red light. Sam finds a journal written by an old employee, which is full of messages warning about the hidden evils of Brooke's. Sam shows the journal to Sarah, who realizes it was written by Keith, her old coworker who mysteriously disappeared from work. After some debate, they decide to break into Gene's office to find Keith's employee file and figure out what happened, but find that Keith's file is empty.
Then, Bill surprisingly informs them that Brian hides secret files in a closet near his office. Despite Sarah telling Sam to wait for her, Sam decides to explore the closet by himself. After finding the closet locked, Sam is caught by Brian, who threatens to fire him for sneaking around. Sam is shaken by the encounter, and has an emotional moment with Sarah. However, Gene cheers Sam up by offering him a full time position at Brooke's.The following day, Sam tells Sarah that he wants to accept Gene's offer. Sarah tells him not to throw his life away working at such a miserable job. They argue, but when they are stopped by Gene, Sam spitefully accepts his full time offer in front of Sarah. Sarah angrily reveals to Gene that they sneaked into his office to figure out what happened to Keith, but Gene reassures them that nothing is wrong by showing them Keith's file. It says that Keith received minor injuries from his fall but is otherwise unharmed. Sam cowardly takes no responsibility for also breaking into Gene's office, so Gene writes a report to Brian about Sarah breaking the rules.The next morning, Bill shocks Sam by revealing that he overheard Brian firing Sarah over the phone. Sam confronts Brian about it, but Brian only mocks him. Sam is infuriated and decides to attempt to find out what is in the secret closet again. He pays Bill to distract Brian, and steals Brian's keys to the secret closet. He breaks in, and to his horror, he finds Keith's real file which reveals the truth: Keith was killed on the job and Brian covered it up. Sam is horrified, and he hatches a plan to destroy Brooke's for all of its corruption.With Gene's backup, Sam convinces Brian to let him be in charge of the store for Black Friday. Brian miserably explains to the whole crew on the morning of Black Friday that they have to hit a certain quota, or the store will go under. Just as the Black Friday rush is at its peak, Sam's plan begins. He tells Bill and a new set of temp workers hired by Brian to go home, and then sabotages Gene working at the register. Enraged, Gene horrifically scratches his own face, scaring Sam and the remaining customers. Gene runs away to his office as all the customers rush out of the store, leaving Sam to celebrate his victory taking down the corrupt Brooke's Hardware.The film then cuts to a flashback showing more of what happened in the opening scene. Keith is revealed confronting Brian in his office, attempting to put an end to Brooke's Hardware Store's corruption, just like Sam. He steals Brian's keys, locking him in his office, and enters the warehouse to find proof of Brian's wrongdoing. Keith is now seen from Brian's perspective being pushed off the ladder and killed by mysterious figures. Brian screams at Keith to stop, but he is too late. He sobs to himself.In the present day, Brian confronts Sam about sabotaging Black Friday. As he yells at Sam, the film cuts back and forth to Gene in his office, staring at the wall again in an inhuman way. Brian tells Sam that he is not the evil one, that all he has ever done is try to keep his employees safe. Gene then screams at the wall to tell him what to do. Brian tells Sam that he only fired Sarah to keep her safe, as she would have been punished if she discovered the truth. Then, as Gene is sitting in silence, he finally hears something communicate back to him. He then listens as the wicked voice of the Brooke's loudspeaker announcer supernaturally gives him instructions from behind the wall, and he becomes ecstatic and exits his office.Brian worriedly gives Sam his keys. As Brian screams at Sam to keep the doors locked and ""keep feeding them,"" Gene appears, and brutally murders Brian with a hammer. Gene hits the chains off of the warehouse and shadowed figures drag Brian's body into the warehouse. Absolutely terrified, Sam runs for his life, until he encounters the creepy customer from earlier, and yells at him to get out of the store for his safety. However, Gene appears, and reveals that the customer is on his side, and he begs Sam to join them. Confused and terrified, Sam slashes at the customer with his box cutter as he walks towards him. The same black goo that Sam had found in the store earlier leaks out of the customer's hand. Sam realizes the customer is not human, and he slashes the creature's neck, killing him.Gene is enraged, and screams at the store for help. Suddenly, dozens of mysterious demonic creatures emerge from behind the walls, and chase down Sam with Gene at the lead. Sam finds refuge in the closet lit by the red light, which seems to repel Gene and the creatures. Sam begs for an explanation, and Gene goes on to tell him that he has been guiding a group of lost demonic souls by growing new bodies for them in exchange for his own power. He explains they all have been feeding off the store for decades, but now that Brian is dead and Brooke's will go bankrupt, they will be free to escape into the world and conquer anything in their path. He tells Sam that if he gives them the keys to set them free, he can join them and live an eternal life of purpose. Sam is about to comply out of fear, but then remembers his human bond with Sarah and his desire to fight for himself. He refuses to give up the keys. But Gene runs to the power grid to turn off the red light. Thinking quickly, Sam fashions a lantern with the red light bulb like Keith did, keeping himself safe even without power. Gene runs into the room to kill Sam, but Sam ignites the lantern, and slashes Gene's throat. Gene falls to the ground and dies. Now surrounded by the creatures, Sam leaves Sarah a voicemail, apologizing for not sticking up for her and resolving to fight his way out in the face of death.Finding a hidden pool of courage, Sam grabs an ax and easily kills all of the demons in a rock 'n' roll montage, who are much weaker than they appear. Victorious, Sam hobbles out of Brooke's and says his final goodbyes to the defeated store. However, as he is exiting, one final demon runs out into the street. But Sarah is waiting outside after hearing Sam's voicemail, and kills the demon with a baseball bat. Sam and Sarah reconnect and celebrate, having finally taken down the evil of Brooke's Hardware Store. They light the store on fire, and look forward to the endless possibilities of life. The film ends with a page in Keith's journal that reads ""We did it, Keith,"" catching fire, as Sam and Sarah cheer at the store being engulfed in flames.","After starting a job at an eerie hardware store, an anxious young man uncovers a shocking mystery that leads to a fight against terrifying forces that lurk just behind the walls."

The film is based on three true stories. Two are based on the wild adventures of the producer's brother: a hiker who frequents the Great Smoky Mountains. The third story is based on the production company's own experiences: Big N Funky Productions' own possible run in with an infamous Native American legend while filming one of their paranormal TV shows.The movie starts off with one of the most unique horror movie intros ever: two scenes, deep in the wilderness, showing two different murders, one playing forward and one playing in reverse.The movie's main characters, Robin and Vinnie, are introduced next. They are driving into the remote forest for a three day hike. Robin is 3/4 Native American, and wants to show her boyfriend, Vinnie, a place in the National Park that was special to her when she was a little girl. Vinnie is obviously uncomfortable in the woods, but he is trying to be a decent guy. Vinnie starts clowning around, telling funny stories and trying to have a good time despite his disdain for the outdoors, when they start running into odd things in the woods.Robin finds a polaroid picture of a partially naked, bound woman with her face marked out. As disturbing as that is, they soon find other things in the woods that throws them off even more: an abandoned camera that contains disturbing images, more Polaroids of naked, bound people, an ancient necklace with a mysterious aura, and a stranger in the forest that seems to know them, but then vanishes.Things start to get surreal for the couple after they eat some potent 'shrooms before bedtime. Robin, dressed in Native regalia, appears before Vinnie and leads him to a cliff face where he almost falls off before being saved by another stranger. When they reunite on the main trail, Robin swears this was not her. The couple tries to find help from a forest ranger as more victims die in other parts of the forest and unidentified men are spying on nearly their every move.Robin and Vinnie stumble upon the Cherokee word U'tlun'ta written in blood in an abandoned cabin. Robin panics at first, but when she calms down she tells Vinnie about a Cherokee legend named Spearfinger: a rock golem with a long, obsidian finger that can shapeshift, manipulate nature, and eats her victim's livers after piercing their sides. This does not affect Vinnie, who assures her that things are gonna be OK.Eventually, a group of three, well armed, large men approach and threaten Robin and Vinnie at their campsite. The three men steal back the camera Robin found, and then the two groups separate after a heated discussion. Robin and Vinnie assume these three strangers are the reason for the disturbing Polaroids and try to hightail out of the woods.After a few hours, two of the three strangers, Luke and Travis, decide they need to follow Robin and Vinnie again and give chase. Robin and Vinnie have several close calls with them but successfully slip into a cave to hide. The couple spend the night in the cave, but once again, someone or something that resembles Robin appears to Vinnie and leads him off deeper into the cave on his own, leaving Robin in the cave by herself, with no flashlight. With everyone discombobulated, scared, angry, and at their wit's end, the final fight between good and evil takes place in the Great Smoky Mountains begging the question: Who will survive ""The Hike?""Critics have noted the beautiful scenery, wildly unpredictable plot, the humor, the dialogue and the tension. But ""The Hike"" is probably best described as, as one reviewer stated, "" Clerks in a horror movie set in the woods."" In addition to tension, gore, mystery, comedy, adult situations and the paranormal, the film features the longest four person fight scenes in cinematic history.","A couple from East Tennessee goes on a three day hike in the Great Smoky Mountains. The fun starts to dissipate when they start finding evidence of possible criminal activity scattered throughout the trails, and the deeper they plunge into the wilderness, the more they feel like they are being watched. Things take a turn for the worse when the couple runs into a trio of intimidating strangers. Their intentions are unclear, and the couple tries everything to escape the woods before violence ensues with their new adversaries. Eventually, another source of terror reveals itself, building up to the final fight between good and evil.—Val Dean Pouncie"

family farm with a dream to compete at the world championships in Alaska, his teenage exuberance seems to erase the tired
lines on his sixty-five year old face.Yet the demands of being a small-scale family farmer in a changing world are constant, and Doug has never once left his cows
for more than a few days. And behind the charming cocktail of racy anecdotes and repeated jokes is a darker picture than Doug
would ever choose to reveal.Keenly aware of the fate of the other family farms that used to dot the landscape, Doug has managed for years to play one
creditor off against the next to survive another season. But with the accumulated debt now insurmountable and Doug's
thoughts plunging into depression and suicide, his dogs offer solace. And perhaps a way out.On a cold March morning Doug pulls out of his driveway in a rusted-out truck carrying 22 dogs, tearily waving goodbye to the

Neuman mentions that Loki, the God of Mischief, created the mask and unleashed it on Earth in order to spread his chaos among mankind, and that those who wear the mask are granted his powers. When Neuman brings up Loki's punishment and imprisonment at Odin's hands, a stranger suddenly becomes furious and transforms, revealing himself to be Loki. The tourists panic and flee, but Neuman stays to argue with Loki, who takes the mask in the display case, only to realize it is a replica. In anger, he removes Neuman's face from his body and puts it in the case, before disposing of the arriving authorities and storming out of the museum in a rage.Meanwhile, the real mask makes its way to Fringe City and is found in a river by a dog named Otis - who belongs to Tim Avery, an aspiring animator at an animation studio, who is reluctant to accept parenthood with his wife, Tonya. On a tropical island, Loki is relaxing until Odin confronts and orders him to resume the search for the mask he had sent him on, as he believes it has caused too much chaos for mankind. Loki asks his father to help him, only for the latter to sternly say that he has to take responsibility for his actions. Later that night, Tim puts on the mask for a Halloween party held at the studio, becoming an eccentric, green-faced party animal. When the party turns out to be a bore, Tim uses his newfound powers to perform a remix of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"", making the party a success and giving Tim's boss, Daniel Moss, the inspiration for a new cartoon, resulting in his promotion the next day.Tim returns to his house that night and, while still wearing the mask, conceives a baby. The baby, Alvey, is born with the same powers as the mask, which alerts Odin. Possessing a store clerk, Odin informs Loki about this and tells him that if he finds the child, he will find the mask. Months later, Tonya goes on a business trip, leaving Tim with their son. Tim, now promoted, desperately tries to work on his cartoon at home, but is continuously disrupted by Alvey. In order to get some peace and quiet, Tim lets Alvey watch various cartoons on television. Alvey, whose intelligence is amplified by the mask, devilishly comes up with the idea to torment his father using his powers. Meanwhile, Otis, who has been feeling neglected by Tim because of Alvey, dons the mask by accident and becomes a wild version of himself, who tries to get rid of Alvey, but all of his attempts are foiled by the much craftier infant.Eventually, Loki, after searching from home to home for the baby and leaving a trail of mayhem in his wake, finds Alvey and confronts Tim for the mask back, but Alvey uses his powers to protect his father. Odin, possessing Tim's body, becomes fed up with Loki's destructive approach for defying him once again and strips his son of his powers. Tim is later fired after failing to impress Moss during a pitch, but is able to reconcile and bond with Alvey. Loki, still determined to please his father, sneaks into the Avery household that night and manages to complete a summoning ritual and appeal to Odin to restore his powers. Odin agrees, but only for a limited time, stating this as his last chance. Loki then kidnaps Alvey in exchange for the mask. When Tonya returns home, she goes with Tim and Otis, whom Tim had apologized to for his negligence towards him and convinced him that Alvey could be his new best friend, to make the exchange with Loki, but Loki decides to keep Alvey despite the exchange, forcing the group to chase after them as Tim becomes the Mask once more. The subsequent confrontation is relatively evenly matched due to both of them possessing equal powers, prompting Loki to halt the fight, and suggest that they should let Alvey decide who he wants to be with. Although Loki tries to lure Alvey to him with promises of fun, Tim takes the mask off and convinces his son to choose him using the connection he had forged with him.Saddened and enraged, Loki tries to kill Tim, but his time runs out and Odin appears in person, once again scolding Loki for his failure. Tim, however, feels sympathy for Loki and reminds Odin that regardless of their problems, they will still be family and nothing is more important than that. Touched by Tim's speech as the mask is returned, Odin reconciles with Loki and the duo return home. Some time later, Tim is rehired when his subsequent cartoon, based on his own experiences of Alvey and Otis competing for his attention, becomes a success. After the Avery family watches the cartoon's premiere, Tonya reveals that she is pregnant again.","When the Take-its steal this year's supply of Easter Eggs, an unlikely group of characters band together and brave the perils of taking back what is rightfully theirs.

Boundary pusher... Enfant terrible... Driven taskmaster...."" Much can be said about Chef Charlie Trotter, the self-proclaimed ""excellence-ist,"" who reimagined haute American cuisine and made Chicago the culinary capital it is today. Charlie was a rock star among the first generation of celebrity chefs, but because he rose to prominence in the pre-social media era, his legacy stands to be lost to time.
For 25 years, Charlie and his diverse team that hailed from all over Chicago and elsewhere improvised 10-course tasting menus, never serving the same dish twice. The self-taught chef was credited with inventing micro-greens and took vegetarianism mainstream, and the groundbreaking style of photography in his cookbooks made him the godfather of food porn. Charlie's obsession with exceptional ingredients and his exacting management style drew ambitious aspiring chefs to his door, and his flock of trainees have become the who's who of the culinary world.
To his employees, Chef Charlie Trotter was an enigmatic guru. To the media, he was a caricature of an overbearing perfectionist. But to those who loved him, he was ""Chuck,"" a fun-loving dreamer whose passion knew no bounds. LOVE, CHARLIE reveals how, over the course of his career, Chuck (his authentic self) gave way to Charlie (his professional persona), with devastating consequences.
Told through intimate sit-down interviews with family, friends and celebrated chefs including Wolfgang Puck,
Emeril Lagasse and Grant Achatz, along with extensive personal archival material (including 8mm home movies
and hundreds of pieces of personal correspondence), and evocative graphics and animation- the film is a searing portrait of what happens when a person's identity becomes intrinsically tied to their work and an epic cautionary tale of what can happen when that work fades away.","Charlie Trotter revolutionized American cuisine but his quest for excellence cost him everything. Featuring Grant Achatz, Emeril Lagasse, and Wolfgang Puck."

The former amateur golf champion is besieged by the malaise of encroaching older age, working as a bank executive, gearing up for retirement, deep concern for his wife's unanswered needs, his humanitarian daughter's survival, and a potentially lethal loss of faith. But, at his nadir, in his office one afternoon, a voice speaks to him via his computer monitor.
What does a syncopated voice--claiming to be God Almighty--have in mind for Joe?
This ostensible God has chosen Joe to deliver a message to the world; it's this: The seemingly impossible is possible. The God voice tells Joe he is going to play in the World Entire golf championship, and if he can renew his faith powerfully enough, he will win.
Well, first and foremost, God wants Joe to meet his guide, his Virgil. Except his Virgil is an incredibly quirky man named Herb. And he's a museum of tattoos and he drives a motorcycle and he makes golf clubs and promises Joe that he will help him regain the ability of his youth. If Joe will trust, not Herb, not God, but himself.
And so, Joe and Herb set out on a journey of contention, of doubt, of setbacks that through Joe's burgeoning faith in himself and the earthy wisdom of Herb turns his world upside down and then, in an act of outrageous selflessness, of stupefying generosity that turns his--and our--world very much right side up.
When Herb roars away in the last minute of our journey, he leaves standing like a fortress of love and faith the family Amable-Amo--Joe, Sheila, their daughter Audrey, and by extension, everyone they touch.","Sixty-five-year-old Joe Amable-Amo thinks nothing much in his background distinguishes him from other guys his age. He is struggling with his faith after tragedy hits. As the former amateur golfer's life continues to unfold, Joe is besieged with his marriage, working as a bank executive, and gearing up for retirement. But as he is about to discover, life has a way of throwing a curveball that changes everything. Joe is working at his desk when he receives a message from God on his computer screen that tells him he has been chosen to deliver an inspirational message to the world that the seemingly impossible is possible.

But they don't stop a turf war from erupting among Italian and Chinese organized crime syndicates. There's Manhattan mob boss Al Capella (Tony Darrow: Goodfellas), Brooklyn mob boss Amador Condimento (Vincent Pastore: The Sopranos), and Chinatown Triad boss Hung Phat (Lo Meng: Ip Man 2). They're all involved in the underbelly of the condiments trade. The illegal trafficking of oils, spices, and herbs has been around for centuries, begun by the great Italian explorer Marco Polo-and its very serious business for these crime families. Recently, they've been trying to move in on each other's turf and tensions are high. And when a Chinese guy starts poking around and tries to join the MOB, the double-crossing begins. Despite being Chinese, young ""Vinny"" Chow (Jay Kwon: The Punisher) embarks on a personal quest to join the Italian mob so he can get the Italian girl of his dreams, Tina Di Pocco, who only dates Wiseguys. In his many attempts to prove himself mob-worthy, Vinny is drawn into a web of intrigue instigated by New York's dirty crime commissioner Sean O'Greedy (Raymond J. Barry: The 100), who is playing all the mob bosses against one another. Along with his friends Joey Risotto and Lawrence, Vinny is recruited by special agents Johnson and Johnson to infiltrate the mob. He must impersonate The DON to gather evidence that could take down the entire New York Crime Syndicate once and for all. The title ""Made in Chinatown"" is a play on the phrase ""Made in China"" and the Italian Mafia's notion of being ""Made."" And so Vinny Chow literally is, ""Made in Chinatown.""","Goodfellas meets Ip Man when a young Chinese nobody sets out to become a Don in the Italian Mafia. It turns out that earning respect, finding love, and discovering his identity doesn't come so easy. He'll have to fight his way to the top."

What they all have in common, besides the fact Holly is never the bride, is her Great Aunt Lillian, who matched up each couple. Holly tells what she is looking for in a man, but the men shown with her don't seem ideal.In a small town, Holly works in her father's business, Castaway Fly Fishing. She hopes her brother Spencer will return and take over, since she has been running it since her father's death. She seems to enjoy it, but it's not really what she wants. The family has another business, the Holly Lane Christmas tree farm which is about to open for the season.Spencer is marrying Angela before Christmas, and an engagement party is being held. Although the leaves are still on the trees, many Christmas decorations are up. Spencer shows up with his college roommate Chris, who for some reason thinks he will not be welcome. A misbehaving boy drops a rose near the door to the house where the party is being held. Holly is standing nearby as Chris and Spencer walk in. In slow motion with elegant music, Chris hands Holly the rose.Cheryl and others think Holly needs a man. Holly walks outside where Chris is. He is uncomfortable with crowds and has a conversation with Holly which is not unpleasant, but he's not that nice and doesn't care to socialize. When both of them are back inside, Lillian is asked to pick another couple. She picks Holly and Chris. This makes them both uncomfortable.Back at home, Holly has an uncomfortable breakfast with her mother, Spencer and Chris.Angela tries on an old-fashioned wedding gown that Holly's mother wore but shows Holly what she wishes she could wear. Holly, who is planning the wedding, says that one is too expensive, and she persuades Angela to wear the one that they already have.At the Christmas tree farm, people are having a good time, buying trees and other merchandise, and having their pictures taken. Kids get their pictures taken with Santa Claus. Holly is hiding because she's embarrassed that everyone who went to that party knows Aunt Lillian put her together with Chris and will expect them to be a couple. Angela is helping out with the business and she gets Holly to come out of hiding and announces Holly will be her maid of honor. This makes Holly very happy until Spencer walks in and says Chris will be her best man.The wedding will take place at Cheryl's house so a visit takes place to plan exactly what will take place. Cheryl's book club, consisting primarily of older women, is meeting. The women persuade Chris to join them. He is uncomfortable. Eventually, Chris and Holly end up under the mistletoe and everyone says they have to kiss. Holly says it's all right. Just kiss her on the cheek. Chris angrily refuses to do anything.Back at home, Chris is helping Holly's mother with cooking. He's really good at that. Then there is an unpleasant meal where the family learns all about Chris. He is from Dallas but most recently lived in Chicago. His degree is in marketing and statistical analysis but he was recently fired from a great job. He will not spend Christmas with his family because they are not an ideal family like this one. In fact, he dislikes the holiday. Holly can't imagine anyone hating Christmas because she absolutely loves it.Spencer will not take over either of the family businesses. He plans to start a painting business. Holly was depending on money from the tree farm to pay for a trip to the Eastern United States.Back at the Christmas tree farm, Chris believes he can help improve the marketing of the business. He suggests changes to the web site, including better photos, but the photos others take aren't as good as they could be. Chris starts taking photos with his camera. He seems to be enjoying himself at last, and he has fun with the family. And he's really good at photography, but it's a career with too much uncertainty, so he won't listen to those who try to get him to do that as a career.The family decorates their own tree and invites Chris, looking serious at his laptop, to help. Once again, he seems happy.Later, Chris helps Holly with more decorations. His mother calls on his cell phone, and later texts, but he refuses to respond until Holly persuades him to at least make an effort. Chris finally agrees but tells Holly his family did not get along and his mother thinks Christmas with her family is a lot better than it really is.At the fishing business, Holly sees her ex and hides from him. Chris sees her and they talk about their relationships. Chris had a girlfriend but they broke up. Holly won't admit the other man was her boyfriend because they didn't date that many times and he didn't want to commit. Chris thinks it shouldn't take that long to figure out whether a man is worth having a relationship with.Chris and Holly eventually have a conversation where they learn more about each other. Holly loves Christmas because her father did. Holly had to quit college when her father died in a wreck that seriously injured her mother. Spencer was also in college but someone had to take care of their mother. Holly also had to run the fishing business and has been doing it ever since. It's not what she really wants, she says. Chris says Holly shouldn't do what other people want her to do. Chris says photography was his dream but he chose a major that would make him money and give him stability. As they make cookies together they have fun and end up getting flour and frosting all over each other.When Holly decides to take Chris' advice, her mother says maybe it's time to sell the fishing business and she knows someone who would like to buy it. Spencer isn't happy that other family members don't want him to do what he wants, and Holly thinks she will feel guilty if Spencer fails at what he wants to do because of her. Holly plans to go on her trip in the short term before deciding what she will do with her life. Some think she should plan weddings for a living.Chris gets a phone call. The company he was working for admits they were wrong to fire him and they want him back. Chris wants to return but wonders if he really should.The wedding is the next day and Holly has planned a surprise bachelorette party. But she has finally agreed to a formal date with Chris. She tries to do both at once. Wearing a sparkly and very short red dress, she and Angela go somewhere for what Angela believes will be an quiet dinner with just the two of them. It is anything but quiet as they walk into a room with the other bridesmaids who are quite loud and ready to party. There is plenty of drinking.Holly sneaks out and walks through the restaurant to another room where Chris is waiting for her. They think they are having a nice date but Holly keeps finding excuses to leave and Chris soon gets very frustrated. The girls don't seem to notice or care but Angela is miserable, and she finally tells Holly she did not want that party. Holly returns to Chris one last time, and when Chris learns the truth he leaves angrily. Outside, Holly hands him information about a photography job she found for him. She says it will let him fulfill his dream and give him more stability than a free-lance photographer would have. Chris is angry at Holly trying to run his life and do things for him when he doesn't want or need people to do things for him.Holly isn't through being made unhappy, as she has an unpleasant conversation with Angela, who says Holly tries to run other people's lives because she thinks she knows better than other people what is best for them. Angela says Holly is trying to plan the perfect wedding because it's the one Holly can't have, and it's not the ideal wedding for Angela. And Angela says she hates the dress. Holly ends up doing a lot of crying.The next day, the wedding is about to happen and Holly shows up at Angela's place with the expensive dress and says she gave up her trip to buy it. Angela is very happy. But when Holly visits Chris to give him the rings, he is cold to her and closes the door on her.So will the miracle happen between these two?","Romantic, small-town girl Holly and realist, career-driven Chris aren't a likely pair, but when ""matched"" together by Holly's all-knowing great-aunt, they don't have much of a choice."

Joe's lifelong dream of becoming a respected screenwriter seemed within reach. Joe was an outsider in ""LaLa Land,"" and Marco-Antonio moved fast, calling on all connections and getting the word out on the success of Joe's script in the film festival circuit. Meetings were set and ""off-the-record"" offers looked promising. Joe's struggles seemed to be a thing of the past... Now it was a waiting game, and Joe was champing at the bit. On an Uber fare which Joe often drove to make ends-meet, Joe meets a pair of independent film makers whom seemed to tell Joe what he already knew. ""Why sell when you can own"" is what they preached. This got Joe thinking...

A meeting was set with just Joe and the two filmmakers and Joe was ready to move. Without Marco-Antonio's savvy Hollywood sense, Joe soon found himself agreeing and signing a ""partnership"" contract which ultimately leads to zero ownership. When Joe realized his script was no longer his, he was devastated. The decades of endless writing sessions and sacrifice were gone. How would Joe break the catastrophic news to his family and his biggest supporter, his wife Elizabeth?

Every single problem we face in the western world is ultimately a theological problem, and every solution to each problem is a theological absolute. What happened to the living, powerful, transformative, nation-shaking Christianity that Jesus brought to our world? Something dressed up to look like Christianity is doing just fine here in America, but can it possibly be the real thing? It certainly resembles Christianity, but most of the people I know sense that something isn't right. Cashiers say that the best way to recognize a counterfeit dollar is not by studying counterfeit dollars, but by getting to know the real thing well enough that you can easily discern the fake. Maybe that's part of our problem today? Maybe members of this present generation who call themselves ""Christians"" really believe they are Christians, because they can't recognize the counterfeit? When we look at history, the western church we see right now hardly resembles what it once was. In the twentieth century, the twin evils of Communism and Fascism slaughtered nearly 200,000,000. Both forces are still attempting to co-opt Christianity to serve their goals. If this evil is still alive and active, why is it seldom addressed in most churches today? Could it be that this evil is compromising our churches from the inside out? What if these forces are twisting the doctrine that grew our great nation to suit its own purposes? This documentary will answer these questions and provide the theological solution necessary to stop the destruction of our beloved nation's foundation: The Church.—EWTC"

Ass Clowns opens with our lead character Froggie, 40's, searching for love in all the wrong places. Froggie is a larger than life individual with an open heart and no ill intentions. He's distraught at the loss of his one true love Candy. Candy, it seems, has asked for space to explore other relationships leaving Froggie wandering the streets in the search for love. We meet Froggie at his lowest point. One of utter despair. As Froggie wanders the streets of Los Angeles, Muta, a 40-something man child, follows in the shadows.What ensues is unbelievable even for Hollywood standards. Muta decides that he is going to teach Froggie the ways of the world and how to ""pick up chicks"". We learn that Muta has been ""mentoring"" men in the ways of picking up women. Froggie lets Muta know that Candy is his one true love but that he's open to what Muta has to offer. After all, he wants to make Candy jealous.The film follows the antics of Froggie and Muta as they go from one hysterical adventure to the next. In fact, every piece of advice that Muta gives Froggie lands Froggie in worse shape than he started.

Stewart Brand was part of some of the most significant moments of the 20th Century: he helped found the modern environmental movement, he launched a seminal publication that Steve Jobs called a bible of the hippie generation, and founded the first Hackers Conference. Using never-before-seen 16mm film, photographs, and personal diaries, We Are As Gods briefly examines some of Stewart's extraordinary biography and influence.Following Stewart on his current global expedition to find out how de-extinction technology can reverse climate change and to prevent the loss of species on a global scale, his journey begins in a place called Pleistocene Park. Here two eccentric Russian scientists have been living in self-imposed exile trying to resurrect the woolly mammoth and bring back other ancient mega-fauna to stave off climate catastrophe.When Stewart arrives, it's the hottest year on record in Siberia. As the frozen soil warms, it threatens to release an ocean of greenhouse gasses that could trigger catastrophic climate change, a feedback loop of warming that threatens life on earth as we know it. This is why Stewart and his Russian hosts hope to bring back the ancient animals that roamed here when the earth was colder, before humans arrived in the area and wiped them all out. When animals like the mammoth are brought back, they believe they will keep the soil colder by kicking up the top layer of ice on the ground, allowing the freezing Arctic air to penetrate below the surface and cool the permafrost an estimated 15 degrees, keeping the greenhouse gas inside.At Pleistocene Park, Stewart examines the permafrost in ice caves, illuminates the highly combustible methane being released from the earth by lighting a huge plume of gas on fire, and excavates woolly mammoth bones from the thawing soil. It's an Arctic adventure with a central mission: Stewart and his scientific colleagues hope they can find a sample with enough ancient DNA that they can recreate the genome of the mammoth. While this sounds like science fiction, according to a fellow member of the expedition and biotech pioneer George Church of Harvard University, it is not. Church is the lead of Stewart's Woolly Mammoth Revival Project, and he is confident that with enough DNA, re-engineering these ancient animals is possible. When the group finds a clump of 30,000-year-old mammoth hair, they have what they need. George and Stewart package it carefully and to bring back to the lab at Harvard.Stewart's mission is not just about bringing back extinct animals. He's also hoping to expand the toolkit for the conservation of endangered and threatened species. DeExtinction may sound like a magic fix, but many environmentalists ridicule the idea. They say it is fraught with unintended consequences, and dismiss Stewart himself as misguided. This derision from his peers is a dramatic turn for Stewart, who was once at the vanguard of the environmental movement. In archival footage, we learn about Stewart's role in the 1970s counterculture, galvanizing a generation to live in a more sustainable way. Looking back on these days now, Stewart thinks he was wrong about much of what he started. He thinks the environmental movement is too fixated on what is ""natural,"" and that humans need to use all the futuristic tools at their disposal to confront problems like mass extinction and climate change. Today, his heretical ideas have made him an outsider among his former friends.Stewart has staked his reputation on this belief that humans must learn to change, adapt, and develop technology for the future of the planet. Though he has changed his mind over the years about methodology, he is in many ways remarkably consistent. He is a futurist who encourages humans to take the long view as we contemplate our impact on the earth.The ""Clock of the Long Now"" project illustrate Stewart's enduring legacy and ability to create grand philosophical projects to shift our collective perspective on space, time, and ecology. For decades, Stewart has been dreaming of building a giant clock, bigger than the statue of liberty, that will last for 10,000 years come nuclear holocaust or climate catastrophe, keeping perfect time long after he and all of us are gone, reminding humans to look beyond their own lifespans at something larger than us all. December 2019, Stewart and his collaborators finished the clock and installed it in the core of the highest mountain peak in Texas.","""We are as gods and might as well get good at it,"" Stewart Brand wrote in '68. The pioneer of LSD, cyberspace, futurism, and modern environmentalism now urges people to use our god-like powers to fight extinction by reviving lost species."

The concert was performed in front of a select group of fans in Chance's hometown of Chicago, and it was intentionally staged and filmed as a movie to be screened in theaters. Conceived and written by Chance and directed with cinematic style and a smooth, flowing rhythm by Jake Schreier, ""Magnificent Coloring World"" is not a filmed concert but a mapped-out, intricately planned concert film, and the difference is striking. The film transports viewers into the front row of a Chance the Rapper concert. Amidst a monumental arena tour, Chance invited a select group of his biggest Chicago-area fans to an undisclosed event. Fans showed up to a meeting spot and were brought by school bus to Cinespace Chicago Film Studios, where they were surprised to enter a secret Chance the Rapper concert. Over the course of an hour, Chance ripped through his hit catalog, performing songs from Coloring Book on a unique multi-stage backdrop designed by Chance himself. This is not the typical documentation of a concert, which is then later packaged to be a concert movie. Instead, Chance knew ahead of time that he wanted to create a special cinematic experience. He arranged the space with six multi-color sound stages, nine cameras, and intricately placed microphones to capture the audience and show in a unique way. With a run time of just 61 minutes, Magnificent Coloring World captures the energy in the room that day, bringing Chance the Rapper's larger-than-life persona to the big screen.","Chance the Rapper performs, transcending his craft into a message; one message of love."

He is also a composer, an author, and film director. As a black man, Parks believes he has to be more productive and talented than his white counterparts because if ever pitted against them, he must prove to be too valuable to ever consider being terminated.
Devin Allen is a photographer who takes pictures of the Black Lives Matter protests and riots in Baltimore. He recalls going to Barnes and Noble and seeing the work of Gordon Parks illustrating gang life in Harlem. Allen realized how powerful a picture was in telling a story. Allen's career took off in 2015 when Freddie Gray was killed by police. At the uprising at Camden Yards, Allen snapped a photo which became the cover of TIME magazine which jump started his career.
Gordon Parks said he might have chosen the gun or knife as his weapon, but it was the camera where he could express his view of the injustice of racism and the downtrodden in America. Parks grew up in the quintessential black experience of the time in the South. In Kansas, he was proximate to lynching and racial terrorism. He discovered he had to be two people: one personality around white folks and another side he only shared with his family. When at least four friends of Gordon's were killed, Gordon's mother felt Kansas was no longer a safe place Gordon got a job as a waiter in the dining car of a train and started to tour the country. It was hardly glamorous, with Gordon often experiencing poverty, drunks, and addiction in the places he was able to stay.
Gordon learned photographer from training manuals. His studio was the kitchen of his home and his lights were made from tin cans. Parks took an interest in photographing the value, interest, and art in the lives of ordinary black people and was to sell these images to the newspapers. In 1942, Parks receives a fellowship to be the photographer for the Farm Security Administration in Washington, D.C. The FSA was resetting people who had lost their farms in the Dustbowl. They hired photographers and film makers to document what they were doing. Parks was mentored by Roy Stryker who was in charge of the documentation effort. During this time, Parks did a series of photos of a colored cleaning woman named Ellen Watson who worked at their offices. His work seemed to say that here was a person who was giving her all for a country that did not recognize her as a complete person. Parks continued to work with Watson photographing her in her home and community. A famous photo shows four generations of her family within the context of a very small room on her apartment in a very sophisticated way.
Latoya Ruby Frazier is inspired by Parks to attempt to change that which she does not approve of in the world by exposing it with the lens of the camera. In 2016, Frazier is commissioned by Elle magazine to document the Flint Water crisis. It was during this time, Frazier met Shea Cobb and her daughter Zion. Shea was at the point of making the decision to either stay in Flint or return to where her father lived in Mississippi where he said the water would not kill them. Her photo essay continued four years later in Mississippi continuing the story of the Flint family. Gordon taught Frazier to be present, talk with, and empathize with her subjects. Frazier also claimed she was interested in the collaborations Parks did with Ralph Ellison in the early 1940's. Parks and Ellison did two such collaborations, one about the psychiatric needs in Harlem and another depicting scenes from Ellison's novel, ""The Invisible Man"". Taking some of these photographs as a portfolio, Parks approached LIFE magazine who paid him $500 for a story on a Harlem gang leader.
Starting from a broad approach, Parks contacted local police to find such a gang leader. The police knew several but did not believe Parks would be allowed to photograph them. In one such precinct, Gordon met Red Jackson, a notorious street gang leader. He spent an extended time with Red. Eventually, he photographed Red in his everyday life with his family. He also photographed his gang and fights they would have. At one point, Parks photographed one of Red's gang who was killed and Red's vow of revenge.
Jamel Shabazz photographs kids in Brooklyn. Shabazz grew up as a victim to the streets until he found the weapon of the 35 mm camera. Shabazz worked in the department of corrections for 20 years. When he was placed at Rikers Island, he thought of it as his new assignment. With crack proliferation on the street, he able to photograph the results of the epidemic, the brutality inside the prison, and lack of rehabilitation. Once back on the streets, Shabazz would meet young people and seek to build them up telling them he saw greatness in them that he wanted to photograph. He did not want them to end up in a place like Rikers Island.
With the success of the Harlem Gang Leader project, LIFE magazine hired Gordon Parks as its first African American photographer. By the mid 1950's Parks was well established in the industry. In 1956, Gordon is sent to Alabama to capture images of segregated life in the Jim Crow south. Just months before, Emmett Till was lynched and murdered in an act of racial hatred in Mississippi. Jet magazine published the photos of Till's ravaged body and drew attention to the persecution of blacks in the South. In his pictorial, Parks used color photography to show in stark terms the different lives of blacks and whites in Alabama. He focused on segregated entrances and facilities for blacks and whites, expressing the longing, discomfort and distraction it caused the African Americans of that day.
Ava DuVernay, the director of Selma, learned about the intimacy that Gordon created between the camera and the subject that brought the audience in. DuVernay says that actors have the same goal, to draw an audience into the way the actor is being and feeling in the moments portrayed.
The breadth of Gordon Parks work is far broader than the social justice movement. Parks did everything from photojournalism to portraits to abstraction to fashion. The juxtaposition of his work can be fascinating. One subject was Gloria Vanderbilt, among the wealthiest women of her time. Vanderbilt said Gordon was the first African American person she ever became friends with. Despite the different upbringing, they connected as artists as Vanderbilt was a playactor and also a fashion designer.
Parks, as a photographer gained respect to move in other's spaces without interfering with what was going on. In 1957, Parks was assigned to do an expose on the crime crisis in America. He presented crime as an ambiguity. He also showed the humanity around crime. There were also photos of police that portrayed how blacks in the north perceived police as menacing and imposing of law and order.
Bryan Stevenson uses Park's work in The Legacy Museum in Montgomery, Alabama, to create a narrative in their effort to change hearts and minds to eliminate prejudice and racial injustice. The black experience illustrated in LIFE magazine was often set against the magazine's advertising which showed white happy carefree Americans. The contrast was eye opening to the magazine's readers.
In 1963, Gordon Parks was sent as the uniquely qualified black photographer on the staff of LIFE magazine to photograph the Nation of Islam. Malcolm X was Parks' initial contact on the story. Together, they had to seek the permission of Elijah Muhammad to continue. The Muslim leader was skeptical of someone working for ""the white devils"". Parks spent several months on the assignment and got unprecedented access to the religion. He was impressed with the conformity and order of the mosques. Gordon saw them training German Shepherd guard dogs. He met families who would renounce their children over their religion. Malcolm X requested the Parks fly out to Los Angeles when Ronald Stokes was killed in a police shooting. Parks put himself in the line of fire to stay close to the Nation of Islam leadership. From this he earned the respect of Malcolm X who referred to him as ""brother"". The story in LIFE was written in a rather inflammatory way. Parks had his own text in the coverage where he became an activist by pointing out the range of concerns of the brotherhood are broader to the entire black community in America.
Spike Lee used photographs taken during this period when he recreated the eulogy delivered for Malcolm X. Lee understood from Parks, the need to establish trust with a subject. When Lee films a documentary, he is required to ask subjects to open up about very painful incidents in their lives. One such film was ""4 Little Girls"" which discusses the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist church in Birmingham.
Parks' work documents many of the well-known personalities prominent in the Civil Rights Movement in the second half of the 20th Century when blacks left their complacency and demanded justice. Parks, however, was reluctant to take on the Muhammed Ali story. At the time, Ali had converted to Muslim, opposed the Vietnam War, and was riled by the press. Parks began to understand that Ali's art was simply his hands and his attitude. In the photos of Ali, Devin Allen learned that clarity is not always the goal of the photo. In a blur, emotion can be expressed. Allen has focused on sports in Baltimore in recent times. Following Parks lead, Allen has imbedded himself in Coach Calvin's boxing gym and has been able to capture the humanity of Calvin and the kids he trains to box.
Merv Griffin interviewed Gordon Parks after he introduced the world to Flavio, an impoverished boy from Brazil that put a face on the problem of poverty in Latin America. The photos inspired donations that brought Flavio to America and saved his life from his asthmatic condition. By 1969, Gordon Parks had achieved a celebrity status which somewhat compromised his ability to be just a somewhat anonymous black man taking pictures with his camera. Parks, however, was able to speak the language of celebrity on a series of talk shows he appeared on advocating for the causes he supported.
Parks moved on to film, which he saw as an even more powerful media to reach even greater numbers of people. He directed a movie drawn from his novel, ""The Learning Tree"", which portrayed some elements of his life growing up as a young Negro in Kansas. It was the first major studio movie directed by an African American. He followed this effort up with Shaft, working with Isaac Hayes to conceptualize the familiar theme song. Shaft, in many ways, personified the Black Power movement that was going on in that era. John Shaft was a man who moved freely among the boroughs of New York, from the radicals, to the gangsters to the police, just as Parks did during his career. Richard Roundtree, who played John Shaft, even realized his wardrobe for the character was Gordon Parks' selections supplied by his tailor.
Parks directing career, however, was short lived. Blaxploitation movies created revenue but had repetitive plots that eventually lost their audience. Parks was never considered for another type of movie by Hollywood producers. He blamed the color of his skin. Parks never achieved the greatness or the messaging in film as he had hoped. In later life, Parks had hoped to compose more and write more, but realized he was running out of time. He never stopped working.
In 1998, XXL magazine wanted to recreate ""A Great Day in Harlem"" photo which featured jazz artists some 40 years early. In 1998, the photo would feature some of the greatest artist in hip hop with many rappers present. After much convincing, Parks finally agreed to be the photographer which legitimized the hip hop genre.
Parks left a timeless collection of images which serve as models and inspiration for today's modern black photographers. They feel inspired to use the camera as a powerful weapon to create narratives, change perceptions, capture the critical moments in the social justice movement, and change the world.","Follows Gordon Parks' stellar career from staff photographer for LIFE magazine, through his artistic development photographing everyday Americans, through his evolution as a novelist and groundbreaking filmmaker."

Ilé is caught and, to raise money to get their friend out of jail, the others flee to Switzerland to grow six football fields worth of marijuana.Having just enough money for one planting season, the heroes rent an old Swiss farm. Their adventures take them across Europe: to a music festival in Germany, a medical marijuana clinic in London and the coffee shops of Amsterdam. And all the while, the Green Goddess - the divine feminine spirit that lives within the THC crystal - watches over them, choosing one lucky individual to meet her.The Green Goddess creators, with a total base crew of eight and the actors, really did spend a full season in the Swiss Alps growing six football fields of marijuana while filming the feature length movie. Forging ahead through challenges as diverse as enlisting the Swiss fire department to pump water over the fields to simulate a thunderstorm, or wrestling with a farm crane in lieu of a film crane for sweeping shots of the fields, to eventual run-ins with the Swiss authorities during a time of changing growing laws, the team returned to the US with a mostly finished film. Now, more than a decade later, the film is now released, and has grown to over 300 people in the cast and crew.The film is far from preachy, however, and will take audiences on a new kind of adventure - a quest to find the enigmatic Green Goddess herself. And it must be mentioned - there is A LOT of ganja in this film, and 500 psychedelic animated sequences making The Green Goddess movie one of the most animated independent feature films of all time!Please visit the website www.GreenGoddessMovie.com","Psychedelic international marijuana cult classic: 3 Americans grow fields of cannabis in Switzerland and meet the divine feminine spirit that lives within the THC crystal.

Against the backdrop of criminal fraud accusations and a federal trial against Holmes -- once the world's youngest self-made female billionaire and CEO of her biotech company Theranos -- Valley of Hype explores the influence that Silicon Valley's startup culture played in Theranos' ascent and collapse. The film considers how the region's ethos, which sometimes values a perfect pitch over proven results, could be raised in her defense. The film, narrated by legal reporter Alexis Keenan, introduces individuals close to Theranos who question whether Holmes is to some extent a victim, rather than a villain, of the Silicon Valley culture that supported her ascent. The former Silicon Valley darling, Holmes, now faces up to 20 years in prison over the Justice Department's charges that she used Theranos, her once-hyped blood testing company, to defraud investors. The Yahoo Finance documentary features exclusive interviews with people tied to Theranos who have never spoken out before, including board member, Dan Warmenhoven, and bio-engineer, Jocelyn Bailey. The film also features experts on Silicon Valley's evolution as a tech and investment hub who question the diligence of other interested parties who went along for the company's once valued $9 billion ride. ""Valley of Hype questions the diligence of financial, political, and academic heavyweights who surrounded Elizabeth Holmes and helped her build Theranos,"" Keenan said.

RENEE (mid-50s, widowed, liberal & progressive, a serious but caring mom) lives with two of her three children: JOE (22, a cool-dude aspiring DJ) and VASHY (16, bubbly, wishes she were older). Grandmother GRAN-HATTIE (70s, cute-cranky but wise) also lives with them. Next door live DOC (50s, patriarchal, conservative successful dentist) and his wife AUNTIE DEE (ditzy, traditional housewife) and their two children: LISSA (20, a romantic, in local all-girls college but secretly wants to transfer) and MATTHEW (18, high school nerd, secretly a Buddhist).But the star of the family is MAYA (24, brilliant & beautiful, a law-student in Boston, a hard-core progressive like her mom)... and all the Graysons are excited that she's coming home to visit for Christmas. Moreover, Maya is bringing her new boyfriend named ""Trent"". As Maya calls her mom from the Boston airport en route, Renee & Joe & Vashy excitedly speculate on who this undoubtedly stellar ""brother"" is. Maya's excited to bring Trent home to meet everybody, too... but the one fact she leaves out (because why should it matter, anyway?) is that Trent, is, well, white.As Maya travels home with TRENT (25, blue-collar and course but energetic and big-hearted - and totally in love with Maya), she describes her complicated extended family... and we see that he's actually been taking careful notes on them all, because he's very keen on making a good impression. But when Maya & Trent arrive home, it's surprises all-round: the Graysons are surprised - and frankly disappointed - that progressive Maya is dating a white guy (Renee the most concerned)... while both Maya & Trent are surprised - and frankly disappointed - that her ""progressive"" family would even care.While Trent unpacks over at Doc & Dee's house (he'll bunk with Maya's cousin Matthew), we reveal why Trent is extra-keen on winning over the Graysons: he's secretly planning on proposing to Maya on Christmas Day. Realizing their work is cut out for them, Maya & Trent hatch a plan to win over the family members, one-by-one, working their way up to the biggest challenge: Maya's mom Renee.Their first ""target"" is Auntie Dee. Trent wins her over by relieving her of her cooking duties, and preparing a terrific meal for that evening. (He also discovers Dee's secret proclivity for sports gambling...). At dinner that night, Trent does his best to likewise charm Doc and Renee, with limited results - especially when he unwittingly tips off that Maya has accepted a job after law school at a stuffy Boston law firm. Renee leaves the dinner hurt and angry that daughter Maya seems to be abandoning her activist ways for corporate law. But the night is not a complete failure: Trent discovers that Maya's cousin Matthew has secretly converted to Buddhism - which Trent salutes and promises to keep secret, much to a grateful Matthew's considerable relief.The next day, Christmas Eve, Maya and Renee argue about what Renee perceives as Maya's shifting - even devolving - values... and about Renee's assessment that Trent, a ""symptom,"" can't really love or appreciate Maya as a black woman, because he just doesn't ""get it."" Hurt that her mother would so insult the man she loves (and her judgment), Maya storms off. As Maya & Trent commiserate while dropping off food for a local charity drive, Trent worries he'll never be good enough for Renee... while Maya tries to explain Renee's expectations for her, especially in light of the sacrifices Renee was forced to make to her own activism (needing to take a job as a CPA) following the death of Maya's father/Renee's husband three years before. His optimism returning, Trent tries to assure Maya that all will be well... because his charm-offensive will double when her family sees his athletic prowess in today's tradition neighborhood Christmas Eve touch football game.In a field behind a neighbor's house, the Grayson cousins plus Trent plus a few neighbors gather for the game. Unfortunately, Trent's grand plan to impress everyone seems decidedly thwarted when it's revealed that Maya's ex-boyfriend ERIC shows up (invited by Joe). A Rhodes scholar and part-time model, Eric is stunningly handsome (if someone conceited), charming, African-American, a superb athlete... and ultra-competitive. Many is surprised and disappointed, while Trent is irked and intimidated. However, Trent quickly devises a different tactic for ""winning"" - by choosing the least athletic folks for his team ... and making sure his teammates are fully involved and have a blast, even while they lose the game miserably. This tactic works, winning over Maya's cousin Lissa. But Eric, jealous of Trent's joyful inclusiveness, angry flattens Trent, breaking his phone, drawing blood and knocking out one of Trent's fillings.At Doc's dental office, Doc fixes Trent's broken tooth (as Trent struggles to elicit Doc's blessing while comedically slurring his words under the influence of novocaine). In the waiting room, Maya confesses to her mom Renee that she's in love with Trent, big-time... which further worries Renee that Maya is making a big mistake.That night, Joe & Matthew & Lissa take Trent & Maya sneak into their local high school (to give Trent a better sense of Maya's childhood, per his request). Vashy wants to come, but Maya forbids her, not wanting Vashy to get into trouble - an exclusion which angers Vashy. In the empty gym, Joe plays some of his music tracks and shows off his DJing skills, while Maya tries to woo back Trent, who is still upset by Eric's appearance and brutishness. Joe, himself growing suspicious of Trent's character, challenges him ... but Trent wins him over with a plain but wholly sincere profession of love for his sister Maya. While Maya & Trent dance in the empty gym, Lissa guesses that Trent is in fact really in town to propose! While Trent & Maya feel good that they've now won over everyone except Vashy & Gran-Hattie & Renee, Trent's sense of unworthiness and of Maya's stature magnifies when, as they all exit, they pass the ""Maya Grayson Student Government Center"" - named after the school's most promising graduate. Yikes. Meanwhile, Renee, pushing back on insinuations from a neighbor/friend and from brother-in-law Doc that her resistance stems, at least partly, from her own subtle racism, determines she better do something - something bold - in order to break up the romance.Christmas Day starts with presents and good feelings... but Vashy turns the tides by showing an old home movie of young Maya (made when she was ten), playing Santa - and insisting that all white people belong on the naughty list. This revelation of the depths & length of Maya's passionate (if childish) activism renews Trent's insecurities, and he painfully confronts Maya, wondering why she's with him in the first place. She tries to explain what it really means to be a black person in America - even in the 21st century - while reaffirming her love and her belief in him & his big-hearted wonderful character. He says he liked it before, when he was ""colorblind"" to the issues of race... and we worry for the couple's future.While everyone gets ready for Christmas dinner, Renee finds Trent's notebook, accidentally left on a couch - and discovers all the notes & (secret) details he's been writing about each one of them.Right before Christmas dinner, Trent chats with Gran-Hattie, who gives him her blessing. And overhearing Maya push back hard on Renee's criticism of them, and hearing Maya's confession of devotion to him, Trent feels ready to propose... even if they've only won over six-out-of-eight Graysons. But even as he starts to give his Christmas toast, which we know will lead to his proposal, Renee interrupts him - and passes out of each of the family members the pages from Trent's notebook. Secrets are revealed, and character traits come across as insulting in Trent's short-hand. Immediately the family members turn on Trent, fuming. As Maya watches helplessly in tears, he tries to explain - but they're done with him. Trent leaves, heartbroken. Maya chases him to the street, begging him to return and work things out ... but he fears their romance is doomed, now that her family so hates him.While Trent sulks at the airport overnight, preparing to fly home early, Maya quietly unleashes on her mom, rightly blaming her. The next morning, the other family members all argue with one another, since their secrets are uncomfortably revealed and they blame one another. Maya interrupts them and says good-bye, sadly but strongly, having chosen salvaging (if possible) her relationship with Trent over seeking her family's approval. Then Gran-Hattie chides them all, insisting that Trent took those notes only to try to win them over, so he could marry Maya - and they should all be ashamed. Ashamed they are, and quickly apologetic... but no one more so than Renee, who regrets terribly her actions and begs Maya's forgiveness.In a desperate attempt to find Trent (whose phone is broken) and now win him over, the Graysons take to ""black twitter"" ... and locate him at the airport just as he's about to depart. He's dubious and wary, but they're convincing. And with their enthusiastic encouragement, Trent does propose to Maya, who joyfully accepts - and Trent is welcomed wholeheartedly into the family.",Activist liberal progressive law student Maya brings her new boyfriend home for the holidays-- neglecting to tell her family that he's - well - white.

Another way is to use people's memories by passing down stories about personal experiences to the next generation. Memorabilia is one form used by so many TV shows and movies to constantly remind the public of their products' value over generations hoping that fans will pass their love of a certain entertainment entity down to younger generations.
Throughout the United States, The Andy Griffith Show (TAGS) and characters like
Andy and Opie Taylor, Aunt Bea, Floyd the Barber, Otis Campbell, Ernest T. Bass, Thelma Lou, and of course Barney Fife, continue to set off a certain nostalgic feeling of when life was simpler. Loyal audiences and superfans make it their life's mission to pass down that nostalgic Mayberry feeling to future generations; but who are some of these people and why do they do it? What happens when a television show from the 1960s still affects audiences decades later?
The Mayberry Effect is a thought provoking, humorous and inspiring feature length documentary investigating the topic of nostalgia through the lens of The Andy Griffith Show. The Mayberry Effect follows The Mayberry Deputy, David Browning, who is the nation's number one Barney Fife tribute artist, Allan Newsome, the Floyd The Barber tribute artist, Kenneth Junkin, the Otis Campbell tribute artist, and many other tribute artists as they entertain crowds all over the nation at various Mayberry festivals helping new and old Andy Griffith Show audiences laugh and stay connected to one of America's favorite television sitcoms of all time.
This 90 minute documentary asks the questions; did a simpler time actually exist, how did TAGS influence Mt. Airy, (Andy Griffith's hometown) and our American culture and will future generations continue to enjoy the sitcom?
The Mayberry Effect explores how fans today continue to celebrate the sitcom through festivals like Mayberry Days and Mayberry In The Midwest, decorating their own homes and businesses in all things Mayberry, through participating in Bible studies based on the lessons taught in the show and by dressing up as their favorite characters.
The Andy Griffith Show has never been off the air since its last season in 1968. Will people continue to flock to Andy Griffith's hometown of Mt. Airy, North Carolina to experience that Mayberry feeling or will the sitcom fade away into the past like so many other television shows have done over the past 60 years? The real question is... how long will The Mayberry Effect last?","Since 1960, The Andy Griffith Show's popularity has created fans of all ages, helped transition Mt. Airy, NC into a Mayberry Mecca, and has influenced many to become tribute artists of their favorite Mayberrian characters."

People can be seen talking and walking around through the windows as a man stalks up to the house, in his POV we watch as two fraternity brothers; Collin Williams (Micheal George) and Jared Hankler (Cohen Burton) are spied on by the man through the window, the man loses interest and spies around back, to where he goes under the back porch which has a secret entrance to the house. While Jared is typing up an essay on his computer, he hears the door to the bedroom open, he gets up and moves toward the door, asking who's there. Suddenly, from a side storage room, a man wraps a black garbage bag around his head and pulls him aside. Meanwhile upstairs, Collin and Michael Cunningham (Jackson Bigley) receive a present left at the front door, apparently signed by someone named ""Lenz"". Another character; Karter Fitzgerald (Cohen Burton) walks in and all three of them open the present, inside is a glass Christmas tree statue, which they place in the living room. Suddenly, Collin's phone rings, it's from an unknown caller that he picks up, the man on the other end begins to make weird and unsettling noises before beginning to speak, asking the men to ""please make it stop"" before beginning to go back to saying random nonsense with the name ""Billy"" clearly audible as Michael tells the caller to ""Shove his tongue in an electrical socket"". The caller hangs up and Michael gives Collins phone back, while Karter thinks it's a robo-call, Michael believes it's just a prank call made by another fraternity, while Collin is much more shook about it. After that, all the boys decide to go to bed, Michael sleeps in an upstairs bedroom while Collin and Karter will sleep in the main bedroom downstairs, where Jared was. They enter the downstairs bedroom and notice that Jared is gone, his laptop still open, they suspect he's just in the bathroom or outside on the phone and they go to bed, not hearing the singing coming from the garage, where Jared's dead, lifeless corpse is, having been suffocated by the garbage bag. The next day, on Christmas eve, most of the fraternity brothers have left for the holidays, leaving Collin, Karter, Michael and The Fraternity House's operator; Mr Thornton (Cohen Burton) who visits Collin in his room while he's on the phone with his father. Mr Thornton asks Collin if he's seen Jared anywhere, Collin says no as he gets another call from his phone. Collin picks up and the man on the other end identifies himself as Jack Hankler (Jackson Bigley), the older brother of Jared, who's been waiting for him at the train station. Both Collin and Jack plan to go to the police and file a missing persons report, they do so and the meet the Sheriff of the town, Sheriff Grady Baker (Cohen Burton), who tells them there's been another missing persons report, a 7 year old boy named Jimmy Addams (Alec Bigley) went missing two days before Jared. Grady puts the report in and tells the boys that there will be a search party later that day to look for both of them, which Collin, Karter and Michael attend, but not before getting another phone call, afterwards, Michael calls the police and Grady shows up and puts a tracker on the phone, telling Michael that they'll be able to track whoever made the calls. Back at the search party, Michael finds a dead body, the one of Jimmy Addams, who's been attacked and murdered by a hatchet. Michael calls over Grady and Grady puts the fraternity house in lock-down, since the body was found in the backyard forest. Back at the Fraternity house, Mr Thornton gets a phone call from Michael, telling him that he's gonna stay behind at the search party and look for Jared and that Karter and Collin are going back home. After the call, Mr Thornton goes to take a smoke in the garage, to where he finds Jared's body and is attacked by the intruder, who hacks Mr Thornton in the head with a hatchet and drags him back into the garage, slamming the door behind him. Upstairs, Karter and Collin arrive as Karter goes to take a shower and Collin goes into the main bedroom downstairs, and sees Grady down there, who has just arrived with another police cruiser, Collin asks why there's two cruisers outside and Grady tells him it's to patrol the fraternity house, Grady leaves as Collin goes upstairs and goes upstairs and takes a seat on the sofa. Outside in the police cruiser, Officer Don Hutchinson (Michael George) makes plans to go late Christmas shopping after his patrol, suddenly a snowball hits his car, he gets out and grabs a flashlight and looks around, as more snowballs are thrown at him, before he looks over at Jack's car, and the intruder throws one more snowball, before Hutchinson moves toward him as the man grabs Hutchinson and drags him away by the throat. Back inside Karter finishes his shower and talks to Collin, who says he's worried about Michael and Jared, scared that Jared had the same fate as Jimmy. Downstairs, Don stumbles inside, his wrists having been slit by a Chef's Knife. The intruder follows behind him and grabs his throat before slitting it with the chef's knife, before dropping the knife and starting to hide the body. Suddenly downstairs, Karter's phone begins to ring, they both go downstairs and Karter picks it up, the man on the other end begins to scream the name ""Billy"" and Karter hangs up, freaked out. Karter goes to take a nap on Jared's bed while Collin goes upstairs to wait for Michael. While he waits, in the background we see the intruder grab the glass Christmas tree statue and enter the bedroom. We watch as the intruder looms over Karter's bed and stabs Karter in the chest over and over with the statue. Back at the search party, Michael gets in his car and leaves to go to the fraternity house to where he is called by the man, to where Michael flips out on him and the caller hangs up. Michael returns to the house and talks with Collin, before telling Collin he should get some sleep before going downstairs to check on Karter, to where the door shuts behind him and the man wraps a garbage bag around Michael's head, before throwing him against the door and stabbing him through the bag and into his eye with the chef's knife, Killing him. At the police station, Grady calls Deputy Arex (Jackson Bigley) and tells him that the calls that the people have been getting are coming from a rotary phone and Jared's cell, Arex immediately makes his way to the fraternity house and calls Collin and informs him that the calls are coming from inside the house, Collin insists he gets his friends but from behind, Arex's gun is used against him and he is shot in the head as Collin flees downstairs, the killer in hot pursuit, with a garbage bag over his head as he runs into the bathroom and hides as Collin runs into the main bedroom, where Michael and Karter's Bodies lay, dead. Collin crawls away and looks up and sees the killer's eye looking at him, as he begins today ""Don't Tell Them What We Did Agnes"" revealing that the man who's been making the calls is the killer, as he rushes out and attacks Collin, who pulls off his garbage bag as the man begins to strangle him, Collin kicks The man away and hides in the basement, and locks the door behind him. Collin turns around and sees the bodies of Jared, Mr Thornton and Don. Collin arms himself with a fire poker and uses his weight to barricade the door, while accidentally opening the garage doors as Jack walks in, dressed in the same blue sweatshirt and denim jeans that the intruder was wearing. When Grady arrives he sees Jack, dead, with a fire poker through his heart and out the back, having been killed by Collin in self defense and Collin is knocked out. Collin tells Grady what happened before going unconscious again, only to be woken up in the same bed that Karter died in, by his father (Jackson Bigley) ,who tells him that he is a fighter. Grady enters the room and kindly asks his father to leave, which he does. Grady begins to ask Collin some questions. It's obvious that Collin doesn't remember much but he does remember that the man who attacked him , who he believes was Jack, said something about a little girl named Agnes. Troubled, Grady leaves the room and wishes Collin a Merry Christmas, and walks by the garage door, which is open just ajar to see a figure sitting in a chair, Before leaving the house. In the garage is Collin's dad's dead body, with a bag over his head and an arrow though his skull. As Grady leaves the house in his car and Collin begins to fall asleep, the lights to the house go off, and in the distance we begin to hear the soft noise, of a rotary phone, beginning to ring.","A Mysterious Intruder Breaks into a Fraternity House and begins to stalk and murder the occupants one by one, as the victims try to figure out who is behind the killings before they all become victims to the intruder."

Friends Morgan, Maddy, and Jason have big plans to mingle and flirt with their foreign counterparts. Morgan harbors a secret crush on a beautiful, knockout blond named Yvette, but still has deep feelings for his good friend, Maddy, a piano player in the band. Unfortunately, their bus breaks down and they're forced to stay at a nearby motel for the night.A trio of girls, including Yvette, tease the boys by inviting them to an ""orgy"" in their room. Morgan and Jason are determined to go without really knowing anything about orgies. Mr.T confides in Morgan that he's set booby traps, paper door stops, to check if any kids sneak out of their rooms and asks for Morgan's help in enforcing the rules. But Jason and Morgan sneak out anyway and bump into Maddy who wants to come along despite the boys' protestations. The group decides to play ""truth or dare"", which gets steadily more sexual at the encouragement of Yvette's boyfriend, Wings. Maddy is able to cut through some of the tension with her silliness and volunteers to take the fall for the group by replacing all of their door booby traps except hers. Mr. T notices that Maddy left her room but let her off because she's such a responsible kid and her reason for leaving to get ice was not questioned.The following day, MR.T takes the group to a historical site while they wait for the bus to be repaired. But, despite Morgan and Mr. T's best efforts, the trip is a boring bust. At the behest of their classmates, Maddy convinces the female TOUR GUIDE to ask Mr. T out so if they're stranded for another night, they'll have the night to themselves. To everyone's amazement, the plan works, and everyone tells Morgan that he should be dating a great girl like Maddy.Morgan and Maddy wander off alone and talk about stargazing, a favorite pastime of Maddy's. The talk turns to Morgan and Jason's secret handshake, which Morgan confesses is from their favorite childhood show, ""The Intergalactic Friendship Alliance."" He explains that as kids, he and Jason would always go searching for the Friendship Pearl, a sign that Earth was worthy enough to join the Alliance. Maddy asks if he would like to look for the Friendship Pearl later that night with her telescope, and Morgan agrees.Meanwhile, Mr.T frantically attempts to get the band to their competition but becomes disheartened when they miss most of the events and decides to give up. He encourages the kids to ""practice not giving a shit."" Much to their disillusionment.That night, Morgan and Yvette end up at the hot tub together, where Yvette confesses her frustrations with Wings and their relationship. Maddy comes to find Morgan to go stargazing but he chooses to attend a ""sexier"" version of the night's previous party at Wing's behest, as Yvette seems to want his company. Much to Morgan's chagrin, Maddy joins as well. The party quickly devolves into hormone-fueled antics. Wings makes out with one of their classmates, Rebecca, despite Yvette's obvious displeasure. Morgan and Maddy partially undress in front of one another and, uncomfortable with the situation, Morgan kisses Yvette. Upset, Maddy leaves the party. Wings and Rebecca leave for the bathroom to continue their hookup, and Morgan tries to sleep with Yevette, but thinking of Maddy, he can't do it. Morgan confesses that he's a virgin and Yvette promises not to tell anyone.Returning to their room, Morgan is prodded by Jason to recount the night's events which leads to a fight: Morgan says Jason is immature and Jason says Morgan won't confide in him and share the details. Distressed Morgan ends up sleeping in a lounge chair by the pool. Mr. T comforts a tearful Maddy and tells her that sometimes action speak louder than intentions. This inspires him to call up his new tour-guide girlfriend and ask her to use her RV to get the kids to California.The next morning, Morgan is awoken to all the students getting rid of excess luggage so they can all fit inside her Winnebago to make it to the final event of the conference, The Goodbye Dance. In the process, Maddy leaves behind her treasured telescope. The group manages to make it to the competition just in time, though Morgan, Maddy, and Jason are still tense.When Wings makes some nasty comments about Morgan and Yvette, Morgan finally stands up for himself and challenges Wings to a fight on the beach. Though he gets in one good punch, Wings beats him up pretty badly before Mr. T intervenes. Maddy comes to check on him and Morgan apologizes before trying to kiss her. Maddy rebuffs his advances, saying she will only kiss if it's serious.
She leaves him alone on the beach where, after all these years, a groggy Morgan finally spots the Friendship Pearl and crawls to it and places his hand on it. The pearl explodes emitting a very bright white light. Returning very late to the dance, Morgan gets the DJ to play the theme song from Intergalactic Friendship Alliance and dances like a crazy man or should we say a nerdy crazy kid. He encourages Jason to join in and the two make up and dance like crazy. The entire class, except Wings, lets loose and have fun on the last night of their trip.Some time passes, and Morgan surprises Maddy at a wedding where she's playing background music on a piano. She is now in a relationship, though she confides to Morgan, that her boyfriend is not a great kisser. Morgan apologizes for the past and asks if they can try being friends again. Though Maddy no longer has her telescope, the movie ends with them gazing up at the stars up at the stars with their hands holding an invisible telescope.","A high school road trip gone wrong.
