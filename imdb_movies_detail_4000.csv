To Be Determined is a documentary that examines the costs that come when chasing a dream.","Oscar, a 34 year-old from East Jersey, has been a low-stakes grinder since he was 18. Like a lot of players his age, Oscar found early success in a soft game, but has failed to adjust to an increasingly sophisticated landscape. This documentary examines the benefits and detriments baked into the pursuit of a nontraditional career, and why it can be difficult to abandon something that has defined you for so long - especially in an industry where security is elusive, but extreme wealth is possible.
Far from the glamour often associated with playing a game for a living, Oscar spends his days driving back and forth from the casino or playing online, hoping he can make $200 a day. Though he's aware his career has stagnated, Oscar's belief in his natural skill set keeps him from working at his game; his aversion to risk paradoxically blocks him from achieving financial stability. Unlike most grinders, Oscar has direct access to advice and coaching by elite poker players. His close friend and high school classmate, Christian, has overcome many of the socio-economic obstacles and industry changes that have hindered Oscar. Through Christian, Oscar is introduced to Berkey, a high-stakes pro and coach, who agrees to mentor Oscar - both on and off the felt. Leaving New Jersey for the first time in years, Oscar heads to Vegas to attend an advanced poker training academy run by Berkey's company, Solve For Why.
In Vegas, Oscar is shown just how far he's fallen behind. He continues to resist change, even though he knows it's necessary, and begins to question whether he should abandon the only career he's ever known. Upon his return to Jersey, he loses the remainder of his poker bankroll and is forced to get a job for the first time since high school. Forced into a more-traditional lifestyle, Oscar struggles to find meaning outside of the game.
After swearing off underground games years earlier when he was robbed at gunpoint, Oscar re-enters the underground poker scene and immediately starts winning again. He quits his job, believes he can continue winning without working on his game, and seems doomed to repeat his mistakes.
Parallel to Oscar's experience, in an effort to fully explore the tenuous line between success and failure, intermittent interview segments featuring some of poker's biggest names describe how skill, opportunity, and endurance all factor into the creation of a sustainable poker career. These interviews give context as to how the game has changed, what ""success"" means in a lifestyle that's inherently unstable, and why Oscar's story is one small piece of a much larger one."

This documentary follows the men and women who compete in historic automotive races held on public roads that are closed down for the weekend. Passionate drivers tests their skills and courage as they push themselves to the limit on these steep, twisty mountain courses. Every event gives witness to automotive destruction at the hands of large boulders, deep ravines and trees.The producer of this documentary has competed in hillclimbs for 25 years. Being the winningest driver in the history of the Pennsylvania Hillclimb Association has given him a keen perspective on this addictive and adrenaline filled sport that has defined his life.Chasing Giants pays homage to the oldest motorsports event in the country, the Giants Despair Hillclimb, which began in 1906. Today's drivers are literally racing in the wheel tracks of legends such as Carroll Shelby, Louis Chevrolet, and Roger Penske.Because such a small portion of the general population participates in hillclimbing, co-workers and friends back home can't relate to the range of emotions experienced over the course of a racing weekend.

Six months ago, Duncan lost everything to heroin addiction: he spent time in prison, his wife took his daughters and left him, and his parents barely speak to him. His sister, Jessie, offers him support, but struggles to raise her children with an indifferent husband and pursue her own career. Brother and sister are caught between the disapproval of their parents, Ronald and Martha, and societal expectations: to sacrifice for their families. Duncan bounces back and forth from Narcotics Anonymous meetings, teaching at a local community college with a one-strike policy, and infant birthday parties to earn back his family's broken trust and prove that anyone can change. His soon-to-be ex-wife, Tonya, is forced to give Duncan an ultimatum - he must overcome his addiction and prove it, or risk never seeing his girls again.

With the Roman coliseum as the backdrop, our hero, Nico Rothko (mid 20's) appears. In the most romantic advance Nico Rothko kneels in front of his girlfriend with a diamond wedding ring. After Nico's wedding proposal is rejected, a video of the event is uploaded to YouTube where millions of people can witness his humiliation.Months later... Back in his home city ""Megalopolis"", a ""Tinder"" swiping Nico uses the app to meet beautiful Ana (Mid 20's) and her mysterious boyfriend Noa (Mid 20's). Noa and Ana have been together in a stable relationship for four years. Both desire to experience a polyamory relationship. The couple ends up moving in with Nico into his visual artist loft while in a polyamory trio. As the relationship evolves, Noa gives Nico a gift box with a caveat: it is to be opened in a future date. Meanwhile, Nico posts their daily lives on several social media outlets.As the film progresses, we discover peculiarities of Nico's personality: so to speak, his strengths and weaknesses. On one hand, Nico is a sublime digital artist obsessed with textures and technology. On the other hand, Nico is reckless: he gamble all of his, and his family's, money in the Bitcoin rise and after months of seeing the money multiply, he loses it all when the bitcoin bubble crashes. When this happens, Nico glitches.Subsequently, Nico undergoes a rough time, unable to secure a steady job and regain the money lost to negligence but most markedly, an unfortunate event. Noa teases him regarding a couple of job opportunities in companies that Noa doesn't actually think Nico is a good candidate for. To strike back, Nico applies on-line and gets an interview for one of these jobs. However, it takes place at the same time his family will be evicted from their apartment.Nico's alcoholic mother, Santa (late 40s), is certain that before landing a job, Nico needs to solve a few behavioral issues. She in decides to contact Dr. Jimmy (55), the family's psychiatrist. Several years in the past, Dr. Jimmy treated Nico's Uncle Rudy (47) and biological father Bruno (52). Bruno is a former rock star/drug-addict/alcoholic turned life coach who never recognized any children as his own.Santa begs Dr. Jimmy for help but he refuses given that at the moment he is exclusively taking care of his daughter. However, after Dr. Jimmy finds out Nico has diabetes and a pile of severe problems including a strong technology addiction (caused by a childhood trauma), he decides to help Nico in an indirect way.Outside therapy sessions, Dr. Jimmy realizes Nico has no recollection of events before age 7. Dr. Jimmy decides during a session to confiscate Nico's smartphone to being to tackle Nico's problems. He tells Nico that there are three things he must do to correct his path. Nico must fight against his addictions and work on this fear of rejection. Nico's third problem however, unknown at this point to the audience and Nico himself, must be his priority; solving this particular issue would resolve everything.Meanwhile, Dr. Jimmy gets in touch with his old patient Bruno and tells him he has a child (Nico). Bruno denies it.Nico has a hard time without his smartphone and pisses off Noa and Ana. They both have been working on finding who Nico's biological father is. When they find out, in a desperate action they take Nico to a red carpet and show him who his father is. Nico approaches Bruno but Bruno refuses to accept that he is Nico's father. Nico breaks into Dr. Jimmy's office and steals back his cell phone and with it a child's map he finds hidden in an origami star. When Nico returns home Ana and Noa confront him and Noa leaves extremely annoyed.Bruno reflects on his life and becomes interested in Nico and the possibility of parenthood.Nico leaves the city and heads towards the woods to find out what's hidden in the map he found at Jimmy's office. Before he leaves the city, unconditional Ana jumps in on his road trip. On the way, they meet free spirited Zoe. Zoe is a twenty something year old woman that grows hemp and has never been with a man. They arrive to a cabin in the woods. Zoe notices that Nico is as cursed as if he was a glitch on an operating system. Everything he touches goes wrong and doesn't work anymore.Bruno surprises Santa with a visit to make sure Nico is his son. Through social media they follow Nico's adventure. While following their son's current life status, Santa and Bruno begin to recap Nico's childhood through photographs and old memories.In the cabin Ana, Zoe, and Nico have sex and fun while following the last steps on the map. What Nico finds at the end of the quest is an old video camera with a lot of tapes of child abuse and child pornography. One of the tapes is tagged ""Nico"". On an HI 8 tape in an old TV screen, Nico watches a seven year old version of himself abused by his uncle Rudy. He stops posting on his social networks. As this happens Bruno visits Dr. Jimmy and both discuss Nico's overreaching trauma: the event surrounding Uncle Rudy.Nico returns to the city to confront his uncle Rudy. When he arrives Bruno and his bodyguards are already there. Bruno embraces his new role as a father. Bruno makes sure no one ever hurts his son again and Kuko kills Rudy.Zoe starts to notice that Ana's polyamory behavior is caused by an unconscious desire to be a mother. We find out subtly throughout the film that Ana cannot conceive a child. Zoe offers to be the surrogate mother that Ana needs.Bruno sees the tapes for himself and the abuse perpetrated by Rudy. Yet, he doesn't know who recorded the tapes. Bruno confronts Dr. Jimmy and asks him about the maker of the videos and finds out that Dr. Jimmy was involved. Bruno realizes that everything was a plan created by Dr. Jimmy. All along, Dr. Jimmy wanted Bruno to find out so that he would get killed and in turn Dr. Jimmy's daughter could receive insurance money for her father's murder. We later find out that Bruno was not one step ahead, but it was Nico instead who stopped Bruno from killing Dr. Jimmy. Nico comes up with a better revenge against Dr.Jimmy: exposing him on social media. In such a way, Nico avoids having his father kill again and Dr. Jimmy gets a social death.Nico likes the idea of having a baby with Zoe and Ana. Nico gets a job in the company of one of Bruno's friends. A big modern family surges.Nico discovers that all the conflict was to know why he is in this world and that the creator of it all is Noa."

This is the story of his life and legacy.—RW","The story of Ric Weiland's life and legacy can be measured in incredible milestones.Narrated by Zachary Quinto and starring Bill Gates, Yes I Am - The Ric Weiland Story chronicles a queer pioneer and one of the first employees at Microsoft. Ric helped focus and organize their early successes. It made him wealthy and influential at an early age. He never felt overly comfortable with his wealth - he didn't feel that he deserved it. Other people had worked harder for what they had, he thought. So to quiet the nagging doubt, he turned to philanthropy.Out and proud since the 70's, Ric was a champion of gay rights. During his life, he donated more than 20 million dollars to fund more than 60 non-profit organizations. His efforts to establish representation and resources for the LGBT community still have a profound impact today.He also lived through the AIDS epidemic. Painful losses tempered his social life, and focused his resolve to give back to his community during a time when they desperately needed hope. Like so many of his friends, he was diagnosed with HIV. It seemed he wouldn't emerge from the crisis unscathed emotionally, or physically.As his wealth and influence grew, Ric seemed to slip further into self-doubt, depression, and a kind of impostor-syndrome that seemingly no one could talk him out of. It was clear to see from the outside looking in that he was a brilliant, impactful, and beloved person. Where was the disconnect in his own heart and mind?It's difficult to overestimate the impact that Ric had. Technology, gay rights, HIV/AIDS research funding... and the list goes on. He was one of the greatest philanthropists in American history. A founding member of one of the biggest companies on earth. But he couldn't manage the pain and doubt within his soul.Near the end of his life, he wrote, ""I've lost interest in fighting my depression and other emotions. I can't see how it would end given my circumstances.""It's a chilling reminder that no matter how much success one finds - everybody needs help... geniuses included."

Overnight, video clips of the interaction went viral, Sandmann and his classmates hit with a tidal wave of worldwide outrage, their safety threatened and the entire Cov Cath community suddenly at the center of uncomfortable conversations about racism, privilege and politics.A graduate of that elite institution, filmmaker Jonathan Schroder watched the incident-and the subsequent media blowback-with keen interest, knowing firsthand the deeply formative nature of an adolescence spent inside the entitled Covington Catholic bubble. Seeking to better understand the scene on the steps, the people involved in it and its larger ramifications for the community, the media and our democracy as a whole, Schroder set out to investigate how one fleeting interaction can become a global controversy. Along the way, The Boys in the Red Hats deftly explores the media's obsession with immediacy over accuracy, the danger in prioritizing intent over impact and what it's going to take if we ever hope to bridge the deep divides in our communities-and our country."

With Sarsour's support, El-Yateem runs for New York City council. Will he be the first Arab American to ever win a seat in the race? The documentary follows the drama of his candidacy.","Brooklyn, Inshallah follows three genuine Americans: an Arab Lutheran pastor running for NYC Council, Muslim activist Linda Sarsour, and a local community organizer, Aber Kawas. We embark on the team's journey as they attempt to make history. Arabs have lived in New York City for 100 plus years, but not one has ever aspired to run for office. In the last elections, only 250 out of 40,000 Arab Americans in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, even thought voting was worth the effort. Democracy is not working for this new American community in Brooklyn. How can they change that? How can they get a chance to tell their American story?
At first, the campaign is nothing more than a grand idea loosely grounded in reality. But idealism is not enough. The candidate and his team take to the streets to create alliances with Muslims, Christians and Jews. The camera gets access to the inner core of the campaign, and is able to document up close the Islamophobia that many Arabs face - even one who is in fact a Christian pastor. The local election is as prone to scandals and madness as a national election. But things change when the Democratic Socialists of America join the cause and suddenly, 200 young volunteers emerge onto the streets, ready to knock on doors.
In the quieter moments, we hear the backstories and what has brought these three
unique characters together with the common goal of electing the first Arab-American to city office in New York. The Christian candidate started the first Arab speaking church in North America. His story surprises. As an innocent and earnest 19-year-old theology student in Bethlehem, he was arrested, imprisoned and tortured by Israeli soldiers without charge. This incident led him to embrace nonviolent leadership and change. Linda Sarsour is the controversial, Brooklyn born Palestinian who rose to prominence as one of the three organizers and keynote speakers at the Women's March on
Washington. We see her facing down death threats, and being demonized as a
terrorist. Sarsour embodies the tension: how can this community speak out against all the forces organized to silence them? We follow Aber as she leads the campaign's laborious groundwork. She has a personal stake in this campaign: her father was deported after 9-11 by the NYPD's entrapment campaign that flagrantly violated human rights. America waged a war with Iraq and
Afghanistan but before that, they tore the heart out of the Arab American community of Bay Ridge who experience heavy police surveillance and harassment in the wake of 9-11. We explore what 9-11 has meant for this community.
On election day, we experience hope and optimism. More Arabs surge to the polls than ever before. But polling booths have translators in Spanish and Mandarin, not Arabic. Many voters are unable to vote due to language issues. Arabic translators are kicked out of the voting sites. Is the fix in? Regardless of who wins or loses, the campaign has changed Bay Ridge forever. It has given this Bay Ridge community permission to speak up, to speak out, to show that Arabs and Muslims are now also Americans, to demonstrate that they are defiantly and proudly American and that their story has to be told, as it is, finally, in Brooklyn, Inshallah. The story of Khader El-Yateem and his supporters will show all Arab Americans and non-Arab Muslims that they too can build their political power and have a voice in American politics."

The need to support new arrivals as well as situated refugees remains urgent. And the center knows something many don't: refugees are helping save their city.","Utica: The Last Refuge opens with the Azeins, a refugee family of four from Sudan, arriving at Syracuse International Airport. After spending six years in a camp in Ethiopia, they have finally made it to the US, where they are welcomed by Abdelshakour, a fellow refugee from Sudan. An employee of Utica's venerable refugee resettlement agency, he sees that they have few belongings so he gives them the winter coats he has brought with him. Nada is pregnant. They will soon be a family of five and need extra attention because they have no relatives in the area.That the Azeins have arrived in the midst of unprecedented upheaval in US policies towards refugees adds a layer of additional tension to their story. The adjustments refugees, especially those from remote rural areas, have to make to survive here are considerable. The Mohawk Valley Resource Center for Refugees (MVRCR) is regarded nationally as a model agency for how refugee resettlement is done, for how they guide Utica's refugees into comfortable jobs and lives, but they are suddenly facing new stresses. Reduced incoming numbers means a reduced budget. If their ability to assist the Azeins is compromised, their journey here becomes that much more difficult.The typical ups and downs of the Azeins' story of acclimation is softened by Utica itself. A small city rebounding after its population fell from a high of nearly 110,000 in the 1960s to a low of about 60,000, Utica is building its recovery around refugees. While the population is still only about 62,000, nearly 20% are now refugees and their children. Local politicians, from the Mayor on down, extol the virtues of Utica's diversity. The refugees, they say, are hardworking and dedicated. As of 2017, industry was returning to the area. With President Trump's inauguration that year, refugee resettlement policy changed dramatically.Questions abound. Will Utica's economic turnaround be slowed by a drop in incoming refugees? As refugee resettlement agencies across the country are forced to close their doors, will MVRCR survive? Will the Azeins find a way to support themselves? While much media attention is focused on where refugees first land, on beaches and in camps, Utica: The Last Refuge looks at why the future is so bleak for most refugees: the system is backed up."

The Tech Center where Miles' voluntarily teaches inner city teens is low on funds, and Dylan is desperate to purchase the home his deceased father built by hand, before his mother is manipulated by his weasel stepdad to put it on the market. The pay increase from the promotion could resolve their dilemmas, except only one of them can win the job.Peers and family deceive the young men into believing racial disparities always impact office politics, so assertive, yet questionable actions, may be necessary to level the playing field if they really want the job. Is ethical compromise justified for a moral cause? Miles and Dylan will journey down a rabbit hole that not only answers the question, but drops them in the middle of chaos and high jinks so wild, staying alive becomes more vital than the job!With a colorful cast (literally) of quirky characters, You're Hired, explores both internal and external perceptions and struggles of race and identity. This social satire avoids political correctness, opting to poke fun at the ignorance and insecurities that create unnecessary division. Sometimes laughing at stereotypes is simply wiser than allowing them validity, especially in today's America."

The documentary's main protagonists - Václav Havel, banned singer Marta Kubisová, and the underground rock group the Plastic People of the Universe (PPU) - became the most recognizable dissidents during the 1970-80s. Havel bridged the disparate clusters of individuals and fused the literary, musical, political, and philosophical nonviolent elements into a hybrid network that eventually toppled the totalitarian regime in 1989.The film speaks to our contemporary political malaise by underscoring the resolve and courage of dissidents who strove to re-build a battered civil society with artistry, tolerance, and truth. ""The Art of Dissent"" team presented the film to festivals with the excitement of first-time filmmakers and won five international film festival awards despite the pandemic.A unique co-production of NUtech Ventures at the University of Nebraska and Czech TV in Prague, ""The Art of Dissent"" combines rare archival footage with interviews with key dissidents filmed over three years in the Czech Republic, England, and the United States. Location interviewing began in Prague in 2017 with associate producer, Mariana Capková (a young politician) and Susan Pahlke (second camera). Thirty interviews were filmed over three years. Parallel with this, Le Sueur worked closely with Martin Bouda (Czech TV film archivist) and Alena Jirásek (Australian-based researcher and translator) to review, select, and edit the archival footage.Finding archival film and music of banned dissidents presented real challenges. How does one make a movie about ""enemies of the state"" not allowed to be filmed or photographed? Our quest brought us to the BBC and dozens of other clandestinely made films found in archives throughout Europe and America, as well as to several important private holdings in the Czech Republic. It took over two years to find and negotiate the rights for the music and films used in the movie. In this process, our team discovered forgotten film in a German archive of Shirley Bassey singing James Bond's ""Goldfinger,"" of all songs, and ""What Now My Love"" in Prague just days before the invasion. From Josef Dlouhý we learned how the police confiscated his underground documentary about the Plastic People of the Universe and threatened the young filmmaker with prison if he did not permit state TV to turn his film into a documentary broadcast on TV to demonize the musicians.In assembling the archival footage, we were also given unprecedented usage of the Czech TV archives, and Martin Bouda uncovered other rare gems, such as the never-before-used color film of the 1968 invasion discovered in the forgotten suitcase of a Catalonian businessman. The archival materials our team uncovered are extraordinary.The film is distributed by Gravitas Ventures with a release date of October 2021."

People in democratic societies tend to take their freedom for granted. Oleg Vidov's life was different: He came of age in communist Russia. Though celebrated as one of the Soviet Union's biggest movie stars, no amount of fame could save him from a system that tried to control his life. And so began Oleg's desperate struggle for freedom-a journey that would culminate in his attempt to sneak across the border without being shot.Overview:
This feature documentary utilizes excerpts from Oleg Vidov's autobiography read as narration to communicate the story, punctuated by clips from feature films and soundbites from expert historians, journalists, actors and directors, friends and family members. The production team conducted extensive interviews in Europe, Russia and the United States with people who witnessed Mr. Vidov's meteoric rise to movie stardom, his persecution, escape and subsequent life as an expatriate in America.Topic Summary:
Oleg Vidov was a star whose life became an anxious struggle against nefarious forces that tried to end his career. This feature documentary explores Vidov's immigration story, the issues of state justice and morality, and contrasts the Soviet and American systems as they played out in Oleg's life. A major subplot is Mr. Vidov's acting career and the rare opportunity he received to work on international co-productions outside the Soviet Union where he could see how other people lived.At a time when many are concerned about Vladimir Putin's Russia, the rise of authoritarianism, and the degradation of the rule of law, this feature documentary offers compelling testimony from a popular figure who endured privation and persecution before escaping to the West and achieving the American dream. Entertaining and enlightening, Oleg's story offers hope to a new generation of immigrants seeking freedom and human rights.The producers have assembled an international team of award-winning filmmakers who have had direct access to Mr. Vidov's family and friends for over a year.

Junho was a member of a prestigious Changbi theater troupe led by (the iron grip) of 'Master Lee'. Even though Changbi culture was harsh to newcomers with regard to its stringent hierarchy and law, Junho excelled. As a key to his success, Junho had the support of his colleague and best friend, Jin.
The film begins in Korea with a brief glimpse into the past to a Changbi initiation ceremony, then fast forwards to the present. We see Junho arrive at SFO International Airport a visibly changed man; one who is drained of his youthful optimism. He arrives at the home of Chang, a former senior member of the Changbi troupe and begins to work on his food truck.
Chang invited Junho with the understanding that he had knowledge of the crimes committed by Master Lee, which includes Chang's culpability. Chang grows nervous and fears that this information will jeopardize the new life that he has created for himself. One evening after a long day of work, Chang confronts Junho. Reluctantly, Junho opens up and names a long list of female members of Changbi, who were sexually abused by Master Lee - including his best friend Jin.
Junho is haunted by his past. We see him venture through the beautiful scenery of the Bay Area, immersing himself in his new reality. But the memories and lingering attachment to his craft unshakably haunt him.
Tormented by the loss of his dream, and not being able to protect Jin, Junho finds catharsis in an open stage in San Francisco. Dressed up as what could have been his career-making role, Junho plays the truth, the sorrow, and the rage at a place where no one knows his past, can relate to his truth or understand the depths of his sincerity."

Through a local church ministry, Norm accepts Christ as his savior, despite his parents' disinterest and resistance. Norm's life is transformed as he joins in ministering to his community, even discovering that he has almost photographic memory as he strives to learn to read the Bible. One day as he evangelizes on the street, a drunk stumps him with an objection to Christianity, and Norm realizes he has no real answers about the faith in which he has placed his trust. This begins his twenty-year educational journey, gaining multiple degrees, including a doctorate, in his search for answers. His newfound knowledge could not have come at a better time, as a battle for the truth of the Bible arises in the church. Norm emerges as a crucial leader in the crafting of three interdenominational statements that provide a logical, evidence-based defense of biblical inerrancy. This endeavor catapults him forward as an author, speaker, and teacher, even as he begins to realize a new need is growing. Due to the church's retreat from engaging in social governance and relying on preaching blind faith, the changing cultural morals beginning to take shape in the 1960's have been left unchallenged, and are beginning to cause widespread corruption and destruction. Almost single handedly, Norm steps forward into the gap to challenge the top atheists and new age philosophers to public debate. He pioneers respectful, logical discussions on the relationship between faith and reason, introducing a bold new model for Christian influence. Students flock to his classes as he founds multiple seminaries to teach the answers he has found, and a new generation of evidence-based believers is born. Meanwhile, a young woman named Grace begins her own search for answers. Although she was raised as a pastor's kid, she cannot find the answers Norm has been sharing anywhere in the church, and rejects the faith she was taught. Her inability to find the truth leads her to want to end her life, until God leads her to Norm. His teachings provide the answers she was looking for, and her faith in God and joy in life is restored. However, as Grace finds her faith, Norm's daughter turns from hers, taking her own life. Norm must face the great pain of losing his beloved child, armed only with the answers he has learned about the character of God and the problem of pain. It is only through these truths that he is able to stand firm in his faith and heal from the loss. Looking back over his career, his students and mentees recognize that God raised Norm up at a pivotal time in the history of the church and society. They share the influence he had on their work, not only in the answers he gave, but in the way he lived the truths he learned."

Taking over in the midst of World War II, Aileen Eaton built a sports empire that lasted nearly four decades, launching stars and becoming the most powerful boxing promoter in America. As the years passed, Eaton's Olympic promotion mirrored the changing tastes and demographics of the city, thriving in large part due to the loyalty of Mexican-American fans.

The film chronicles eight artists living and working in the San Francisco Bay Area, who are guided by a belief that creativity is a tool for societal change. In an age of hyper-capitalism, these artists represent an empowering alternative worldview, one that emphasizes creativity over capital. We see these artists using their work to address the most pressing issues of our time; Environmental Justice, Racial Equity, Prison Reform, Homelessness, Feminism, and Income Inequality. This film offers a reminder to communities around the globe that creativity exists everywhere, and every creation is a gift offered to the future.Framed within the last 25 years of art-making in the Bay Area, the film is not an all-encompassing historical document, but rather a glimpse into a select group of artists who've chosen a less worn path. It touches on the disappearance of cultural communities due to gentrification and economic instability and reminds us of how vital creative communities are to healthy societies and political change.The title, Tell Them We Were Here, is a statement made to the director by legendary poet and author Bill Berkson. It is a reminder that We are the Archive and the champions of our own history. The stories we choose to tell, are the ones that live on in history.

seen footage, the film will harness Jose Sarria's bold spirit to expose his tragic, valiant andinspiring story. At the unexpected intersection between politics and high camp, Nelly Queen
will reveal an intimate portrait of the Latino civil rights pioneer whose heroic drag has long
been overlooked as a cornerstone of the gay rights movement.
Nelly Queen opens up with Jose's lavish, gothic San Francisco funeral attended by 1,000
people including hundreds of gender nonconformists. We hear testimonies about Jose's
impact on the LGBT movement from politicians San Francisco County Supervisor David
Campos and California State Senator Mark Leno, historians Dr. Jonathan D. Katz, and
young gender nonconformists like Gene Franco of San Francisco. The film shows the many
character incarnations of Jose: World War II soldier, cabaret performer, and the Widow
Norton and operas are highlighted with vintage photos and live audio recordings from 1963.
The film's divided into titled chapters taken from Jose's own slogans, beginning with ""You
know who you are when you look in the mirror""; which is a phrase Jose hangs his
philosophical mantra on and it personally resonates with Joe Castel, the narrator, and man
behind the camera.
In the ""You're in the Army Now"" segment, Jose uses humorous antidotes to expound on the
lengths he went to in order to survive the severity of war. Castel's commentary contextualizes
how Jose's wartime experiences prepare him for the impending homophobic war back home.
He pursues a teaching degree at San Jose State, joins a fraternity, and even becomes engaged
to a woman, but his act starts to fall apart when he falls for waiter Jimmy Moore from the
Black Cat Cafe. Jose delves into his childhood and how well-adjusted he was, despite his
mother Dolores Maldonado having to give him up when his father abandons them. She's the
one who put him in girl's clothing as a toddler and allowed him to attend dances dressed as a
female adolescent.
In the chapter, ""Gay is Good, the Crime is Getting Caught"", Jose describes how one
night he is arrested in the St. Frances restroom on trumped-up charges of lewd and lascivious
behavior. Unable to teach with a police record, Jose regretfully drops out of college. At the
Black Cat, Jose goes from waiting tables to cabaret performer and activist. Jose boasts that
every Sunday he packs the Cat with 200 patrons to see his operas, and during his shows, Jose
exposes undercover police officers by forcing them to identify themselves in accordance with
the laws of the time.
In the segment, ""God, Save Us Nelly Queens"" Jose does a reenactment of his days at the
Black Cat during a 1992 performance at a bar in Hayward, CA. At 70, we see him serve
brunch to customers like he used to dress all in black and wearing pearls, leading the patrons
into a round of ""God, Save Us, Nelly Queens,"" a takeoff on Great Britain's national anthem.
In ""United We Stand, Divided They'll Catch Us one by One,"" Jose recalls how he
and the Cat's proprietor Sol Stouman, took the A.B.C. to court over ordinances that
discriminated against their gay patrons. In 1951, Sol took the State's liquor license agency to
the State's Supreme Court, winning a landmark decision that allowed gays to congregate in
public. Jose tells us that as his notoriety ascended, his relationship with Jimmy began to
suffer.In ""Equality for All Under the Law,"" Jose recounts the difficulty he had in running,
but also how he unified the community. Although he loses, he wins 5,600 votes, proving
that there is a gay voting block. Jose's political career comes to an abrupt halt when he is
rearrested during one of his shows, for not reregistering as a ""sexual deviant.""
""I'm A Boy,"" highlights the closing of the Cat in1963, when ABC announces that the
The café will be shut down at midnight on Halloween. To avoid anyone being arrested, Jose
circumvents the law by having everyone in drag wear a tag that reads: ""I'm A Boy."" Jose
shows his patrons that they can stand up for their rights if they believe in themselves.
After the Cat closes, Jose tries to reunite with Jimmy, and though he initially agrees to get
back together, Jimmy realizes he will only hold Jose back, and commits suicide.
In 1964, Jose reinvents himself as the ""Empress I, Jose, The Widow Norton"", launching
the Imperial Court System. Every year, after San Francisco's Imperial Court Coronation, the
Widow Norton, leads his subjects through the cemetery to pay their respects to his fictitious
spouse, Emperor Joshua Norton (a real San Francisco character from the late 1800s). Castel
surmises that Jose created this alter ego as a way of mourning the death of Jimmy. The irony
is that Jose never visited Jimmy's military grave until Castel takes him there in 2010. Castel
also tapes Jose shortly before his passing and describes how Jose dies with a photo of Jimmy
in his hands. Jose was able to circumvent the law for equality, but he couldn't circumvent the
laws of love.
We close the film with a taping of Castel's screenplay reading of Jose's life, ""The Black Cat""

From the realities of a crumbling economy, to the ravages of the opioid epidemic, to the irreparable environmental damage and its tragic impact on human health - the film is a cautionary tale of unfettered corporate power, and an elegy to a vanishing Appalachia.—BIG TENT PRODUCTIONS","When West Virginia broke away from Virginia in 1861 at the start of the American Civil War, its founders did not agree upon the Confederacy or the role of the state in the war. They were, however, united in their interests around the extraction and exploitation of the rich resources of the state - predominantly coal and timber - what would prove to be the dominant theme throughout the history of West Virginia.""Devil Put the Coal"" is holistic look at the impact of this legacy and the ravages of extractive industry and corporate power, as it has affected the people, communities and the environment of West Virginia. Consciously eschewing exploitive filmmaking around the opioid epidemic or poverty, the film focuses on its people - all linked by the love of their home state and desire to stay put against all odds.By design, the film is structured upon personal storytelling from native West Virginians, drawing upon their rich experiences and diverse perspectives in order to create an informal ""People's History of West Virginia"". These individuals run the gamut - from recovering opioid addict, to environmental activist, to U.S. Congressional candidate, to town judge, to recovery center nurse, to corporate environmental lawyer, to struggling local business owner - all of whom, despite their differences, remain linked by the love of their home state and the challenges that threaten their survival, and way of life.Uniquely paced and stylistically arresting, the film marries personal narrative with cinematic aerial footage, rare archival photography from DOCUMERICA luminary Jack Corn, bespoke animation and an original score that features the music of Steve Earle & Iris Dement - at once a meditation on the mystique of coal culture, a people's resilience and deep connection to the land, and elegy to a vanishing Appalachia."

Racing time, they see the world fade around them, and letters and envelopes seem to be all that's left for mankind.","The film starts with three friends playing football during a storm. One of the friends, Jacob, is shot with a dart by a mysterious shooter. Because he was shot the moment lightning flashed, the other friends, Davis and Michael, assume Jacob was struck by lightning. The mysterious shooter runs over to Jacob, removes the dart, and pretends he is checking on Jacob. The friends take Jacob home and get him medicine while he is sleeping. When they wake him up, they find he is gone. Davis quickly finds him outside. Jacob is talking to an imaginary person, Ava, and can't see or hear Davis and Michael. During a dinner between Jacob and Ava, Michael slips him a note informing him of the situation. Jacob realizes he is insane and takes the medicine.Jacob is now better, but he is afraid of people, preferring to remain alone. While walking in the park, two people picnic near him, causing Jacob to hide. He trips and cuts his leg, but then wakes up in his bed. The next day, Davis is making dinner and asks Michael if he thinks Jacob remembers cutting his leg a few days ago, to which Michael replies that he probably wouldn't because he was asleep the whole time. Jacob, sick of being treated like a child, runs away. By the time Davis and Michael find him, he is unconscious in a pool of blood.The film flashes forward three months to the three friends, including Jacob, stealing donuts from an empty bakery. While driving home, they discuss life as the only humans left and trying to find their purpose in life. The film cuts to black as Michael screams, ""What the hell is that?"" The film flashes back three months to where it left off before the flash-forward.The three friends are watching the news, which informs them of a new deadly disease taking the world by storm. They are informed that any blood exposure within the last few months would guarantee they were exposed. Jacob is visibly distressed, remembering when he passed out in the pool of blood. Davis and Michael had thought he committed suicide, but a doctor reveals in a flashback that one of his stitches from the previous wound had simply burst open. Jacob is convinced he has the deadly disease, and after the cure is destroyed, the friends take him downtown to get his mind off of it. While at the restaurant downtown, the news breaks that one billion people had died from the disease. Jacob opens up about his imaginary friend, Ava, and reveals she was inspired by the real Ava he was about to ask out before deciding to play football with the friends in the storm. They come up with a theory that Ava created the disease and is using it to bring the world population down to Jacob and her, so that he can't ever choose anyone else over her. They also theorize that she made him immune by hiring the mysterious shooter to inject him with a sort of vaccination. A lab is shown revealing the real Ava working with Daniel, the mysterious shooter, to complete the formula. When he is finished, she poisons him with a glass of lemonade.One day, the three friends wake up to no sounds, no news, and no people. They were the last people alive on Earth. They decide to get an upgrade. A mysterious person, dressed as a robber, goes inside the friend's house and finds it empty. He takes off his mask to reveal Corben, a fourth alive person. He makes a sandwich and remarks that there has to be someone else out there. The friends arrive at a new, nicer house. They find no dead people inside, so they decide to stay. An envelope marked with the letter A drifts by the window.Deciding there is really no one left, they decide to go to a bakery and get some donuts. In the scene from the flash-forward plays, instead of cutting to black, the friends find Corben at a park. Excited to see another person, they talk to him and invite him over. They show him their house and invite him to stay, but he tells him he is happy with the house he moved into (the friends' old house). When Corben gets home, Ava is waiting for him. She thinks he is Jacob, but after finding out she is wrong, she recruits him and reveals that it was Jacob who engineered the disease and destroyed the cure. The friends find the letter A envelope in their backyard and read it. The letter teases that if they find all 26 envelopes in the order of the alphabet, they can find the cure and bring humanity back. They slowly find all of the envelopes, leaving only W, X, Y, and Z. One night, while looking for W, Jacob leaves to get them all some food. While out, Jacob encounters Corben and tells him about the envelopes, but Ava jumps out and kidnaps Jacob. Jacob and Corben are tied up together in a garage and are able to work out the truth that Ava is behind everything. They escape the ropes, but just before they can leave, Ava catches them. She lets Corben go but keeps Jacob. She tells him that he has to kill his friends or she will kill him. He refuses, and she leaves him locked in there, while she goes to get the envelopes. Corben gets the friends from their house, and they go to rescue Jacob but leave the house empty allowing Ava to take the envelopes. After rescuing Jacob, both the friends and Ava race to a park where they assume envelope Y and Z will be. Once at the park, they split up. Michael looks in Ava's car, Davis looks for envelopes Y and Z, and Jacob and Corben look for Ava. Jacob and Corben find Ava and confront her. Davis runs over with Y and Z, and Michael runs over empty-handed. Ava gets away, taunting them that they need all 26 envelopes to crack the code. Jacob and Corben try to go after them, but Michael stops them and reveals he had envelopes A-X in his pocket. Far away, Ava pulls over and checks her hiding place in her car. It is empty, and she knows she has lost. The friends open up the envelopes and successfully bring everyone back to life."

Once a year, the harvesting of the season's grapes shows the beauty of both nature and humanity.","A Wonderful Kingdom is a visual feast, a poetic meditation on heritage winemaking, and, above all, a love letter to Portugal. Stepping outside the conventions of standard wine documentaries and travelogues, this cinematic journey takes viewers into the heart and soul of Portugal's Douro Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage site and the oldest demarcated wine region in the world.Defined in many ways by its geography, the uniqueness of this province, Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro, lies in its isolation and challenging climate. Here, where little can be farmed but grapes, olives, and almonds, dusty hills were terraced to give grape vines maximum exposure to the sun, and the land took on the particular contours that define its beauty today.The art of cultivating the valley's fruits and transforming them into distinctive varieties of wine has been passed on, generation after generation, for nearly 300 years. Each September, this tradition of winemaking comes fully alive in the hearts and hands of the people who gather from nearby towns and villages to work the vineyards.From the valley's harsh soil and intimidating terrain, comes one of the most beautiful rituals of the year: the fall wine harvest. While introducing viewers to process and local culture, this is more a film about the human spirit: a story of triumph over adversity, the preservation of tradition in the face of globalization, and the admirable labors of ordinary people who have not only adapted to an inhospitable climate-they have made the most of it.Casting their work in a noble light and the Douro Valley as an enchanted land, the words of late Portuguese literary giant Miguel Torga set the tone for the film's voiceover. His poetic observations are all the more stirring when delivered through the commanding voice of one of Hollywood's most legendary actors, Malcolm McDowell, who narrates ""A Wonderful Kingdom"". Together, these artists convey something of the essence of Portugal-earthy, proud, sensual, self-sufficient-teasing out what is mythic and profound about the reality of the Transmontanos, a people hunched over the soil for generations.One part slow cinema, one part observational documentary, A Wonderful Kingdom is a portrait of the Douro Valley and a meditation on place, time, work, and tradition. There is no gimmickry, no reliance on exposition, and there are no interviews with vineyard owners. From the visual style to the editing choices to the music and sound design, every detail of the film echoes the attention to craft the film celebrates.The repetition of the traditional wine harvest is a back-breaking process: picking and transporting grapes from across the valley and crushing them by foot, day after day.But people fall into a rhythm with such work, and the film taps into the sense of time in which this work is done. In editing the film, it was paramount to find and meticulously craft a completely different sense of time than what viewers may be used to.
Moving away from clock-based, industrial time, and away from faster editing styles that are the hallmark of advertising and Hollywood-influenced cinema, the film allows moments to unfold as fully as possible and calls attention to the rhythms inherent in the work, the land, and the dance between people and nature.Rather than entertaining or aiming to merely inform, the film instead seeks to elicit a hypnotic effect that moves the viewer deeper into the experience.Slow tracking shots evoke the time it takes to harvest grapes and handcraft wine, while stunning aerial views give the Douro River and the valley's striking cliffs and steep vineyard slopes extra gravitas. Picking up on the rhythm of the editing and amplifying the impact of the visuals, both the music and sound design ebb and flow the way the work itself does.
Taken together, the deliberateness of this cinematic approach allows the viewer to feel that they are soaring above the land, toiling in the field, moving among the wine presses, or heartily dining with the Transmontanos after a hard day's work.The film is meant to induce a certain calm, a certain state of mind, a certain sense of intimacy, and, above all, to transport the audience to the wonderful kingdom.From its gritty characters and their boisterous camaraderie to its captivating vistas, evocative contrasts, and the earthy abundance it captures, A Wonderful Kingdom is an homage to a place, its people, and a way of life. In a world that too often stresses short-term gains and short-lived trends, this film slows down to celebrate the opposite: longevity, continuity, quality, heritage, and the rugged alchemy that turns grapes into wine and labor into pleasure-a sacred process in the Douro Valley, perfected by the ancestors of the Transmontanos centuries ago and one that, no doubt, will be carried on by their children for centuries more."

In the 1970s, young people in Minnesota radicalized by the Vietnam War created a thriving counterculture economy featuring dozens of food cooperatives. But they had differing ideas about what the co-ops were for: Hippie socializing? Cheap bulk foods? Black liberation? Whole foods education? Anarchist experimentation? Marxist revolution? In the midst of this burgeoning movement a charismatic stranger formed a secretive revolutionary group that was willing to seize the co-ops by force to bring about their vision of social transformation. The ensuing struggle pitted friends and comrades against each other in a passionate clash of ideas about equity, inclusion, health, and democracy. Long after natural foods have become mainstream, this debate over who and what the co-ops are for finds echoes in the struggle for food justice today. THE CO-OP WARS captures a pivotal moment in the history of Baby Boomer politics and demonstrates the unique nature of cooperatives as vessels for community-directed social change. It is a documentary sure to be thought-provoking for co-op members and everyone interested in creating a better world.—Erik Esse",

Arch nemesis Gwen and Margo are stranded on the island waiting for a boat.
Gwen is the fragile soul. She is scared, resentful and judgmental. Margo is her opposite. She is strong forgiving and faithful.
Gwen's religious faith is the foundation of her existence. Margo, on the other hand, has a strong connection with nature and the island. The boat may come at any time from behind the mist in the horizon: there is no way to predict when that will happen.
While they wait, the women pass the time praying and reliving their old grievances. Their common past invokes love, jealousy, and different beliefs. From loving the same men and the same people, to competing for a place in their society of power and recognition, they see each other as the one to be blamed for their own shortcomings in life. Gwen, at one point, defends, ""We are one people. We should not be divided."" Margo is offended by Gwen's idea of unity, which means Margo and her son Margo must adhere to Gwen's religion. So much disagreement precludes them from developing a proper female bond in spite of their plausible sisterhood.
But stuck with each other, they decide to talk. As time passes, the women go from finding common ground to trying to forgive each other. As Gwen opens her mind to understanding Margo, the latter learns of her own troubles moving on from her pain caused by Gwen.

We live in a time of hyper-connectivity and hyper-accessibility. The ways in which people are able to connect and explore have never been easier, yet studies show that we have never been less knowledgeable. While the average person spends over six hours a day consuming digital media, attention spans have been reduced to a minimum as people swipe their way through the day.
In spite of the increasing rate at which the world turns, there is a growing number of photographers actively choosing to take a step back and consider a more mindful approach to their work.
Some would say these photographers are nostalgic hipsters who hate technology and are desperate to differentiate themselves when in reality, they are tech-savvy and very aware of its advantages. Ironically enough, many have built careers primarily through the exposure that only Instagram can afford. Thanks in part to social media, people all over the world, including celebrities, are getting hip to the wonders of analog photography. Whether it's Kendall Jenner showing off her Contax T2 on The Tonight Show or Frank Ocean shooting film at the 2019 Met Gala, analog photography has found its way back into the cultural landscape.
The democratizing effect of the internet has catapulted analog photography from the basements of hobbyists and purists to the hands of people everywhere.
1.8 billion photographs are uploaded to the internet every day. Hashtags like #filmisnotdead and #staybrokeshootfilm account for over 50 million Instagram posts to date. While many people have accused Instagram of killing photography via over-saturation, it as undoubtedly served has fuel for an analog renaissance.
The choice to use film, both as a way to explore the depths of their subjects as well as their craft, is an active one for today's analog photographer.
They are predominantly photographers who were born at a time when the internet and digital cameras were not yet around. A generation built by the nostalgia of printed magazines and family albums in living rooms.
In 2012 Kodak declared bankruptcy after struggling to keep up with an industry rapidly adopting digital practices. Today, the company has doubled in value and struggles to keep up with increasing demand for film.
While interest in analog photography grows, so does the community of people dedicated to keeping it alive. Community darkrooms, for example, make the physical process of being a photographer accessible as well as the visceral experience of viewing a peer's work in progress. On a larger scale, brands have also taken an interest in analog photography as a means to rectify public backlash against digitally manipulated images. By acknowledging movements such as #NoPhotoshop, brands now encourage and celebrate the wonders of analog.
GRAIN documents the processes of photographers who are shooting for major brands, as well as fine artists who require more than what digital can offer.
The film takes us into the analog labs, that were once crippled by the pivot to digital, and are now racing to keep up with demand.
Through the world of analog photography, we illustrate a movement that is not necessarily anti-digital, but pro-experimentation"

Witness the obsessive lengths to which people will go to bring their greatest fears to life on screen - and why. It's not just about blood and boobs, zombies and vampires.We follow the life of small-town creator Mike Lombardo as he writes, directs, shoots, and re-shoots (and re-shoots) the Lovecraftian horror ""The Stall"" and the ghost movie parody ""Long Pig."" He does makeup FX on dozens of actors on the set of Jeff Heimbach's adaptation of Brian Keene's ""Fast Zombies Suck."" Throughout, viewers are privy to candid moments that inform Lombardo's inner drive - from his giddy triumph at successful DIY special effects to his painful personal crises to the everyday tedium of working at a pizza shop.Along the way, interviews with fierce women filmmakers, other grassroots directors, horror experts, and misunderstood fans bring fascinating diversions and unexpected viewpoints.
Author Cynthia Freeland asks why there aren't more female monsters as we see filmmaker Julie Ufema O'Connor direct ""Caveat,"" a story of five sisters and revenge. Film journalist Heidi Honeycutt outlines the ingredients that go into making a good independent low-budget horror film and slams men who don't take it seriously and are in it just to take advantage of scream queens. Filmmaker Jason Pohlig insists it's about warping people's minds and making them as uncomfortable as possible. Researcher Joanne Cantor explains how fear and empathy play out in our brains when watching a horror movie and why some people are prone to dislike it. Filmmaker Jeremiah Kipp voices his love of story and his view that epic emotions expressed through horror get us closer to our own reality. Horror fan Scott Jeune reflects on how watching monsters was an antidote to his own interior terror. Filmmaker Thomas Norman talks about putting one's phobias on screen like with his movie ""Gitchy"" about a clown who tickles people to death. Director Ashley Thorpe delves into the neglected aspects of British folklore through animation inspired by his haunting Devon backdrop. Filmmaker Micah Ginn describes the tricky practicalities of bringing a Cajun werewolf to life, struggling to stand up on stilts and dealing with constant hair in the mouth. Filmmaker Paula Haifley expresses her nerdy rockabilly sensibility, creating movies with classic monsters and goofy scares.At times hilarious, at times repulsive, and at times weirdly moving, ""The Brilliant Terror"" is not only for horror fans, but for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider. It helps us understand why we all, in some way, need a place to belong - and why that place may well be lying with friends on a cold, dirty bathroom stall floor wrangling (and re-wrangling) bloody, slime-covered tentacles. Speaking to the psycho-entrepreneur in us all, Lombardo says, ""It's not going to be easy, but it's going to be awesome."""

The Songpoet offers a look into the mind, soul and creative process of this multifaceted, complex and singularly driven artist whose career saw great expectations waylaid by misfortune.Set against the backdrop of American folk music, The Songpoet follows Andersens 50-year journey that took him from the Beat coffeehouses in North Beach, San Francisco to the folk clubs in Greenwich Village, New York City, to Japan as the first American singer-songwriter to tour that country and ultimately to his home in the Netherlands and to Europe where he continues to write, record and perform as well as pursue his new found artistic passion for abstract photography. More than a biography, the film is also a statement on the culture of fame, the fragility of an artists career and the integrity of the artist."

This film exposes how they did it.","Is nuclear fusion a likely solution to climate change? Is fusion a viable alternative to fossil fuels?For 70 years, fusion scientists have proposed new design concepts, provided computer models, and proclaimed that fusion is the answer.But where is the experimental evidence that the scientific method demands? And why has energy from nuclear fusion always been 20 years away?In a 1993 hearing, nuclear fusion research representatives convinced the U.S. Congress to spend public money on ITER, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. ITER, they said, was the way to fusion energy. Elected officials in Europe, Japan, and the Soviet Union also agreed to fund ITER. Later, China, India, and South Korea joined the partnership. The revised estimated cost, including parts, is now $65 billion.For experimental evidence of progress, the representatives implied that, in 1997, the Joint European Torus (JET) fusion reactor produced thermal power from fusion at a rate of 66 percent of the total reactor input power. That foundation, as it turns out, was flawed. The power produced by JET was only 1 percent of the total reactor input power.With this false foundation, they proposed the ITER reactor, which, they implied, would produce ten times the power it would consume. This promise was also flawed. If ITER works as planned, the overall reactor will produce power at the same rate as it consumes power. Although this result would accomplish its scientific objective - a tenfold gain of plasma heating power - the overall reactor output will be equivalent to a zero net-power reactor.Fusion representatives told Congress, the public, and the news media that the ITER reactor would produce ""500 megawatts of fusion power"" and that it would prove that fusion on Earth is commercially viable. These false impressions took root decades ago and, by 2017, had been established as apparent fact as shown in records from the European Commission, European Parliament, U.S. Congress, fusion industry partners, educational organizations, and news organizations.Was it all just a big misunderstanding? Did leaders of the fusion community fail to see the cause-and-effect relationship of their consistently poor public communications? Or did they have an unspoken agreement that false appearances of fusion progress were necessary to maintain public excitement and public funding for fusion?ITER, The Grand Illusion: A Forensic Investigation of Power Claims, featuring members of Congress, prominent representatives of the fusion community, and the two former representatives of the ITER organization, reveals the details of this story."
