INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION at IDFA 2022In this masterwork of a career-long investigation into collective memory, Rea Tajiri shares the camera with her mother, Rose Tajiri Noda, chronicling a sixteen year journey as Rose's care partner following her diagnosis with dementia. A duet of both care and cinematic creation, WISDOM GONE WILD captures Rose's daily life while sprawling across time, as Rose's memories emerge from everyday encounters, songs, dreams, and anxieties.A family history comes into focus: of Japanese farmers in the Salinas strawberry fields, of internment camp survivors and their children, of an archive co-created by a family of artists. In 1989 footage that punctuates the film, Rose and Rea pass the camera back and forth to one another, and Rea shares the difficulty she's having with ""the tape about our family""-what would go on to become her canonical History and Memory: For Akiko and Takashige.If History and Memory investigates how traumatic historical memories have been suppressed for the next generation to decipher and articulate, WISDOM GONE WILD is a celebration of memory as a collaborative medium, force, and wisdom. The film opens with Rea's recollection of Rose doing headstands every morning while she was growing up. A practicing yogi, Rose was told by her guru that yogis could travel through time and communicate with their ancestors using their ""heart radio."" WISDOM GONE WILD moves to the tempo of this heart radio: Rose sees Rea as her sister who died at fifteen, takes on Rea's memories as her own, and calls out to Akiko, Rose's name at birth, changed by a former teacher. Communing with ancestors, her deceased relatives, and her daughter in Chicago, Rose holds space for her ancestors and children to speak.-Kim-Anh Schreiber"

Described as ""...one of the greatest American dancers of our age,"" Lewitzky became a strong advocate for the arts, and the development of Los Angeles as a global dance center. Lewitzky's childhood was spent in San Bernardino, California. Surrounded by mountains, the desert landscape of this area will be used as a metaphor for her physical and emotional development as an artist. The wide-open spaces, textures, colors and sparse vistas mixed with a social consciousness instilled by her parents set the stage for her work and life.—Bridget Murnane","Based in Los Angeles in the 1930's and 40's Lewitzky was the primary developer of the Horton dance technique. Her students included Alvin Ailey and Carmen de Lavallade who went on to form the Alvin Ailey Dance Company in New York City. The Horton technique is taught world-wide, and unlike modern techniques developed in the eastern United States, is based on Native American dance. In Lewitzky, Horton found the body upon which he would build his technique, a uniquely west coast modern dance, historically under-represented in the lexicon of dance and cultural history. Social injustice, anti-fascism, American and Mexican history were some of the themes of Horton's dances embodied by dancers committed to these themes in their daily lives. Living in a multicultural neighborhood in Echo Park, Los Angeles, during the depression, Lewitzky was very much an artist/citizen of her time, committed to her art, community, family and society as a whole. Lewitzky's exposure to other cultures and perspectives clearly influenced her beliefs, ""... (it) is a privileged way to grow, because it is growing in that life where you see the culture and you take part in it...."" Although many think multiculturalism is a relatively new phenomenon in Los Angeles, integrated neighborhoods have existed for a very long time, but with histories not often documented. It is essential to look at these histories to understand the political and artistic development of Bella Lewitzky.Being a modern dancer in Los Angeles at this time did not provide a sustainable income. To support herself and her family Lewitzky worked under the Federal Theatre Project in works choreographed by Horton and others. She also assisted Horton on film projects as well as Hanya Holm and Agnes DeMille. The support of this program was essential to the well-being and development of many artists during the ""New Deal."" The effect of the program was enormous as it kept hundreds of artists employed. In Los Angeles, many moved into the ""Hollywood"" system, as did Bella, often performing as a background dancer, featured dancer or dance assistant. Although the history of the ""Hollywood Entertainment Industry"" has been well documented, those artists in the background who moved between mainstream entertainment and art have not been addressed. These films, often full of racial, class and sexist stereotypes, featured Lewitzky as the ""exotic"" one, e.g., credited as a ""specialty dancer"" in White Savage where she danced on a large drum as a ""native."" Although the veneer of these films was white, privileged and male, the reality of who made the work often differed when it came to the lower echelons of the credits or ""uncredited"" crew. There were many historical intersections between the mainstream and artistic communities in Los Angeles at this time, and I would like to examine how these intersections affected Lewitzky, her community, and the development of the arts in Los Angeles.In 1950 Lewitzky and Horton parted ways. Lewitzky felt a need to develop her own choreographers and ultimately opened a small studio, Dance Associates, on the other side of Hollywood. She recalls, ""... one day a gentleman with a hat on... handed me a subpoena."" She was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee where she pleaded the Fifth Amendment. Her life took a drastic turn following these events. While most Americans are familiar with HUAC and the famous producers, directors, writers and ""The Hollywood Ten,"" who were called before it, many are unaware of those like Lewitzky who were not famous and had no power base within the industry. Some have inferred that she was named due to her support of the integration of dance/ballet schools. Although she was called before the committee only once, every time the committee came back to Los Angeles for hearings her case and picture were prominently featured in the media. She could not ""safely"" work in films, colleagues would cross the street to avoid her, she received threatening phone calls, friends had rocks throw through their windows. The only person who would hire her at this time was Agnes DeMille who brought Lewitzky on as her assistant on the movie ""Oklahoma,"" with the stipulation that Lewitzky would not receive credit. After this Lewitzky did not work for ten years. She later stated, ""It really is frightening when you can realize that your safety and right to life can be removed from you and that your enemy is never seen, is hidden, and that your accusers cannot be confronted because you don't know who they are.""In 1966 Lewitzky founded the Bella Lewitzky Dance Company. Unlike her earlier works, which were dramatic and socially conscious, her new choreography emphasized pure movement, and her dancers became noted for their strength, line, elevation, and agility-a tribute to her gifts as a teacher. She also became the founding dean of the School of Dance at the California Institute of the Arts where she developed a multicultural/inter-arts approach to teaching modern dance. She worked tirelessly to promote dance in California and sat on many national panels and boards. In 1984 she accepted an offer from the Los Angeles Olympic Arts Festival to produce its dance component bringing in such international companies as Pina Bausch's Wuppertal Dance Theatre, and Japan's Sanki Juku, for the first time to the United States. In addition, she presented local Hispanic, Asian and African American groups who received national and international exposure putting Los Angeles and California on the cultural dance map for the first time.In 1990 Lewitzky refused to sign an anti-obscenity clause on the acceptance form of a $72,000 National Endowment for the Arts grant. A clear intersection of art and politics Lewitzky stated, ""Please watch out. This is a pattern with which I am very familiar and it has nothing to do with pornography. Pornography is simply the demagogic weapon that permitted mind rule and censorship to move forward."" Unable to meet their payroll, her company disbanded as she joined with People for the American Way to sue the NEA director John Frohnmayer. Lewitzky prevailed in this landmark case and was finally awarded the grant. The NEA was instructed to ""take into consideration general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public."" This process took time away from Lewitzky's choreography and fund raising. After a re-organization she decided to close her company with a final international tour and gala. On May 17, 1997 at the Luckman Theatre at Cal State LA, the campus where her company gave its first performance, she said good-bye to her audience and stated, ""The arts are under threat more than ever before. What legacy I have left here will die unless you become responsible for keeping it alive."" This case and the actions of the NEA changed the funding structure for the arts in the United States. Individual grants are no longer given to artists, but must be supported by institutions. Could Lewitzky have succeeded without the support of the Federal Theatre Project, or subsequent support from the NEA and NEH? How are California artists subsidizing their work today and what direct impact did Lewitzky's actions have on our present artistic environment?Bella Lewitzky died on July 16, 2004. At age 88, her physical health had deteriorated but her vital spirit continued to inspire those around her. Designated one of America's Irreplaceable Dance Treasures by the Dance Heritage Coalition and awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Clinton, Lewitzky's life demonstrates how a ""uniquely Californian"" artist with vision and tenacity can change the lives and landscapes of her fellow citizens for the better."

But learning to navigate and survive in a polar environment wasn't the only obstacle. This team skied the same icy terrain as the rarified community of predominantly white male polar explorers and scientists. At many points in the journey, their ""place at the table"" was in question. Representing the nations of Slovenia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, France, and the U.K., the team worked through profound differences in language, religion, communication and culture to achieve a singular, common goal. In the end, four team members, including Sheikha Asma Al Thani of Qatar, became the first ever from their nations to ski to the North Pole.Our first stop was the Arctic outpost of Longyearbyen on Norway's Svalbard Archipelago, the northernmost community in the world. There we waited for a Russian team to build Ice Station Barneo - an epic undertaking delayed nearly three weeks in the wake of two recent helicopter crashes that grounded all aviation. When go-time finally came, we flew to Barneo to fuel up, and then in a MI-8 helicopter that dropped us and our sledges, laden with hundreds of pounds of gear, at 2 AM, into -39°F temperatures at roughly 89 degrees North.

Naturally, the series touches upon the subject of ""society"" and where it's heading, but delves further into David's story, peeling back his layered upbringing and family background. His father was a chauffeur for ""Black Jack"" Bouvier, Jackie Kennedy's wild and womanizing paterfamilias. And it was at his parents' dinner table where conversations about the goings-on in the back seat of chauffeured limousines created rare moments of peace in an otherwise volatile household, sparking David's escapist interest in society. David's own family history is filled with drama, heart-breaking tragedy and great poignancy, making his a uniquely American story about social mobility, self-reliance and self re-invention - in short, of achieving one's dreams by dint of will, perseverance and personality. Notables featured in the series include Liz Smith, Charlotte and Anne Ford, Olivia Palermo, Patrick McMullan, Jill Kargman, Hilary Ross, Olivia Palermo, Geoffrey Bradfield, Susan Fales-Hill, Beth DeWoody, Nikki Haskell, Cornelia Guest, Gayfryd Steinberg, Carolyne Roehm, Muffie Potter Aston, and more.",

Experts like Wade Davis and Leila Salazar-Lopez speak about the impact trees/plants have on our atmosphere, including Carbon sequestration and providing Oxygen for us to breathe.

Director Statement :
KING OF KINGS takes an in-depth look at the life and legacy of Edward Jones. As his granddaughter, I've had access to countless anecdotes and incredible documents retracing his personal journey in the midst of major historical events. Even though it took me years to do all the research and interviews, as well as find the funds to finance the film, as a filmmaker, I could not have asked for a better story.Since I have been living most of my life in Europe, making this documentary was not only an amazing personal and professional experience, it also allowed me to plunge into the history of the United States. As Quincy Jones says in the film ""It is so important to know and understand your history, because if you know where you come from, it helps you get where you're going.""Discovering for instance that African Americans were behind the State Lottery and seeing the incredible impact my grandfather had on Chicago were just some of the many eye-opening facts that I came across. Seeing the amazing enthusiastic audience response to the film each time it is being screened in festivals makes all this journey worth it. Policy Kings will not fall after all into oblivion."

""Out of Dark"" takes you into the areas of our society never accessed before. As we speak, there is a whole other world happening around us without our knowledge. Every night when you lay your head down on the pillow, there are hundreds, if not thousands of domestic and foreign operatives lurking around our nation, not to mention around the world. Who are these people? Who do they work for? What are they up to? These questions are addressed. This program is so secretive, most high-level government officials don't even know about it. We better wake up and take note before it's too late. All identities are withheld to protect the not-so innocent. Great lengths were taken to insure this by utilizing voice changing technologies, highly encrypted media storage and more. This is not a pretty or Hollywood style film loaded with FX and action scenes intended for entertainment purposes. This acquired, raw and gritty footage is more informational since it was shot by an operative while on mission, not some elite cinematographer. In fact, anyone familiar with intelligence or surveillance work, knows that 99 percent of the time is waiting. Umbra, the code name used by the operative, revealed inside secrets of the program he was involved with in an effort to get out for good.",

Going by the pseudonym JAX, she has amassed millions of followers who hang on every word of her frequent, unhinged video blogs dedicated to exposing a powerful secret society known as THE PARLIAMENT. But her second shot at fame did not come without a cost-as Jax gained prominence and influence in the digital realm, Jackie's life in the real world crumbled around her. She alienated her friends and destroyed her marriage, leaving her alone, bitter, and paranoid.But finally, vindication arrives in the form of a global communications blackout. Jackie is certain the Parliament is responsible, but since the internet and phone lines have gone dark, she has no way of telling anyone how right she's been all along. Cut off from the online community she's grown so dependent on, Jackie becomes more isolated than ever. She starts drinking heavily to numb the pain, and begins recording progressively disturbing videos, sending them out into the ether in a desperate effort to break through the Parliament's blockade.As the days pass, Jackie's grip on reality becomes more and more tenuous. She feels like she's being watched. She hears noises she can't explain. And when she finds a mysterious box in her closet, she becomes convinced that she is now a target of the very organization she's been trying to expose. Feeling as though both her sanity and life are in danger, Jackie is sure she must solve the riddle of this strange box to save herself. But to do that, she must examine who and what she has become, and ask herself some hard questions...What is real? What is delusion?And does the difference even matter anymore?"

The early years of the band are filled with music, touring, ridiculous fashion and no small amount of booze. In short, it's all about an up-and-coming band willing to do anything (and we mean anything) to entertain. Footage from their insane live shows provides a vicarious thrill, helping to illuminate the phrase, ""You had to be there."" The band hits its peak during the Bloodsongs era (their most popular album), which would be financed by Patrick Carney, drummer for world-famous rock band The Black Keys. As Carney says in the film, ""A few of their shows were some of the funniest things I've ever seen happen in person. It was all pretty genius."" At the height of their success, we begin to see cracks in the band's foundation, a result of relentless touring done for little money and sparse acclaim. Finally, we witness the ""crash and burn"" phase, in which they release their final album and quickly run out of gas, both in financial and familial terms. We learn of two brothers driven in opposite directions by the hard reality of the music business. One, a mysterious figure. The other, a gregarious frontman, searching for a new life in Youngstown.

The independent not-for-profit film is produced by Electric Yolk Media and directed by award-winning filmmaker Amanda Kinsey. Through on-camera interviews, compelling footage, and historical photographs, the film tells a positive immigration story and highlights the dynamic contributions Jewish Americans made to shaping the Western United States. The film premiered at the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival in early 2022 and is currently streaming on Amazon and broadcasting on public television stations nationwide.—Amanda Kinsey","The film may have been silent, but the impact was that of a loud bang. ""The Great Train Robbery,"" known as the first American Western, would prove to be one of the most influential films in cinema. The year was 1903 and tales of the Wild West were quickly spreading throughout the world. In the film, Broncho Billy Anderson plays four roles. He is considered the first film celebrity cowboy and became so iconic that he was immortalized on a US stamp, has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and is honored in the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma. Fun fact? Broncho Bill was actually named Max Aronson and the son of Jewish immigrants.Western Jewish pioneers, those of the silver screen and real life, are a largely forgotten chapter in US History. And yet, they played a definitive role shaping the expansion of the United States. There were nationally known names such as Levi Strauss, Samsonite founder Jesse Shwayder and the Guggenheim family, who built their great success through grit and determination in California and Colorado. A young Golda Meir spent formative years in Denver. And there were also lesser-known characters such as Solomon Bibo, a Prussian immigrant, who became a non-Native American tribal leader in New Mexico and Solomon Carvalho, a Sephardic painter and photographer who spent the mid-1800s documenting the territories of Kansas, Colorado and Utah. Wyatt Earp's wife, Josephine Marcus Earp, was a Jewish actress whose beauty is rumored to have triggered the fight at the OK Corral. And by the end of the 19th Century nearly every notorious Wild West town had a Jewish mayor.The wagon trains that moved westward with Jewish families traveled for the same reason as many settlers: opportunity. Continuous cycles of anti-Jewish oppression, deadly violence and forced poverty in Europe pushed over two million Jewish refugees to seek out a better life in America. The antisemitism and tenements found in New York City, however, did not offer the respite many were seeking. By 1912, it is estimated over 100,000 Jewish immigrants had moved to the Wild West. They put down roots and, today, they epitomize the important legacy of immigration in America."

At 37, a debilitating, chronic illness she has had for more than 20 years has begun to take its toll. As Marieke's strength falters and her body begins to fail, she decides to take control by signing papers to die by euthanasia, the controversial procedure of medically-assisted death.
Liberated and empowered by now having the legal permission to die, Marieke again discovers the freedom and thrill of living and of competition. Recovering her sense of self-determination, over the next decade, Marieke postpones her decision to die. Through sheer willpower and strength of character, she qualifies for the Paralympics and wins Gold in wheelchair-racing in the Paralympic Games and World Championships.
Even as her health deteriorates, her spirit soars.

Throughout, Marieke draws people to her: fans, girlfriends, celebrities, and other people with disabilities.

The documentary features raw and honest audio recordings made by Capers in the battlefield, including recently declassified film and photographs that transport the viewer deep into the heart of a faithful warrior, through once classified or top secret missions.",

""You have 60 seconds to kill the person in front of you. If you fail to complete this task then both participants will be terminated. To encourage you to continue fighting you will be administered electric shocks. Are you ready? Let's begin. 60 Seconds""—Rachel Star Withers","A twisted soon-to-be serial killer decides to recreate his own version of the Hofling Hospital Experiment.In 1966, psychiatrist Charles K. Hofling conducted an experiment on obedience. At a hospital, 22 nurses were ordered by an unknown, unseen doctor to administer a dangerous dose of a drug to their patients. Even though the nurses were aware the official guidelines forbid the administration of the drug. Of the 22 nurses involved in the experiment, 21 decided to administer the lethal dose, never questioning the unknown authority figure.How far will a person go because an authority figure tells them?
Objective one of two
Objective one: Human ObedienceThe experiment starts.
Round 1: Ten people lay unconscious in different decaying rooms, two people in a room. Each is wearing a bar gag in their mouth which connects to a shock collar around their neck. The killer assigns each fighter a different pseudonym (COP, NURSE, HIPSTER) reducing them to a single stereotype. Cameras record from the corner of every room. The five feeds are streaming live to the internet. Abruptly everyone receives an electric shock, violently waking them.An upbeat computerized voice speaks:
""Welcome. We are excited to have you here. When the buzzer rings you will have precisely 60 seconds to kill the person in front of you."" *Participants look to their opponent -some size the each other up, while others desperately look around for an escape. ""If you fail to complete this task both participants will be terminated. To encourage you to continue fighting you will be administered warning shocks. For Example."" *All participants receive an electric shock, throwing them into convulsions. ""Are you ready? Let's begin. 60 seconds."" *Buzzer sounds.NURSE versus GOLD DIGGER. GOLD DIGGER slams NURSE into the wall repeatedly. NURSE knowing she can't take another hit uses the ridge of her hand to chop into GOLD DIGGER's neck. GOLD DIGGER struggles to breathe choking to death on her own blood.
COP versus METH HEAD. COP tries to figure out how to control the situation but METH HEAD wildly charges at him. COP leaps out of the way as METH HEAD cracks his skull into the wall.
LAWYER versus PRISON. Neither hesitates and immediately starts fighting. PRISON chokes LAWYER with his handcuffs but LAWYER slips out of his grasp. LAWYER grabs PRISON's face and smashes it in with his knee.
GANG versus COLLEGE. COLLEGE freaks out screaming and swats at GANG. She attempts to run away but GANG catches her. Gripping COLLEGE's ponytail GANG bashes her head into a sink. He lets her lifeless body fall to the ground.
HIPSTER versus SCHIZO. HIPSTER hurls punches wildly at SCHIZO, but she manages to dodge HIPSTER's flailing arms. As HIPSTER tries to grab SCHIZO, she trips him head first into a water heater. HIPSTER collapses to the floor with a broken neck.
All participants receive another electric shock and drop to the ground unconscious.Rounds 2 and 3: take place with NURSE, COP, LAWYER, GANG, and SCHIZO continuing to win against different opponents. Videos of the fights start to go viral across the internet causing a host of people to create commentary and reaction videos. Many wonder how they can be chosen to be in #shockfight, make fun of the fighters, and post excitement to watch the next round. YouTuber, GIRL IN THE KNOW, becomes obsessed with GANG. She posts videos after each round gushing over him. Internet show, MMA Beat Down, has hosts DUKE and professional bare-knuckle boxer TAYLOR ""KILLA BEE"" STARLING recap the fights and discuss the fighters' performance.Round 4: COP, GANG, and SCHIZO have new opponents but NURSE and LAWYER are facing each other. LAWYER reaches for NURSE lovingly, their hands connect revealing matching wedding bands. LAWYER grabs a knife and slits his own throat sacrificing himself for her.Round 5: COP and SCHIZO face new opponents however GANG is fighting NURSE. NURSE distraught over losing her husband does not fight back. GANG plays with her as a cat would with a mouse. Using the same knife as her husband, GANG viciously stabs NURSE in the face. Streamers of the fight videos have mixed reviews, some happy NURSE was taken out, others upset by her savage demise.Round 6: SCHIZO takes on new opponent REDNECK. REDNECK throws SCHIZO around like a rag doll snapping her spine. As REDNECK drags her along the ground SCHIZO grasps two bricks and smashes REDNECK's head between them. His body topples over while SCHIZO screams out in pain unable to stand up. COP and GANG wake up together on a deserted dirt road. They charge at each other and a ruthless fight unfolds. Both have blood pouring from them as GANG desperately gouges COP's eyes, blinding him. COP reaching along the ground manages to grab GANG. COP proceeds to beat GANG's face with a brick. Streamers watching the two fights struggle to process the brutality of this round. It is no longer fun. Only COP and SCHIZO remain.Round 7: COP and SCHIZO awake in a desolate room. COP is blind and SCHIZO lays unable to move with her body contorted. COP reaches out and feels for an opponent, finding SCHIZO he pulls her into his arms in a protective embrace. Both, unable to fight, silently decide to let time run out and die together. The voice counts down the remaining seconds. ""FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE"" - both receive an extra-long electric shock throwing them into convulsions. Then everything stops. The voice speaks: ""Experiment Terminated."" COP and SCHIZO slowly let out a breath, both releasing all of their emotions that have been building through the entire ordeal. The experiment is finally over for them. However, people streaming the fights are unhappy with that ending. One streamer questions, ""You mean they could have just stopped fighting this entire time, chosen not to fight and it would be over? Then why are we watching this?""The Killer lists his results.
Objective one: Human Obedience
Seven rounds took place before a challenge to authority.
Objective two: Human Apathy
No observers tried to stop the fights, the rounds could have continued indefinitely.The Bystander Effect is a phenomenon that as the number of witnesses or bystanders increases, so does the time it takes for individuals to respond to an emergency.

Through the interwoven and diverse stories of the men in the film, we hope to subtly address some of the most pressing questions of our time. Namely: What is prison for? Who and why does it affect certain communities? How can we make it more humane? What kind of reforms are needed? And what does rehabilitation even mean?""Coldwater Kitchen"" opens in the early morning dusk, a solitary figure departing his modest apartment for his commute to work - a roundtrip drive of 134 miles. The destination is Lakeland Correctional Facility, and the man behind the wheel is Chef Jimmy Lee Hill.For three decades at this men's prison in Coldwater, Mich., Chef Hill has run a gourmet culinary training program with a mix of compassion and humanity uncommon in the criminal justice system. This is a man who doesn't even look at the files of the students who enter his program, though he knows some of them have been convicted of violent crimes.Inside the prison, we meet Bradley Leonard, a fast-talking Sicilian-American cook who worked in high-end kitchens in Detroit and New York City while simultaneously battling a raging heroin addiction - a habit not easily kicked in a system not designed to deal with people struggling with drug problems.Then there is Ernest Davis, a gentle man with a quick smile and big dreams who's been in Chef Hill's culinary program for 20-some years. At 17, Ernest was sentenced to natural life for his role in a drug robbery gone wrong, ending in felony murder. Thanks to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Ernest comes up for resentencing.And finally, Dink Dawson, another one of Chef's star pupils who always had an interest in cooking but no real training until prison, is finishing up a seven-year stint for dealing drugs with hopes for a culinary career on the outside.Chef Hill is the binding agent that links all these men - and not just as their culinary instructor. He's also a mentor, a father figure, a spiritual leader and a therapist. A divorcee in his 60s, Chef Hill's own sense of purpose is so deeply intertwined with that of ""his guys"" that we're left to wonder what he would do without them. As he approaches 30 years at Lakeland, questions abound about his inevitable retirement - and what that might mean for the future of the life-changing program he's been so instrumental in stewarding."

Passengers by the thousands reached the island by way of two sister steamships, SS Columbia and Ste Claire. In 1993 Boblo Island tragically shut down, and the boats were left to ruin. Mirroring Detroit's decline and resurgence, two teams of people doggedly attempt the restoration of these iconic vessels as the city stands in the midst of a grass roots renaissance.SS Columbia is presently owned by a New York-based nonprofit endowed with grants and employing experienced nautical preservationists. They are resurrecting Columbia into a traveling museum and event space in Buffalo, leaving Ste. Claire as Detroit's last vestige of Boblo Island. Claire's fate rests in the hands of an unlikely band of heroes: a doctor, a psychic, and an amusement park fanatic.The documentary walks an aesthetic and narrative tightrope, accommodating rosy memories of Boblo Island without neglecting the whitewashed history of segregation in America's early amusement parks. The film pays homage to the forgotten civil rights hero Sarah E. Ray who forced the integration of Boblo Island in 1945. Although her story has previously been omitted from Detroit history, it was part of the NAACP's road to the seminal Brown v. Board of Education decision, which ended the separate but equal doctrine in 1954. Due to the filmmakers' efforts, her former home was recently chosen by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of the '11 Most Endangered' Historic sites in America. The film also unearths the buried tale of Sugar Island, a former amusement park directly neighboring Boblo Island. It was purchased in 1945 by African Americans to be a ""park for their own race"" in retaliation against Boblo's segregationist policies."

In this tribute to folks who grew up in the punk, riot grrrl, and indie music scenes, Breaux, StormMiguel Florez, J Aguilar, Dakota Billops-Breaux, and Sarah Korda make up the cast with cameos from punk and local icons Lynn Breedlove, Allison Wolfe, Hilary Ronen, and Per Sia in this spirited local comedy.",

3. Against all odds, this small GA town steel company takes us step by step through the heart and soul of the turbulent creation of The ARC.
4. Can The ARC sustain transportation out of a GA warehouse over small town roads leading to a river with promise to a destination at sea?
5. What obstacles does this family run steel business encounter over two decades.
6. They risk everything with determination and vision. There is no turning back.
7. How can the team move a 50 foot steel boat out of an enclosed family run warehouse?
8. What type of structure can withstand the weight of this boat to transport along the back roads and mountains towards Knoxville?
9. Can small country roads/bridges accommodate this massive ARC?
10. Watch this true story of amazing ""first ever"" creative engineering and planning of The ARC.

Today, it's a different story-and the stakes couldn't be higher for Jimmy Lai, the citizens of Hong Kong, and the people of China. Jimmy fled Maoist revolutionaries as a 12 year old and began a new life as a simple textile laborer in Hong Kong.

Instead of mixed drinks, fine cuisine and laughter, every couples intimate details of their relationships are awkwardly exposed through a twisted turn of unexpected events. No one is amused, realizing that This is Life.Gerald (40s) and Kacey (40s) marriage may appear to be boring and routine; but they are intentional about keeping their honeymoon phase alive and getting to the bag. Agreeing to disagree is their love language. Gerald has maintained his younger athletic physique and is is a family man, a man of his word and committed to being an example in his community. Kacey has had a gigantic personality since childhood and is nothing short of a handful; she loves her family, friends and more than anything, a great business venture. Just ask her little sister Meghan (late 30s) and she will tell you. Meghan is a successful tax attorney by day and the life of any party at night. Meg can be a bit sensitive when it comes to receiving what she dishes out, but no one will ever know it because she will never let anyone see her sweat, not even Chris. Chris, (40s) is Meghan's ex-husband and current entanglement. Chris and Meg have recently divorced, but now somehow have found their way back to one another. The couple is known for their pettiness and are always attempting to one up on each other.

Unfortunately, for Chase, Meghan is watching the doorbell camera. She is not happy. When Meg greets Chase at the door, she makes it clear that tasting her drink was highly inappropriate by whooping the teen with anything she can put her hands on. Since Kacey and DeAnne agree that delivering food doesn't justify sampling it, they decide to scare Chase by acting insane and telling him that he is inside a mental institution. An already lit Chase passes out from shock. After the men become aware of the ladies' childish antics, all of the friends wake the teen up only to discover that Chase has a close connection to Kacey and Gerald's business investor's, Todd and Laurie Jamison.

He carries himself through the world like a celebrity, despite having no real claim to fame beyond his affable personality.

So, he enlists his close friend, filmmaker Bradley Berman, to document his life story-before it's too late and his memory and capacity for language retreat forever.Inspired by similar personal documentary essays, this film reveals universal truths about mortality, as well as the range of available options for how to approach the inevitable.JACK HAS A PLAN is a compelling personal movie that explores the nature of love and friendship.

Deeply misunderstood and widely misrepresented, during his decades-long career as a film director (1958-2009), Rollin's work received absolutely no recognition in his native country of France, and was completely unknown anywhere else. In the nineties, because of home video, Rollin attained a marginal cult status in niche English speaking genre circles. Otherwise he has remained completely obscure. Rollin was raised within the bosom of some of France's most influential and intellectual elites, thanks to his mother Denise's friendship with figures such as Maurice Blanchot, George Bataille, Jean Cocteau, as well as Jacques and Pierre Prévert.Similarly his father was a director in avant garde theatre, exposing Jean to some of France's most interesting aspects of culture. It is perhaps not surprising that when it came to making his films, Jean Rollin's were unlike anything else on the scene. Once you dig into the director's life and passions, what emerges is a strong connection to the French surrealists, to symbolist art, to the poetry of TristanCorbière, to the French anarchist scene in the sixties, and counterculture. Orchestrator of Storms: The Fantastique World of Jean Rollin sets out to tell this story in an attempt to elevate the director's work by exploring it in depth alongside these major influences, as well as other key themes such as the tradition of the French Fantastique. The film also looks at his frustrations, the way in which he had to constantly grapple and scramble for funding as one of the only filmmakers predominantly working within the horror genre through the sixties and seventies. Most importantly, it examines his singular vision, one that ran completely counter to other western traditions in genre film. The project began life on more modest terms, but after working very closely with Jean's family, including his surviving son Serge, and close family friend Véronique D-Travers, it became apparent there was a far deeper and richer story to tell. A story of struggle that led to the filmmaker falling into poverty and ill health in his later years, one in which he was never understood or given the credit he was due during his own lifetime, where he was forced to constantly battle to make the films he wanted to make. Filmmakers Dima Ballin and Kat Ellinger hope to change that in presenting Jean's story as never seen before, with the help of some of his key collaborators, close friends, and experts in both film and cultural history, as well as those responsible for ensuring his work never completely fell out of sight.",

Jon walks into his miserable job where customers are eating and employees are working. Jon walks to the break room to try to put his bowtie on but then is surprised by his co-worker Deja. Deja teases him about his tie and helps him with it. Deja tells Jon about a party she's throwing that night and ask him to come, Jon nervously says he will think about it.
Jon walks out of the break room to the dining hall where he runs into his strict manager Lena. Lena tells him to change his shoes because it's not a part of the dress code. They argue for a bit until she ends by threatening to send him home. Lena walks to the break room to change.
Jon ignores Lena and asks for Deja's for one of her tables to wait on, she accepts but Jon owes her. Jon takes the order of two guys waiting at one of the tables, this makes Lena furious as she sees him in the dining hall.

As Jon takes a puff, the background turns pitch black. The only light around him is the lit tip of the blunt. He begins to relax and then enters some sort of trance, and explodes into a feeling of euphoria as smoke fills the room. A dopey but relaxing smile forms on Jon's face. Jon's eyes are getting really red and all of a sudden he's focused because AJ is asking for the blunt back. Jon is then snapped back into reality as AJ begins snapping his fingers in Jon's face to get him out of his trance.AJ takes a hit then turns out on a trippy music video (Audego- ""Sleepy"") for him and Jon to watch.

The organization hosted world-famous jazz musicians and poets at its highly sought-after performance venue, and it served as an epicenter for political contemporaries such as the Black Panther Party, the Young Lords and the Congress of Afrikan People, as well as comrades across Africa and the Caribbean. In effect, The East built an independent Black nation in the heart of Central Brooklyn. The Sun Rises in The East is the first feature-length documentary to explore The East and its continued influence on the fabric of Black Brooklyn.

As Covid has forced our kids to rely on technology more than ever, ""#KidsOnTech"" looks at the impact on children's developing bodies and brains, and asks: ""How might we better prepare our kids for this digital world?"" Voices from India to the U.S., France to China, Mexico to Japan explore what children need to truly excel in a future dominated by tech, including a Google designer, a German brain scientist, and New York Times journalist, Matt Richtel, whose story on a Silicon Valley school created an international media frenzy.
Is tech somehow inherently evil? Should we shield our children from tech at all costs? Certainly not, nor could we if we tried. #KidsOnTech's approach is one of empathic concern for all who are caught up in tech's blinding advance and offers parents a reminder of basic child development and how we can better foster our children's growth and maturity so that they might thrive, not only in tech environments, but in the world itself.
Most of us were relieved to have zoom classrooms, but children around the world are now emerging even more obsessed than before with tech devices. The growing consensus in scientific circles confers that heavy use of tech can profoundly compromise healthy ""brain development"" in young children. And yet, in the world today, it is nearly impossible for parents and children not to depend on these devices in multiple ways. What to do?
During the editing of the film, everyone wanted us to offer a simple answer; but there were none. Nonetheless, parents and teachers are desperate for answers. Our mission in this film is to step beyond the hyperbolic media coverage spelling doom and gloom for kids and ask: What are we missing in this polarized debate? Our process was to seek out intimate conversations with parents, teachers, neuroscientists, tech executives, child psychologists, and kids of every age from around the world hoping to better understand what's become humankind's greatest social experiment.
This film's objective is to help start these important conversations with parents and teachers - conversations that are as important and alive today as climate change. The film tries to remind parents of what they already know - instinctively, as parents - children need to experience outdoor play, work with their hands, engage with their friends, and figure out what to do when they become insufferably bored. The film explores how we might both protect and prepare our children for a rapidly changing world where turning back the clock is not an option. Even so, the jury is still out whether tech is helping our children grow into healthier, more creative and technically proficient adults; or, paradoxically, hindering the very capacities they'll need to navigate an evermore technologically demanding future."

This is not a documentary about Gordon Lightfoot; rather, it is a heartwarming film highlighting the magic of the road, and focuses on a family that was baptized and raised on Lightfoot's music. It captures that elusive, somewhat undefinable element that makes our lives inextricably intertwined with songs and ultimately, makes us all fans in the end. The movie is filmed through enchanting urban and countryside views of the United Kingdom and Ireland, where Gordon Lightfoot and his band returned to tour for the first time in over 30 years. It features charming small-town Orillia, Lightfoot's hometown, and travels to Toronto, Lightfoot's adopted hometown where he has been based throughout most of his career, and in the U.S., Germany, and Israel, where the people who were touched by his beautiful work live and act.—Baylee Kahlon",

This 'Artistic and Musical Documentary' is unique and a work of art in itself, inspired by the art of the artist it portrays.Willard Snow received his master art degree from a prestigious college in San Francisco which he equates to a Phd in art. After commenting about many years of trying different approaches to life and his vision with many different jobs doing graphic art for companies, clients and websites, Willard decides to move forward in his career by dropping all side activities and focusing solely on his original style art. He begins by painting Rock Star portraits and several giant guitar sculptures provided to him by The Gibson Foundation in an original, unique style all his own.With no more income from his regular jobs, Willard ventures into the unknown by securing a temporary free studio to work in.

Soon Willard finds himself in the middle of a big dilemma: try to keep it together or bail out.A temporary new location for an art show is secured by Willard and John Felix, Willards friend and gallery manager. They collaborate with Vintage 47 amps store, which makes custom guitar amps that sound just like the classic original guitar amps of the 1960's. The owners of the store agree to host an Art Gala party featuring Willard's art and the music of many musicians they know. The show is a high point in the story as the musicians show up to perform original harmonica jams, slide guitar, original songs and to party.

With a lack of school libraries, classroom libraries, books within the community, bookstores, robust marketing by the NYPL in The Bronx and decades of divestment to education, a literacy crisis has come to fruition in The Bronx. Born from the stereotypes that people in The Bronx do not read and are only known for having interests in sneaker and liquor stores; it is not by coincidence that access to literature has a profound effect on the culture of reading. As of 2016, only 56% of high school graduates in The Bronx are college ready. Poverty is a major factor, with 40% of children in the South Bronx living below the poverty line. A child raised in poverty is 13 times less likely to finish high school on time, if at all. 70 percent of third grade students in The South Bronx are unable to read at their grade level. The New York City Department of Education has found that children who fail to meet the third grade benchmark are more likely to drop out of high school and remain in poverty.

She is put through the ultimate test when a series of tragic events occur and she becomes obligated to take a job as an in-home caregiver for Millicent, an elderly White woman with dementia and ties to the Confederate States of America.At the start of her employment, Cheyanne is instructed to give Millicent an experimental drug that is meant to improve her memory and is warned against administering too much of the medicine at one time. What starts off as an easy job quickly becomes a nightmare after Millicent ingests several pills at once.With her memory slightly improving, Millicent begins to remember that she was once given the responsibility of hiding and protecting a cache of Confederate gold that seems to be missing. When Cheyanne comes across something that appears to be a treasure map, she begins to suspect Millicent's former caregiver of finding the buried treasure and abandoning Millicent. However, Millicent becomes violent towards Cheyanne which puts the caregiver in the position of having to protect herself without resorting to anger or elder abuse.A surprise visit from her boyfriend, Justin, helps Cheyanne take her mind off of things when he comes to spend the night with her. The next day, Justin is pulled over by two police detectives who suspect him of committing a murder and, when the detectives search his car, they find a dead body in the trunk and arrest him.Later that night, it becomes evident that Millicent is in full possession of her faculties when she begins to terrorize Cheyanne. Realizing that she is in imminent danger, Cheyanne manages to signal for help and is eventually saved by the two detectives that arrested Justin.In the end, the whereabouts of Millicent's former caregiver become known and Justin is released from jail when it is proven that he was not guilty of committing murder. Cheyanne comes to realize that there was no way that Millicent's former caregiver could have ever been in possession of the missing treasure and so the question remains: What happened to the hidden caches of Confederate gold?"
