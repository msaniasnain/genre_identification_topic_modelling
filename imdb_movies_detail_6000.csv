In so doing, it has engendered a never seen before struggle for power to every corner of the world.

During the next 20 years, Ilaria overcomes many obstacles as a pioneering woman entrepreneur developing weight-training and fitness workouts based on martial arts. She is one of the first women to bring strength training and martial arts to gyms in the U.S.
In 2016, Ilaria, then an internationally recognized fitness expert at the peak of her career, was diagnosed with breast cancer. For an athlete of her magnitude, it was devastating. Shortly after her struggle, Ilaria learns of her father's diagnosis of terminal cancer.
Stronger for Life documents Ilaria's fight against cancer and how she embodied her own philosophy: Exercise makes you stronger for life, to overcome the heartache and challenges she encounters.
This documentary follows Ilaria every step of the way for three years from diagnosis and surgery to treatment and recovery. We see her in the hospital before her surgery and post-surgery as she makes difficult decisions regarding treatment.
Our cameras capture her on film in the gym as she slowly struggles to regain her original level of strength despite being told by her physicians that she would never be able to physically perform her signature classes as before. Not long after her own battle with breast cancer, Ilaria receives wrenching news of her father's diagnosis of terminal lung cancer and returns to Florence several times for her last visits with him. The film features interviews and intimate family scenes, Ilaria's mother's stay in New York to help and support her, the surgeon who operated on her and a few of the many students who have been inspired by Ilaria's training and philosophy to confront challenges of their own.
In 2017, Ilaria was honored with the first Lifetime Achievement Award ever given to an Equinox instructor, and in 2019 in an Equinox survey, Ilaria was acknowledged as the fitness instructor who had the greatest class attendance worldwide in the more than 100 gyms owned by Equinox. Adapting to the global crisis of the pandemic, Ilaria continues to teach and has developed a widely followed virtual presence, successfully converting her bricks and mortar classes into a digital form. She continues to follow her passion and spread her philosophy world-wide that exercise makes you stronger for life.
In these uncertain times, exercise and fitness is more important than ever to support the immune system and combat the effects, both physical and psychological, of the pandemic."

By the time the area's first internet cafe, Cyber City, opens in the mid-1990s, the scene begins to stretch thin.As the end of the 1990s approaches, KUNV's student-focused programming is eliminated to make more airtime for jazz programs, which impacts the ability of local record stores like Benway Bop! to thrive. An art scene starts developing in downtown Las Vegas, pulling bodies and business away from Maryland Parkway. Over the course of a few years, most of the record stores, galleries and coffee shops close, save for Cafe Espresso Roma, which finally shuts its doors in 2003.Although parts of Maryland Parkway become neglected and attract unhoused populations, in contemporary times, university-spawned housing and mixed-use projects attract new business and offer an opportunity for a brighter future for the area."

Over three days, they will face 6 harrowing ""tests"" and crown their World Champions in the Women's, Men's, and Teams divisions. Each of the 6 tests challenges a different aspect of fitness: Endurance, Strength, Bodyweight, Skill, Mixed, and Power.
The USA Functional Fitness Team are here for redemption after dominating at home in 2017 and facing disappointment in London in 2018. Coach Justin Cotler plans to stage a comeback and sweep the podium in 2019.
Canada's Alex Parker is here on a personal quest to defeat her ""frenemy"" and rival, American Jordan Adcock, who lives in the same town, trains at the same gym, and shares the same coach. They're neck and neck in every test.
The sport of Functional Fitness wants to be an Olympic sport. These 46 National Federations around the globe have banded together in order to ""Reach for the Rings"" and achieve their Olympic dream.
Day 1 is the Endurance test and the Strength test. In the Endurance test, individuals compete on 5 rounds of air runner, ski erg, and double-unders. The Teams Endurance test is a cross-country relay race. The Strength test involves heavy barbell lifts in all categories: Overhead Squats for individuals, along with Snatches and Shoulder-to-Overhead for the teams.
Day 2 is the Bodyweight test and the Skill test. Bodyweight for both the individuals and teams categories involve a high volume of handstand push-ups and rope climbs. The Skill test is more challenging, with Kettlebell get-ups, parallel bar complexes, and controlled handstand walks.
Day 3 is the Mixed test and the Power test. The Mixed test combines all the elements of the previous tests: endurance, strength, and bodyweight exercises. The Power test is a short, fast, hard, and intense race through a mixed fitness challenge.
In the end, the first place Woman, Man, and Team get gold medals, while the second place in each category gets the silver medals, and third place takes bronze."

We follow the evolution of laser entertainment: Ivan Dryer and the rise and fall of Laserium over 50 years, the first laser show that started in Los Angeles and conquered cities all over the world. 20 million people saw a Laserium show, 40 million still want to see one, over 100 million people are looking at laser entertainment every day today.In the early 70's filmmaker and amateur astronomer Ivan Dryer saw a laser art experiment at USC by Dr. Elsa Garmire. He then had a vision to create a laser show performed live to music. They hosted their first live ""cosmic laser concert"" in 1973 inside the planetarium at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, California and the rest is history. It was a show and technology like no one had ever seen before.We visit Dr. Elsa Garmire, the first lady of lasers, and she shows us what she showed Ivan back in 1970s - that's what started it all. The artistic venture launched a new form of entertainment and a 70's trend they coined as Laserium. They created a show for Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side Of The Moon' and countless others for the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rush, U2 and more - these shows played at the Griffith Observatory for 28 years, which is the longest running theatrical attraction in the history of Los Angeles. They toured with some of the biggest artists in the music industry such as Alice Cooper, Tangerine Dream, and Rush. In more than four decades, they created laser effects for studio movies, television shows, commercials, live events and choreographed shows for planetariums around the world. More than 20 million people have experienced a Laserium show.We meet the people running the ""live"" shows, the ""Laserist"". They are live artists performing on a unique piece of equipment, a ""light-synthesizer"", developed by Ivan and his team. We get to visit the lab and see how it works behind the scenes.Ultimately we get to experience the ""very last"" Laserium show, when the last original location in LA closes. Now Laserium lives on - in every laser show produced, from EDC to all over the world.ILDA (International Laser Display Association) honored producer/director Bjorn Schaller with a rare ""ILDA Special Achievement Award"" in November 2020.From the citation: "" 'Laserium - The Gods of Light' was screened for a closed, private audience of ILDA members. Many who had lived through the events were misty-eyed at seeing their passion finally captured on film. It is an artistic and technical achievement, that covers the evolution of a unique art form by following the pioneering company whose name is synonymous with laser light shows."""

Despite many achievements, repeated insubordination has kept him from flag rank; his friend and former Top Gun rival, Admiral Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky, now commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, often protects Maverick. Rear Admiral Chester ""Hammer"" Cain plans to cancel Maverick's hypersonic ""Darkstar"" scramjet program in favor of funding drones. To save the program, Maverick unilaterally changes the target speed for that day's test from Mach 9 to the final contract specification of Mach 10. However, the prototype is destroyed when he cannot resist pushing beyond Mach 10. Iceman again saves Maverick's career by assigning him to the Top Gun school at NAS North Island for his next assignment, but Cain tells Maverick that the era of crewed fighter aircraft will soon be over.The Navy has been tasked with destroying an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant, located in an underground bunker at the end of a canyon, before it becomes operational. It is defended by surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), GPS jammers, and fifth-generation Su-57 fighters as well as older F-14 Tomcats. Maverick devises a plan employing two pairs of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets armed with laser-guided bombs, but instead of participating in the strike, he is to train an elite group of Top Gun graduates assembled by Air Boss Vice Admiral Beau ""Cyclone"" Simpson.Maverick dogfights his skeptical students and prevails in every contest, winning their respect. Lieutenants Jake ""Hangman"" Seresin and Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw-son of Maverick's dead best friend and RIO Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw-clash: Rooster dislikes Hangman's cavalier attitude, while Hangman criticizes Rooster's cautious flying. Maverick reunites with former girlfriend Penny Benjamin, to whom he reveals that he promised Rooster's dying mother that Rooster would not become a pilot. Rooster, unaware of the promise, angrily resents Maverick for dropping his Naval Academy application-impeding his military career-and blames him for his father's death. Maverick is reluctant to further interfere with Rooster's career, but the alternative is to send him on the extremely dangerous mission. He tells his doubts to Iceman, who has terminal throat cancer. Iceman advises that ""It's time to let go"" and reassures him that both the Navy and Rooster need Maverick.After Iceman dies, Cyclone removes Maverick as instructor following a training incident in which an F/A-18F is lost. Cyclone relaxes the mission parameters, so they are easier to execute but make escape much more difficult. During Cyclone's announcement, Maverick makes an unauthorized flight through the course with his preferred parameters, proving that it can be done. Cyclone reluctantly appoints Maverick as team leader.Maverick flies the lead F/A-18E, accompanied by a buddy lazing F/A-18F[c] flown by Lieutenant Natasha ""Phoenix"" Trace and WSO Lieutenant Robert ""Bob"" Floyd. Rooster leads the second strike pair, which includes Lieutenant Reuben ""Payback"" Fitch and WSO Lieutenant Mickey ""Fanboy"" Garcia. The four jets launch from an aircraft carrier, and Tomahawk cruise missiles destroy the nearby air base as they approach. The teams destroy the plant, but the SAMs open fire during their escape, as anticipated. Rooster runs out of countermeasures, and Maverick sacrifices his plane to protect him. Believing Maverick to be dead, the others are ordered back to the carrier, but Rooster returns to find that Maverick ejected and is being targeted by an Mi-24 attack helicopter. After destroying the gunship, Rooster is shot down by a SAM and ejects. The two rendezvous and steal an F-14 from the damaged air base. Maverick and Rooster destroy two intercepting Su-57s, but a third attacks as they run out of ammunition and countermeasures. Hangman arrives in time to shoot it down, and the planes return safely.Later, Rooster helps Maverick work on his P-51 Mustang. Rooster looks at a photo of their mission's success, pinned alongside a photo of his late father and a young Maverick, as Penny and Maverick fly off in the P-51."

He is introduced to the new intern, Dylan, on whom he plays a prank at the start of his shift. Elvis runs his radio show with Mary, his switchboard operator. After being on the air for a while, Elvis receives a call from a man named Gary, who claims to be at his house and holding his wife and daughter, Olivia and Adria, hostage. When Elvis threatens to take Gary off the air, Gary says he will kill Elvis's family.Gary proceeds to explain that Elvis was responsible for a previous switchboard operator, Lauren, taking her own life due to Elvis's attitude and crude jokes towards her. Gary gets Elvis to admit on the air that he has slept with Mary. He then tells him to go up on the roof and jump. Dylan, Mary, and studio worker Steven follow. Dylan tries to trick Gary into believing that Elvis has jumped off the roof, but a drone outside is recording everything. Elvis then hears two gunshots go off and assumes his family is dead.On his way out of the studio, Gary's voice comes over the speakers and says that his family is still alive and somewhere in the building with him. Elvis then realizes that Gary has been in the studio the whole time and sent him on a wild goose chase so he would have time to kill the security guard at the front, hide in the building, and rig the whole place to explode. Gary says that Elvis has 40 minutes to find him before everyone dies. Elvis and Dylan make their way through the building and try to find Gary, Olivia, and Adria. Along the way, they run into Tony, an old friend of Elvis who has been secretly stealing computers from the building. Gary orders Elvis to kill him, but he lets him go, and they move on.When they are led to a false hiding place, Gary reveals that he can see them through the security cameras. Elvis leads Dylan, via a route without security cameras, to the control room where they find not Gary but Justin - a host with the time slot that Elvis wants - with a bullet in his head. Gary then reveals that he is now in the recording studio with a restrained Mary and Steven. After successfully earning ten more minutes on the clock, Elvis and Dylan make their way back to the studio via another secret route. When they reach upstairs, they see Tony hanging by the neck in the hallway.Elvis is able to apprehend Gary with a box cutter, but Gary reveals that he is holding a dead man's switch and that Olivia and Adria are on the terrace with bomb vests strapped to their bodies. Gary then receives a call from Bruce, a member of the LAPD SWAT team, who says he is on the terrace and unable to disarm the devices. Gary then demands a trade: Olivia and Adria go free, and Dylan takes their place.Forced to comply, Bruce deactivates the vests with Gary's help and brings them down to the studio, reactivating them on Dylan. Gary then shoots Bruce in the head and drops the dead man's switch as everyone looks on in horror only to have nothing happen.Elvis and Gary then burst out laughing and embracing as everyone thought to be dead re-emerges, alive and well. It is then revealed that the whole situation was a prank played by the whole studio on Dylan, who is shocked and horrified. After Elvis explains everything, he tries to get a reaction from Dylan, who leaves in silence.

Billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante Batman, investigates alongside the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). Lieutenant James Gordon discovers that the Riddler left a message for Batman, but commissioner Pete Savage berates him for allowing a vigilante to enter the crime scene and forces Batman to leave. The Riddler kills Savage and leaves another message for Batman.Batman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a thumb drive in Mitchell's car containing images of Mitchell with a woman, Annika, at the Iceberg Lounge, a nightclub operated by mobster Carmine Falcone's lieutenant Penguin. Batman questions the Penguin, who pleads ignorance, but notices that Selina Kyle, Annika's roommate and girlfriend, works there as a waitress. After Annika disappears, Batman sends Selina back to the Iceberg Lounge to search for answers. Through Selina, Batman discovers that Savage was on Falcone's payroll, as is district attorney Gil Colson. Selina shuts off communication when Batman presses her about her relationship with Falcone.The Riddler abducts Colson, straps a timed collar bomb to his neck, and sends him to interrupt Mitchell's funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler calls him via Colson's phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot answer three riddles. Batman helps Colson answer the first two, but Colson refuses to answer the third: name of the informant who gave the GCPD information that led to a historic drug bust ending mobster Sal Maroni's operation. The bomb explodes, killing Colson and knocking Batman unconscious.Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni's operation never actually ended and many GCPD officers are involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal money. As the Penguin flees, Selina discovers Annika's corpse in a car trunk. Batman captures the Penguin but learns that he was not the informant.Batman and Gordon follow the Riddler's trail to the ruins of an orphanage operated by Bruce's parents Thomas and Martha. They learn that the Riddler was a resident at the orphanage and holds a grudge against the Wayne family. Bruce's butler and caretaker, Alfred Pennyworth, is hospitalized after opening a letter bomb addressed to Bruce. The Riddler then leaks evidence that Thomas, who was running for mayor when he was murdered, hired Falcone to kill a journalist for threatening to reveal embarrassing details about Martha's history of mental illness. Bruce, who grew up believing his father was morally upstanding, confronts Alfred, who confirms the allegations but states that Thomas decided to turn Falcone over to the police after learning of the murder; Alfred surmises that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to prevent this.Selina tells Batman that Falcone is her neglectful father. She learns that Annika was strangled because Mitchell told her that Falcone was the informant, and resolves to kill him. Batman and Gordon arrive at the Iceberg Lounge in time to stop her. Batman physically prevents Selina from killing Falcone, explaining that she shouldn't allow Falcone to destroy her future through murdering him and facing prison. Batman escorts a cocky Falcone to the police, while Falcone tells Batman that he knows of all Gotham's hidden secrets and underworld dealings and that everything he knows dies with him. No sooner does Batman bring Falcone outside to the patrol waiting than Riddler snipes Falcone from his apartment window. Unmasked as forensics accountant Edward Nashton, the Riddler is incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital. Nashton says that, as a neglected orphan, he was envious of the sympathy Bruce received after his parents' murder. He idolizes Batman-who inspired him to target the corrupt-and proposes a partnership, but Batman angrily rejects him.Angered at being rejected by his idol, Nashton begins ranting to which Batman realizes that Nashton still has something planned. Upon realizing Batman hasn't figured out his next course of action, a delighted Nashton gives him one last clue by singing ""Ave Maria,"" the song sung at the Mitchell's funeral to imply that the final part of the plan is mayor-elect Bella Real's assassination. However, Batman fails to realize this and exclaims, ""What have you done!?""Searching his apartment, Batman is inadvertently aided by a cop who shows him a carpet cutting tool which Riddler had murdered the mayor with at the beginning. Realizing this tool is another clue to uncovering the Riddler's master plan, Batman cuts open the rug of the apartment and discovers via a map drawn on the floor underneath that Nashton has stationed car bombs around Gotham. No sooner has he done this than an online video of Nashton's final transmission before his capture and incarceration plays, explaining gleefully that he had cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect Bella Reál.The bombs destroy the breakwaters around Gotham and flood the city. A shelter is set up in an indoor arena, where Nashton's followers non-fatally shoot Reál but are stopped by Batman and Selina. While battling the cult atop the rafters, Batman defeats them but is almost killed by a last member who is about to execute Batman. Selina arrives and rescues Batman before kissing him, thanking him for preventing her from murdering Falcone. However, the member comes to and almost kills Selina with a knife. Batman is incapacitated from his injuries and unable to get up to protect Selina. He injects himself with adrenaline, gets up, and tackles the member to the ground. He has the member pinned down and beats his face savagely until he is stopped by Gordon and Selina. Gordon approaches the member and tears off his mask to reveal his swollen, bruised face. Gordon asks, ""Who the hell are you?"". The man responds, ""Me? I'm vengeance.""Batman sees a power line swinging just past the crowds in the flooded water below, throwing sparks everywhere as it flails wildly. Batman uses his grappling hook to swing toward the cord and grab onto it. Once he is hanging onto the cord, he uses his detachable bat emblem to sever it, causing him to be shocked by the electricity and fall down into the water. Batman rises from the water, lights a flare, and leads the survivors to safety. Batman aids recovery efforts and vows to inspire hope in Gotham, having seen that his weapon of fear has fueled the drive of vigilantes.Meanwhile in Arkham, Nashton is upset that his plan failed and wailing in his cell. A neighboring cell mate, who is largely obscured behind the steel door of his cell, proposes Nashton a riddle, asking, ""Riddle me this. The less you have of me, the more I am worth."" Nashton answers, ""A friend."" They laugh together.Selina deems Gotham to be beyond saving and tries to convince Batman to leave with her, but he declines. They set out to the streets on their motorcycles, playfully weaving around each other. When they get to a fork in the road, Selina goes right and Batman goes left. He looks back in his mirror as she disappears into the horizon. Then, he looks straight ahead."

There is a corpse covered up in the front of the house, and blood splattered all over the front porch. As Dentler goes inside, the deputy tells him to go inside the house to see something particularly gruesome, and Dentler is left stunned.One Day Earlier....Aspiring starlet Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) is getting ready to go down to Houston, Texas to shoot a porno film titled, ""The Farmer's Daughter"". Her boyfriend, executive producer Wayne (Martin Henderson), brings her along with the rest of the crew - writer/director R.J. (Owen Campbell), his girlfriend and sound operator Lorraine (Jenna Ortega), and actors/couple Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow) and Jackson (Scott Mescudi). Wayne refers to Lorraine as ""Churchmouse"" because he sees her as more prudish than the others, and Bobby-Lynne and Jackson make out on the way there.The crew arrives at the farmhouse where they are set to shoot the film. Wayne goes to talk to the elderly owner, Howard (Stephen Ure), who greets him with a rifle pointed at him. Wayne has to remind Howard that they spoke the other night about renting his place out, but once Howard notices the rest of the crew, he makes it clear that he does not like or trust any of them. While Maxine gets out of the van, she notices Howard's wife Pearl (also Mia Goth in a dual role) watching her from the window.Before filming begins, Maxine meets Pearl, who appears to try and make a pass at her. Pearl talks about her age and laments how she and Howard have not been intimate for a while.The crew gathers in the farmhouse, where the first scene has Jackson and Bobby-Lynne have sex, the premise of the film being that Jackson's car broke down and he comes upon Bobby-Lynne's house and propositions him before they film their scene. The next scene has Maxine playing the younger sister who also has sex with Jackson. Pearl watches the scene going on and appears to get aroused. She tells Howard she wants him to make love to her, but he declines since he feels his heart cannot take it.That night, Lorraine tells R.J. she wants a part in the movie, but he refuses. The others agree to allow Lorraine to have a part, as she wants to actually be part of the film and not just recording sound. The scene goes along, but R.J. goes to take a shower where he cries over it.R.J. begins to drive away to spitefully leave everyone behind, but he stops when he sees Pearl standing in the road. He tries to help her back into the house, but when she attempts to come onto him, he rebuffs her. R.J. continues to try to help, but Pearl stabs him in the neck and then repeatedly stabs him until he is dead, spraying the headlights with blood. Meanwhile, Wayne goes to look for R.J. in the farmhouse and ends up stepping on a nail while barefoot. He then hears something and looks through a hole in the wall, and Pearl impales him through the eye with a pitchfork, killing him.Lorraine gets up to go look for R.J., while Howard says that Pearl is missing. Lorraine goes into their house to look but ends up getting locked in the cellar by Howard. As she wanders, she turns around to find a man's nude corpse hanging. She screams and begins trying to break out.Howard gets Jackson to get up and help look for Pearl. They walk by the lake, where Jackson sees a car underwater. He turns around to find Howard saying he knows what Pearl has been up to, and then blasts Jackson in the chest with his shotgun, his corpse falling into the water.Pearl climbs into bed with Maxine, touching her back and leaving R.J.'s blood on her. Maxine turns around and sees Pearl, causing her to scream. Bobby-Lynne overhears and tries to help Maxine. She sees Pearl running out of the house and follows her to the lake. Bobby-Lynne tries to help Pearl back into the house, but Pearl calls her a whore and then pushes her into the lake, where she is eaten by an alligator.Lorraine gets an ax and tries to break through the door to escape, but she is caught by Howard, who slams her fingers with his own ax and severs one of them. Maxine hides in the couple's room under their bed when they come in. They talk about the murders, and Howard finally obliges Pearl and has sex with her. Maxine sneaks out and tries to go to the van, only to find the keys missing, but she sees R.J.'s corpse. She grabs Wayne's gun from the glove compartment.Maxine runs to the cellar to free Lorraine. While she tries to get them out, Lorraine blames Maxine for everything that has happened. Lorraine begins to run out of the house, only to get shot in the face by Howard. As he tries to drag her body inside, Lorraine lets out a dying cough, which startles Howard and causes him to suffer a fatal heart attack. Maxine gets the van keys and aims her gun at Pearl as the TV plays a video of a preacher, with Maxine saying ""I will have the life I deserve!"" just as the preacher does. Unfortunately, Maxine finds that the gun is unloaded. Pearl fires the shotgun at Maxine and misses, and the recoil is strong enough to blast her out of the house where she breaks her hip. Pearl asks for Maxine's help, and she refuses. Maxine gets into the van as Pearl calls her a whore, and Maxine runs over Pearl's head twice, causing it to burst.The following day, Sheriff Dentler and the other officers arrive. The video of the preacher keeps playing, and it is revealed that Maxine is his daughter, and he is searching for her. The deputy finds the camera used to film the porno. When he asks Dentler what he thinks is on it, he replies ""A goddamn fucked up horror show.""The end credits feature a trailer for an upcoming prequel film called ""Pearl""."

Unbeknownst to Ladybug, three other killers are on board: hit-men brothers Tangerine and Lemon, and deceptively innocent schoolgirl The Prince. Tangerine and Lemon have been hired by White Death, head of the world's largest crime syndicate, who seized control of the Japanese underworld years before.Having recovered the crime lord's kidnapped son and the briefcase containing his US$10 million ransom, the brothers are delivering both to Kyoto. The Prince summons another assassin, Yuichi Kimura, to the train, having pushed his young son off a building. With an associate at the hospital ready to finish the boy off, the Prince forces Kimura to cooperate with her plan: rigging the briefcase and Kimura's gun with explosives to kill White Death. Stealing the briefcase, Ladybug is forced to kill another assassin, The Wolf, who arrives seeking revenge for the deaths of his wife and his entire cartel, poisoned at their wedding.Realising the briefcase is missing, the brothers find White Death's son dead by poisoning. The Prince leads Tangerine to believe Ladybug is responsible, while Ladybug attempts to negotiate with Lemon but is forced to subdue him. Ladybug runs into the Wolf's intended target, The Hornet - the poisoner who massacred his wedding, hired to kill White Death's son. She stabs Ladybug with a syringe of boom-slang venom but he injects her as well, then saves himself with her only dose of anti-venom, and she dies instead.Fighting Tangerine to a stalemate, Ladybug tries to help him convince White Death's men that his son and the briefcase are safe, then kicks Tangerine off the train.

Climbing back inside the train, Tangerine finds his brother's body and confronts the Prince, but is fatally shot in a scuffle with Ladybug. Kimura's father, The Elder, boards the train and reveals himself as a former Yakuza lieutenant whose wife and clan were killed in White Death's rise to power.Ensuring his grandson's safety by having the Prince's associate killed, he and Ladybug find Kimura and Lemon still alive, and they all prepare for the ambush awaiting them. The train arrives in Kyoto, and Ladybug is met by White Death and his men. The Prince, revealed to be White Death's disgruntled daughter, tries to goad him into firing Kimura's booby-trapped gun, but he instead tells her she was never part of his plan. The White Death reveals that he hired all the assassins aboard the train as revenge for the murder of his wife.After Tangerine and Lemon massacred his men during a job in Bolivia, his wife was called to bail their son out of jail and was killed by Carver, who meant to assassinate her husband. And the surgeon who was going to save his wife was poisoned by the Hornet, ensuring her death by killing the one person who could've saved her. Blaming the brothers, Carver, the Hornet and his own son, White Death arranged for all the assassins - including the Wolf, and Ladybug, who unwittingly replaced Carver on the train - to kill each other and his son. Before White Death can kill Ladybug, the briefcase bomb is triggered, knocking them both onto the train which Lemon sets back in motion.As the train speeds out of control, the Elder duels White Death while Kimura and Ladybug fight off his henchmen. Lemon tackles a thug off the train into the river below, and the train derails, crashing into a nearby town. Ladybug is held at gunpoint by White Death. He attempts to shoot Ladybug, but is killed himself when Kimura's gun explodes.

Other guests include David's actress girlfriend Emma, the podcaster Alice, her much-older new boyfriend Greg, and the enigmatic Jordan. Max, another guest, left after a fight with David the night before Sophie and Bee arrived.After drinking, using drugs, and dancing, the group decides to play ""Bodies Bodies Bodies"", a murder in the dark-style game. Greg goes to bed early due to hostility throughout the game from David, who also leaves soon after another fight with Emma. As the storm worsens, the power goes out and the girls scramble to find a power source. Minutes later, Bee finds David outside with his throat slashed, a blood-stained kukri nearby. Panicked and without reception, the group try to go for help in Sophie's car, but find its battery dead.The group discovers Greg has a go bag with a knife and a map of the area and become suspicious of him. They fearfully confront Greg, who returns their hostility. After a struggle, Bee bludgeons him to death with a kettle bell in self-defense.The group doubt that Greg was the killer and Emma theorizes that Max, who had confessed feelings for her the night before, returned to kill David. Sophie, a sober addict, relapses. Emma kisses her, to Sophie's confusion, before accepting drugs. Alice later finds Emma dead from a head wound at the bottom of the stairs, and believes the group is being killed one by one. Jordan and Alice cast suspicion on Bee, revealing that no one with her name is on record as having graduated from her college; they cast Bee out into the hurricane.Returning to Sophie's car, Bee finds underwear that matches Jordan's bra in the backseat. She sees Jordan holding David's father's gun through a window, then crawls back inside through a pet door. Bee confronts the group, revealing that she dropped out of college to take care of her mother, who has borderline personality disorder. A vicious verbal fight ensues between the group. Jordan, who was the ""killer"" in the Bodies Bodies Bodies game, reveals resentment for Sophie due to her drug addiction and using David to regain access to her trust fund, and claims Sophie cheated on Bee with her, which Sophie denies. Sophie expresses why she would not date Jordan, that she avoids her friends because their behavior challenges her sobriety, and reveals that Jordan only ""hate-listens"" to Alice's podcast. After Alice responds by insulting Jordan's insecurities, Jordan shoots Alice in the leg. A struggle for the gun follows; Alice is fatally shot in the throat. As Sophie and Jordan fight, Bee pushes Jordan over the staircase bannister. With her dying breath, Jordan tells Bee to check Sophie's text messages. Bee hides from Sophie out of distrust.When morning comes and the storm has blown over, Sophie tearfully confesses to Bee that she relapsed and witnessed Emma tripping and falling down the stairs to her death. However, Bee holds her at gunpoint, demanding to see her texts. Sophie tosses her phone away and they struggle, inadvertently picking up David's phone in the process, which shows that David accidentally slashed his own throat while trying to use the kukri to open a champagne bottle for a TikTok video-revealing there was no real murderer after all.

In the present day, the laundromat is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); Waymond is trying to serve Evelyn divorce papers in an attempt to get her attention so they can talk about their marriage; Evelyn's stern and demanding father (referred to as Gong Gong (James Hong), Cantonese for 'grandfather') is visiting for her Chinese New Year party; and Joy is dealing with depression and has a strained relationship with her mother, which also includes Evelyn's reluctance to accept Joy's lesbian relationship with her non-Chinese girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel).At a tense meeting with IRS inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis), Waymond's body is taken over by Alpha-Waymond, a version of Waymond from the ""Alphaverse."" Alpha-Waymond explains to Evelyn that many parallel universes exist because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. The Alphaverse, led by the late Alpha-Evelyn, developed ""verse-jumping"" technology, which enables people to access the skills, memories, and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. The multiverse is threatened by Jobu Tupaki (Alpha-Joy), whose mind was splintered after Alpha-Evelyn pushed her to extensively verse-jump; Jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. She has created a black hole-like ""everything bagel"" topped with everything, which appears as a Toroid singularity that could destroy the multiverse.Alpha-Evelyn made it the task of the alpha-verse to find the one who can stand up to Jobu Tupaki.
While Evelyn goes into a different Universe, her body in the original universe stays, but her mind is not there. This happens during the audit meeting with Deirdre and the meeting is not going well. She says Evelyn is charging her hobbies as business expenses, and can be charged for fraud, or will have to pay a fine. In her confusion Evelyn strikes Deirdre during the audit who calls security. Alpha-Waymond appears again inside Waymond's body and helps Evelyn escape.
They are still trapped inside the IRS building as Dierdre from a tetra-verse appears inside Dierdre's body and blocks their path.Evelyn is given verse-jumping technology by Alpha-Waymond to fight Jobu's minions, who converge on the IRS building. She discovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished, such as becoming a Kung Fu master and film star; she also learns of Waymond's plans with the divorce papers. Evelyn uses her powers to defeat Alpha-Dierdre and the other minions. Jobu Tupaki directs all the minions to the IRS building in the original Evelyn's universe when she senses that Evelyn has started gaining powers.
Alpha-Waymond believes that Evelyn, as the greatest ""failure"" of all Evelyns in the multiverse, has the untapped potential to defeat Jobu. Gong Gong is taken over by Alpha-Gong Gong, who instructs Evelyn to kill Joy to stop Jobu from using her to enter Evelyn's universe.
Evelyn refuses and decides to face Jobu by gaining powers through repeated verse-jumping. Evelyn believes that the only way to defeat Jobu Tupaki is to become like her.
Alpha-Gong Gong, convinced that Evelyn's mind has been compromised like Jobu's, sends soldiers after Evelyn. While they fight, Jobu locates and kills Alpha-Waymond in the Alphaverse. As Jobu confronts Evelyn in her universe (she shows Evelyn the real bagel black hole and tells her that the real truth is that nothing matters), Evelyn's mind splinters, and she collapses.Evelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside Jobu across bizarre and diverse universes. Jobu reveals she does not want to fight at all, but that instead, she has been searching for an Evelyn who can see, as she does, that nothing matters, while killing the Evelyns that do not agree with her. She brings Evelyn to the everything bagel, explaining that she wants to use it to allow herself and Evelyn to truly die. Upon looking into the bagel, Evelyn is initially persuaded, and acts cruelly and Nihilistically in her other universes, hurting those around her (she even signs the divorce papers with Waymond and proceeds to destroy her own laundromat).As Evelyn is about to enter the bagel with Jobu, she pauses to listen to Waymond's pleas in her universe for everybody to stop fighting and to instead be kind, even when life does not make sense. In her home universe, Evelyn reconciles with Waymond, accepts Joy and Becky's relationship and tells Gong Gong of it, and talks with Deirdre after Waymond convinces Deirdre to let them redo their taxes
Evelyn has an existentialist epiphany and decides to follow Waymond's absurdist and humanist advice, using her multiverse powers to fight with empathy and brings happiness to those around her; in doing so, she repairs her damage in the other universes and neutralizes Alpha-Gong Gong and Jobu's fighters.
Jobu decides to enter the bagel alone while, simultaneously in Evelyn's universe, Joy begs Evelyn to let her go. Evelyn tells Joy that even when nothing makes sense and even though she could be anywhere else in the multiverse, she would always want to be with Joy. Evelyn and the others save Jobu from the bagel, and Evelyn and Joy embrace.Some time later, with the family's relationships improved, they return to the IRS building to refile their taxes. As Deirdre talks, Evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternative selves, before she grounds herself back in her home universe."

Laura, who witnessed her professor Gabriel Munoz bludgeon himself with a hammer just a few days earlier, frantically claims she is being haunted by a malevolent presence whose curse has consumed her life and no one but her can see. Although Rose diagnoses her as having hallucinations, Laura insists that the entity has the power to appear as other people wearing an eerie smile. Claiming she is about to die, Laura suddenly freaks out, then begins smiling ominously before cutting open her neck with a broken vase shard in front of Rose.One of the detectives who interviews Rose about Laura's death turns out to be her ex-boyfriend Joel. Still shaken by what she saw, Rose recounts what Laura told her about supposedly being cursed by an evil presence with a haunting smile.Rose begins seeing Laura smiling at her in various places. The visions inspire Rose to look into Gabriel Munoz's suicide and she learns Gabriel was also smiling strangely immediately before he died.Rose checks on her patient Carl Ranken, who was previously admitted to the hospital for a manic episode. Carl smiles ominously and begins threatening and terrifying Rose, which causes her to call security. Orderlies restrain Carl, but it turns out Rose only imagined his aggressive behavior. Believing that Laura's shocking death may have caused a mental breakdown, Rose's boss Dr. Morgan Desai puts Rose on one week's leave.Following another frightening vision of Laura, the security alarm goes off while Rose is home alone. An operator from the security service seemingly calls Rose with a taunting message. The real operator calls Rose shortly thereafter. After her fiancé Trevor returns home, Rose notices her cat is missing.Trevor has to calm Rose when she becomes suddenly spooked again while reviewing audio from her session with Laura. Concerned for own mental health, Rose visits her former therapist Dr. Madeline Northcott. Rose explains she is having hallucinations, which Madeline attributes to Rose's longstanding guilt over her mother's intentional overdose. Madeline denies Rose's request to prescribe anti-psychotic medication.Rose and Trevor attend a birthday party for Rose's seven-year-old nephew Jackson at Rose's sister Holly's house. Guests are mortified when Jackson opens Rose's gift to find her dead cat packaged inside. Vehemently insisting she isn't responsible, Rose trips and falls through a glass table after another vision of Laura terrifies her.With her sanity unraveling, Rose tries to tell Trevor about the supposed curse that plagued Laura apparently being passed on to her. Trevor dismissively accuses Rose of inheriting mental illness from her mother and of killing their cat.Rose visits Gabriel Munoz's widow Victoria. Victoria shows Rose macabre sketches Gabriel drew of a dark entity he claimed was trying to get inside him. Rose also learns Gabriel was traumatized by the death of his brother 20 years ago, and he began ranting about the curse after attending a conference where he saw a woman kill herself. Rose asks for the woman's name, but Victoria kicks Rose out of her house after Rose becomes insistent that Gabriel was telling the truth about his curse.Rose convinces Joel to help her continue connecting clues. Joel uses his police computer to access a file for Angela Powell, who was the real estate agent that Gabriel Munoz saw die. Additional video shows that, several days prior to her death, Angela saw a smiling man suddenly hack his own neck with gardening shears at a gas station.Rose returns home to find that Trevor called Madeline for an intervention over Rose's worrying mental state. Feeling betrayed, Rose storms out to take copies of Joel's files to her sister Holly. Rose tries telling Holly about the curse, which only leads to the sisters arguing about Rose behaving similarly to their abusive mother.Joel calls Rose to tell her that further digging revealed a chain of 20 similar cases involving witnesses to 19 suicides. The exception was accountant Robert Talley, who watched his business partner commit suicide. Instead of subsequently killing himself, however, Robert murdered a stranger four days later. One week after that, the eyewitness to Robert's actions committed suicide and the pattern resumed.Joel takes Rose to see Robert Talley in jail. During the drive, Rose tells a disbelieving Joel that she thinks the entity possesses people before they kill themselves and she worries her time with the curse is almost up.At the jail, Robert privately reveals to Rose that the only way to break the curse's chain is to kill someone else, but there has to be a witness because the entity needs trauma to continue surviving. Robert suddenly panics when he realizes Rose currently carries the curse.Madeline visits Rose back at home. Rose realizes the presence is impersonating Madeline when the real Madeline calls her on the phone. Madeline's smiling doppelganger threatens Rose.Armed with a kitchen knife, Rose drives to the hospital.

The other guests attending the dinner are Lillian, a food critic; her editor Ted; wealthy couple Richard and Anne; George, a post-prime movie star, and his personal assistant Felicity; and business partners Soren, Dave, and Bryce, along with Julian's alcoholic mother. The group is given a tour of the island by the restaurant Maître d'hôtel, Elsa, who notes that Margot was not Tyler's designated guest for the evening.Dinner begins, and Julian introduces a series of courses, delivering increasingly unsettling monologues about each meal. As the night goes on, secrets about each guest, ranging from affairs to money laundering, are slowly revealed amidst dialogue satirizing class divides, climate change, patriarchy hindering women's success (and creating unreasonable expectations for men), and capitalistic exploitation, usually spurred by Julian and the staff's introductions and meals. During the fourth course, a sous chef kills himself in front of the guests, and another staff member cuts off Richard's ring finger when he tries to escape. After the fourth course, the restaurant's prime investor, and Soren, Dave and Bryce's boss, is drowned in full view of the diners. At various points in the night, Julian allows guests to attempt escape, only to have the staff catch and return them.Julian declares all the guests were selected because they either contributed to him losing his passion for his craft or because they make a living off exploiting the work of artisans and workers like him and his team. He announces that everyone present will be dead by the end of the night. Since Margot's presence was unplanned, Julian privately gives her the choice of dying either with the staff or with the guests. When Margot hesitates, Julian decides for her, saying he knows his upper-crust customers from fellow service-industry workers.It is revealed that Margot is an escort named Erin, who has been hired before by Richard (explaining them staring at each other all night), and who Tyler has hired for the evening. Julian reveals that Tyler was invited personally and knew all along that the dinner would end with everyone's death, so he invited Margot knowing full well she would die. Julian humiliates Tyler further by forcing him to cook and insulting his food, causing Tyler to kill himself in a storeroom. Julian asks Margot to collect a barrel needed for dessert.Margot sneaks into Julian's house, only to be attacked by Elsa. Margot kills Elsa in self-defense by stabbing her in the neck. After seeing newspaper clippings of Julian's past life in his office, Margot finds a radio, calls for help and returns to the restaurant with the barrel. A Coast Guard officer arrives from his boat, then reveals himself to be a line cook in disguise and returns to the kitchen.Margot mocks Julian's dishes and complains that she is still hungry. When Julian asks what she would like to eat, Margot requests a cheeseburger and fries, having previously seen a photo of a younger, happier Julian working at a fast-food restaurant. Moved by her simple request, he prepares the meal to her specifications. Margot takes a bite and praises his food, then asks if she can get it ""to go"". Julian packs the food for her, and he and the staff allow her to leave. Margot takes the Coast Guard boat docked nearby and escapes the island.The dessert is an elevated s'mores dish - the staff cover the floor with crushed graham crackers and adorn the guests with small capes made of marshmallows and hats made of chocolate. Julian then sets the restaurant ablaze, detonating the barrel and killing the guests, staff, and himself as Margot watches from the boat and unpacks her cheeseburger to-go."

Despite being told that he was transporting a horse, Manny bribes the driver to carry the elephant. As they go up a hill, the elephant's weight causes the truck to start rolling downwards. Manny and his partner try to push the truck back up, and the elephant violently defecates on Manny's partner.Manny is helped by a convoy of other vehicles to take the elephant to the party located at a remote location. It is extravagant and over-the-top, with many nude or topless women and a cavalcade of drugs. Jazz musician Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo) plays with his band, and cabaret singer Lady Fay Zhu (Li Jun Li) performs a sultry song for the crowd. Arriving at the party is veteran actor Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt), whose wife Ina (Olivia Wilde) demands a divorce after he keeps speaking to her in Italian and not taking her seriously. Jack hooks up with a waitress during the party.Outside the mansion, Manny also sees as a young woman, named Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) and wearing a very revealing red dress, arrives as she crashes her car into a statue (clearly under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both). When the security guard tries to deny her entry, Manny helps get her inside. He brings Nellie to a room with drugs, and they snort cocaine together. Nellie talks about how she came from New Jersey and has aspirations for stardom, while Manny reveals that he was born in Mexico and wants to leave his mark on the film industry. Manny quickly falls in love with Nellie.During the party, a young actress, named Jane Thornton (Phoebe Tonkin), overdoses on drugs while partying with an older fat man and giving him a golden shower (urinating on him). Manny's boss Bob Levine (Flea) orders him and his co-worker to fix the problem. They set the elephant loose into the party, freaking out the other partygoers, so that they can sneak the unconscious Jane through the party unnoticed. A very high and intoxicated Nellie then dances her way through the crowd and makes an impression. As the party dies down, Nellie is given an invitation to be part of a film set since Jane was supposed to have the role.At dawn, Manny is instructed by Bob to take a passed-out Jack back to his house. Despite a brief drunken display, and a tumble over the balcony into his pool, Jack remains fine and requests for Manny to stick around with him.Later that day, Jack goes to work on a crusader epic film. Manny is brought along to handle the extras, who charge after him until he grabs a gun and rides a horse to scare them off. The horses wreck all the cameras, and the director (Spike Jonze) wants to get his closing shot before the sun sets. Manny drives to a camera shop and waits over an hour for the last available camera. With little time left, Manny steals an ambulance and makes it back to the set in time for the crew to get a sweeping shot of Jack kissing the leading lady, with a butterfly landing on him for extra flair. The crew cheers.While all of this is going on, Nellie shows up to the set and meets the director, Ruth Adler (Olivia Hamilton) and her assistant director Max (PJ Byrne). Although Olivia was hoping for the other actress ""with the tits"", she settles for Nellie. She is set to play a role in a silent western film where she enters a bar and puts on a crude display. The film's lead actress, Constance Moore (Samara Weaving), arrives and is upstaged by Nellie, who impresses both Ruth and a visiting Wallach with her acting. A nearby set fire almost derails the production, but Ruth orders the cameras to continue rolling.In 1927, Nellie's stardom begins to rise in Hollywood, with her work on the film continuing to outdo Constance, who is angry because it's her money going into the film. Nellie's father Robert (Eric Roberts) arrives and attempts to capitalize off her newfound fame. Meanwhile, Jack helps Manny get assistant work on films. Jack marries a Hungarian actress, named Olga Putti (Karolina Szymczak), but she shoots him in the arm after learning that he cheated on her.Manny goes to the theater and watches ""The Jazz Singer"", one of the first ""talkie"" films. He goes outside and calls Jack from a payphone to let him know that things are about to change.In 1928, in New York City, Manny is there on business when he finds Nellie again after getting her away from crazed fans and photographers after she attends the screening of her latest film. While riding away from the scene in a taxi, Nellie talks to him about peoples' perception of her and how she tries to not let that define her. Manny accompanies her to visit her mother (Vanessa Bednar), who is institutionalized at a local asylum.A few days later back in Hollywood, Nellie goes to work on a talking picture, but the set is too hot and causes stress on her, plus Ruth since she is badgered by the sound mixer Lloyd (Carson Higgins) over how loud or how quiet Nellie is, along with other distractions. One of the crew members begs to be let out of the recording booth since it is too hot, but Max forces him to stay there. They refuse to use any air conditioning because the sound from the AC is interfering with the film. After the crew finally gets a successful take (after eight tries), everyone cheers until the crew member collapses dead out of the booth from heatstroke.Another evening or two later, Manny goes to another wild party where Jack arrives with his third wife, Estelle (Katherine Waterston). Sidney and his band are playing, while Fay is also a guest. Nellie arrives being carried by a football team and takes an opportunity to kiss Jack in front of Estelle. Fay takes a moment to perform a sensual dance with Nellie, which is ruined by a drunk partygoer pushing through them. When she goes to the bathroom to freshen up, Nellie overhears two men talking about how she has no talent and has a voice like a dying pig, which hurts her feelings. She then goes outside and sees her dad talking to another woman about fighting a snake. Nellie calls everyone out and asks if anyone wants to see Robert fight a snake, to which the crowd responds with a cheer.Jack, Nellie, Manny, Fay, Robert, and other guests drive into the desert where Nellie encounters a rattlesnake and tells Robert to fight it. Robert gets himself into a fighting position, but he passes out. Nellie then opts to fight the snake herself, despite the warnings of everyone else. Nellie grabs the snake, which bites her neck. After she frantically runs around and the others fail to help her, Fay grabs a knife and decapitates the snake before sucking the venom out of Nellie's neck. When Nellie regains consciousness, she passionately kisses Fay.Some time later, Manny recommends Sidney for a job at Kinoscope Studios. Bob is impressed with Manny's work and offers him an executive position, but he tells Manny that he needs to do something about Nellie, as her reputation is going downhill due to her constant partying and gambling, as well as her alleged relationship with Fay, which gets Fay fired since Hollywood is becoming more puritanical. Nellie overhears Manny's pitch to the higher-ups about fixing her reputation, setting her up with gossip journalist Elinor St. John (Jean Smart) to fix her up.Sidney begins working at Kinoscope Studios since black-led films are taking off. However, he becomes upset and uncomfortable when Manny suggests he apply black face makeup. After a successful filming session where Sidney performs with his jazz band, he leaves the studio for good and never looks back.Jack learns that his close friend George Munn (Lukas Haas) killed a woman he was having an affair with and then committed suicide. Jack is distraught and gets into an argument with Estelle when she refers to his work as ""low art"".In 1930, Hollywood has completely transitioned into talking films. Manny and Elinor have worked hard trying to revamp Nellie's image. She is brought to a swank party with other snotty upper-class socialites and film people in attendance, and she attempts to project a more posh and sophisticated image. However, Nellie can no longer pretend to hide her disdain for the other guests and goes off on a profane tirade before pigging out on the food and storming out. Seconds later, she walks back in to projectile-vomit on the rug and on the face of the party's host.In 1932, Jack finds his career going in decline. He continues to work for Kinoscope in low-budget films, but he goes to a theater and finds an audience laughing at his performance in his latest film. Jack also reads a column written by Elinor after she interviewed him about his star fading, and he goes to confront her. She bluntly tells him that his time as an actor is over, but he and everyone else in his time will be immortalized with their films for future generations, so he can take comfort in knowing that they have left their mark on the industry. Jack later gets a phone call from executive Irving Thalberg (Max Minghella), who initially states that he's got a good project for him, but Jack knows it would be a favor for him and that the project sucks, which Thalberg admits to.One evening, Manny is visited at his home by a disheveled and panicked Nellie. She tells him that she owes over $85,000 in gambling debts to a gangster, and if she doesn't pay up by the end of the week, they will pour acid onto her genitals. Manny initially refuses to help, but seeing how distraught Nellie is, and remembering their time together and how much he cares about her, he decides to help. He goes to ""The Count"" (Rory Scovel), a long-time co-worker who pushed drugs on sets and is also an aspiring actor.Manny and The Count go to the home of the gangster, James McKay (Tobey Maguire), with the bag of money in tow. When McKay goes to fetch drinks, The Count reveals that the bag is filled with prop money, which makes Manny extremely nervous. McKay invites the two, along with his thug Wilson (Ethan Suplee), to an underground location (an abandoned mine) where depraved sex acts are taking place. McKay guides them to see their main attraction, a brutish man who eats lives rats. When McKay starts throwing the prop money at the man, he finds a drop of water on it and realizes it's fake. Manny grabs a mace and jams it into Wilson's neck, and the other men chase after them. Manny sets loose a chained alligator and continues running with The Count, narrowly escaping gunfire.The next day, Manny gets Nellie and urges her to join him in running away to Mexico. Together with The Count, they pack their bags and go to find gas. As Manny begins pumping, Nellie walks into a party and begins dancing. When Manny stresses that they need to go soon, Nellie breaks down over all the trouble she has put Manny through, especially as he tells her how much he loves her. They agree to marry in Mexico and start a new life. A nearby photographer records Manny and Nellie dancing as they share their first kiss.That afternoon, Jack is at a party with his newest girlfriend. He runs into Fay one last time, as she tells him she is heading to Europe to work for Pathé Studios. They say goodbye, and Fay looks back at Jack sadly. Jack then quietly walks up to his hotel room and grabs a gun, shooting himself in the head.That evening, Manny goes to The Count's apartment to get the last of their things, leaving Nellie in the car to wait for him, but she feels she is no good for Manny and dreamily dances away into the darkness. One of McKay's thugs shows up and kills The Count and his roommate. Manny begs for his life, even wetting himself, but the thug orders Manny to leave Los Angeles. Manny hops in his car and books it.A brief montage shows people attending Jack's funeral, along with newspaper articles announcing Elinor's death at 76, and Nellie being found dead in her hotel room at age 34.In a jump forward to the year 1952, Manny returns to Los Angeles with his wife and young daughter. He stops at Kinoscope Studios and talks to a security guard, stating that he has a successful business in New York. While the wife and daughter go back to their hotel, Manny goes to the movies to watch ""Singin' in the Rain"". He notes many similarities between the film and his time with Nellie, which brings him to tears as he misses her. Another montage shows the evolution of films from the silent era through the 20th century, to more contemporary films like ""Terminator"", ""The Matrix"", and ""Avatar"". Realizing that he achieved his dream of leaving his mark on the industry, Manny smiles through his tears."

Once a familiar threat returns to finish what was previously started, Jake must work with Neytiri and the army of the Na'vi race to protect their home.","More than a decade after the Na'Vi repelled the human invasion of Pandora, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) (a former human who fell in love with Neytiri and befriended the Na'Vi after becoming a member of the Avatar Program, eventually taking their side in their conflict with humans and leading them to victory. He left his human body to permanently become one of the Na'Vi) lives as chief of the Omaticaya clan and raises a family with Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña), which includes his sons, Neteyam (James Flatters) and Lo'Ak (Britain Dalton); his biological daughter, Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss); his adopted daughter; Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) (born from Grace Augustine's inert Na'Vi avatar); and a human boy named Miles Socorro ""Spider"" (Jack Champion), the son of Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) (Colonel Miles Quaritch, a human who led the security forces of the RDA, the human organization colonizing Pandora, in their conflict with the Na'Vi) who was born on Pandora and was unable to be transported to Earth in Cryostasis due to his young age.the Na'Vi sent all the humans back home, but kept the scientists like Norm and Max, to help continue their study of the Na'Vi ecology and biology.
To the Na'Vi's dismay, humans return to Pandora to prepare it for colonization, as Earth is dying. They erect a new main operating base named ""Bridgehead City"". Among the new arrivals are ""Recombinants"", Na'Vi avatars with the memories of deceased RDA marines, with Quaritch's Recombinant as their leader. General Frances Ardmore (Edie Falco) is the commander in charge of the planet.Jake initiates a guerrilla campaign against the RDA supply lines by attacking a Maglev train carrying weapons. Quaritch and his Recombinants conduct a counterinsurgency mission against Jake (they are dropped close to the magnetic mountains in the hope that the Na'Vi DNA will not trigger the immune response from the local ecosystem), capturing his children (The children come across Miles's team looking for footage of their last encounter with Jake and Neytiri, when they are cut off and captured by Miles. Spider learns that Miles is his father and that he was killed by Neytiri). Jake and Neytiri arrive and free most of them, but Spider is taken by Quaritch, who recognizes him as his son. He decides to spend time with him in order to draw Spider on his side, and in turn, Spider teaches Quaritch about Na'Vi culture and language.Aware of the danger Spider's knowledge (he knew their entire base and tactics of operations) of his whereabouts poses to their safety, Jake and his family exile themselves from the Omaticaya and retreat to the Metkayina reef people clan at Pandora's eastern seaboard, where they are given shelter, even though some tribesmen consider them to have ""demon blood"" for their genetic human heritage. The family learns the ways of the reef people, Kiri develops a spiritual bond with the sea and its creatures (she gets the ability to summon and command them), and Lo'Ak befriends Tsireya (Bailey Bass) (a graceful and strong free diver of the Metkayina), the daughter of clan chief Tonowari (Cliff Curtis) and his wife Ronal (Kate Winslet) (a free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari's wife, who is pregnant). Jake tells Tonowari that he has left the war behind him and only seeks safety of his family. He is allowed to stay, and Jake is very keen to ensure that his family respect the ways of the MetkayinaLo'Ak gets into a fight with Tsireya's brother Aonung (Filip Geljo). When he returns to apologize at Jake's insistence, Aonung and his friends entice him to a trip into the territory of a dangerous sea predator and leave him stranded on purpose and far away from their village. Lo'Ak is attacked by the predator and is about to be killed, when it is saved by and befriends Payakan, a Tulkun, an intelligent and pacifistic cetacean species whom the Metkayina consider their spiritual family. Payakan is a loner and sees Lo'Ak also as a loner and hence saves him.
Upon his return, Lo'Ak takes the blame on himself, winning Aonung's friendship, but is told that Payakan is an outcast among his species.On a trip to the Metkayina's Tree of Souls, Kiri links with it to meet her mother, but suffers a violent seizure. She is healed by Ronal, but when Jake calls Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore) and Max Patel (Dileep Rao) for help, Quaritch is able to track them to the archipelago where the reef people live. Bringing Spider with him, he commandeers a whaling vessel (led by Captain Mick Scoresby (Brendan Cowell), the head of a private sector marine hunting vessel on the planet of Pandora & Dr. Ian Garvin (Jemaine Clement), a marine biologist) which is hunting Tulkuns to harvest their brain enzymes for creating anti-aging remedies named Amrita. Quaritch begins to brutally question the indigenous tribes about Jake's location; failing that, he orders the whaling crew to wantonly kill the Tulkuns in order to draw Jake out.
Lo'Ak mentally links with Payakan and learns that the Tulkun was cast out because he went against the ways of his species and attacked the whalers who killed his mother. In the attack, many Tulkun were killed and Payakan was blamed for using violence and violating the ways of their species.When the Metkayina learn of the Tulkun killings, Lo'Ak takes off to warn Payakan, followed by his siblings, Tsireya, Aonung and Rotxo (Duane Evans, Jr.). They find Payakan being chased by the whalers, and Lo'Ak, Tsireya, and Tuk are captured by Quaritch. With their children in danger, Jake, Neytiri, and the Metkayina set out to confront the humans. Quaritch forces Jake to surrender, but seeing his soul brother imperiled, Payakan attacks the whalers, triggering a fight that kills most of the crew and critically damages the vessel, causing it to sink. Neteyam rescues Lo'Ak, Tsireya and Spider, but is fatally shot and killed. Jake faces Quaritch, who uses Kiri as a hostage. When Neytiri does the same with Spider, Quaritch at first denies his relationship with him but desists when Neytiri cuts Spider across the chest.
A fight ensues between Jake and Miles as the vessel continues to sink.Jake, Quaritch, Neytiri, and Tuk end up trapped inside the sinking vessel. Jake strangles Quaritch into unconsciousness and is rescued by Lo'Ak and Payakan, and Kiri summons sea creatures to help her save Neytiri and Tuk. Spider finds and rescues Quaritch, but renounces him for his cruelty and rejoins Jake's family. After Neteyam's funeral, Jake informs Tonowari and Ronal of his decision to leave the Metkayina. Tonowari, however, respectfully identifies him as part of the clan and welcomes his family to stay. Jake and his family accept and forge a new life at sea, with Jake vowing to keep fighting the human invaders."

He quickly learns that Peterson is dead, having been killed after falling down drunk before a car ran over his head outside the exclusive luxury Corbata Club. Marlowe visits Cavendish to tell her of Peterson's demise, also meeting the Pacific's owner, Philip O'Reilly, the soon-to-be Ambassador to England. O'Reilly is also the financial advisor to Clare's mother.
Clare is married to Richard (Patrick Muldoon). Clare tells Richard that Marlowe is helping her find a missing necklace.
Marlowe also learns from a homeless guy, living across Peterson's house, that he had seen people coming and going from the house. 2 guys coming to Peterson's house asking for him, had come from Mexico. The car was stolen and was re-sprayed in Mexico.Cavendish reveals she has seen Peterson since his supposed death, driving past her in Tijuana, Mexico. Clare says that Nico was a collector and stored his antiques in his aquarium.
Annoyed at her withholding this information, Marlowe goes to leave, running into Cavendish's mother, film star Dorothy Quincannon (Jessica Lange), who fails to learn what service Marlowe is providing to her daughter.Marlowe visits Peterson's grave and encounters a mourning woman but she escapes before he can talk to her. Marlowe convinces his friend, homicide detective Joe Green (Ian Hart), to open a murder investigation now they know the body was not Peterson's. Green admonishes Marlowe for his relentless pursuit of the truth and reveals that the body was identified by the Corbata Club owner, Floyd Hanson (Danny Huston).
Marlowe meets with Hanson at the club, the pair failing to extract information from each other. Hanson maintains that Nico is dead, and he died on a public road. He refuses to say who is the owner of the club. Marlowe reveals to Hanson that Nico might be alive.
While leaving, Marlowe notices the woman from the grave, Peterson's sister Lynn (Daniela Melchior), and clandestinely agrees to meet with her at the Cabana club later that evening; their discussion is observed by Hanson. When he arrives, Marlowe is assaulted by two men but beats them unconscious.Quincannon tries to hire Marlowe to find Peterson for her instead. She reveals that her contentious relationship with her daughter is because she spent many years pretending Cavendish was her niece on the advice of O'Reilly, Dorothy's former lover. Dorothy says that acknowledging having a daughter would not have been good for her movie career. Dorothy says that Clare is unstable, like her father, who committed suicide before she was born.Quincannon's former private investigator had learned that Peterson was also acting as a talent agent for actress Amanda Toxteth (Seána Kerslake). Toxteth tells Marlowe that Peterson was a serial womanizer and regularly imported cocaine from Tijuana.
Amanda also says that Nico was seeing Clare, the actress with the terrible mother Dorothy. She says that O'Reilly kept Dorothy and even bought a studio for, where Dorothy was a slave for many years.
Out of leads, Marlowe breaks into Peterson's house and encounters Lynn before the pair are attacked by two Mexican men looking for someone named Serena. Marlowe is knocked unconscious while Lynn is taken captive.After waking, Marlowe is taken by drug lord Lou Hendricks (Alan Cumming) and his henchman Cedric (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Hendricks reveals he is after Peterson, his former drug courier, who stole a large amount of cocaine and the Corbata helped fake Peterson's death. Marlowe has his officer friend Bernie Ohls (Colm Meaney) begin searching for Lynn, while Cavendish visits Marlowe to seduce him; he rejects her advances but shares a dance before she leaves.
Marlowe secretly follows Cavendish to a rendezvous with O'Reilly and runs into Quincannon who shares her anger at her daughter's relationship with the much older and powerful O'Reilly.
The following day, Ohls takes Marlowe to Lynn's body, revealing she was tortured and raped before being killed. Ohls traces the Mexicans to the Corbata club and gives Marlowe his unofficial support to infiltrate the club and avenge Lynn.Marlowe confronts Hanson who offers him a drink. Marlowe says that Lynn was addicted to cocaine and worked for Hanson, who was basically her pimp.
Marlowe is suspicious Hanson poisoned it, Marlowe throws it away and feigns that he is dying. Convinced he is dead, Hanson has his men take Marlowe's body through the hedonistic areas of the club to a secret area where the Mexicans have been killed, Hendricks is being tortured, and Cedric has been restrained. Under torture, Hendricks reveals that Serena is actually the mermaid statue Peterson placed in the adjacent fish tank and it contains the missing cocaine. Marlowe frees Cedric and the pair kill Hanson and his men, inadvertently destroying the mermaid and the drugs. Cedric also kills Hendricks after being told he will be indebted for years to repay the value of the drugs. Cedric decides to work with Marlowe so they can look out for each other.Marlowe returns home to find Peterson waiting for him. Peterson admits he does not feel guilty about Lynn's death because of her association with him and asks Marlowe to tell Cavendish to meet him in the studio prop house for information he has gathered about O'Reilly.The fake Peterson was a musician who resembled Peterson. Peterson meets Cavendish and reveals his extensive records of every drug deal performed through the prop house with Hendricks, believing it will destroy the reputation of the studio and O'Reilly.
Dorothy sought Nico to expose O'Reilly, while Clare sought Nico to protect O'Reilly.As Marlowe arrives, Cavendish betrays Peterson, shooting him and setting both him and the evidence on fire, immolating the prop house, intending to use this deed to earn favor with O'Reilly and become vice president of the studio. Dorothy starts acting in studio's pictures again.

After their orphanage kicks him out because of his third strike, Sam sneaks out to be on his own but promises Nate he'll return, and leaves him a ring belonging to their ancestor Sir Francis Drake.Fifteen years later, Nate works as a bartender in New York City and pickpockets wealthy patrons. Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan, a fortune hunter who worked with Sam tracking treasure hidden by the Magellan crew, explains to Nate that Sam vanished after helping him steal Juan Sebastian Elcano's diary.

Sully and Nate go to an auction to steal a golden cross linked to the Magellan crew, where they meet Santiago Moncada, the last descendant of the Moncada family, and Jo Braddock, leader of Moncada's mercenaries. Nate is ambushed by Braddock's men, and the ensuing fight creates a distraction for Sully to steal the cross.The duo travel to Barcelona, where the treasure is supposedly hidden, and rendezvous with Sully's contact Chloe Frazer, who has another cross. Meanwhile, Moncada, learning from his father that their family fortune will be donated, orders Braddock to kill his father, so that he will inherit the money instead. Nate, Chloe, and Sully follow clues in Elcano's diary to Santa Maria del Pi, finding a secret crypt behind the altar. Nate and Chloe enter, finding a trapdoor, but as they open it, the crypt floods with water. Sully helps them escape after subduing an ambush by Braddock.
